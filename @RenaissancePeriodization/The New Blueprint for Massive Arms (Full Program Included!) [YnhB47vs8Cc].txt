This whole thing of like man feel pretty good in day bro Let's sort of the plate on the bicep curl. That is not a thing that that get you hurt But it will not get you anymore jack now here's the thing you can get stronger faster by adding more weight to the bar And you can tell people how strong you are at the club as they look at your small arms with Inchradulity in their face your systemic um, RV is here That lets us get up to very high volumes only for the arms That my brothers and sisters in iron and steel is how you get the biggest arms that you can Hey folks Dr. Mike here for RP strength and you have a distinct problem your arms are not big enough and you need the solution now That's good because today we're gonna talk about how to get big arms now and even help you design a program That will get you big arms now and by now I mean but in three or four months because I mean like not literally now Me and if you buy some thaw on the internet and do an irresponsible thing like injecting into two arms you will have big arms now But They're gonna look goofy and that's gonna destroy your actual muscle So if you have a few months to put in to training you can get much bigger arms and the end of this video will actually help you design a workout for your big arms for a five day split that prioritizes massive arms And if you are just so busy with Theo stuff and Making ish happen that you can't be bothered to make your own workout that literal workout as of the release of this video will exist in the RP high Perch of the app and It will be called big arms now Yeah, oh, we're serious folks. All right Let's get to it. So yeah, I'm not just trying to hawk the app and saw you guys workout. So it's cool if you want to buy them However, however, well, we are here to do is understand Why the garms are important not a very long description The fundamentals of how to get big arms the how and the why and then Later a very not so long period of time is how to make the actual program because once you understand what's going on Making the actual program is a very easy. If you don't understand what's going on making the actual program is Like walking through a mine field where like yeah, you can put one foot in front of the other but you have no idea if you're on the right track And technically speaking Scott, let me ask your question If you got your leg blown off by a mine Versus if you never had big arms which ones worse? Oh my goodness never having big arms for sure for sure Because if you have big arms and you have like a cybernetic leg do your Swimming in it that's it over so first of all why big arms Let's go through a couple scenarios you're at the beach big arms You're at the club big arms Meaning your X's new boyfriend you're on good terms with your X hey This is Frank. He's like really sweet to me. It's gonna be nice to him a Frank Yeah big arms now Frank knows where he la you know what's saying where he places in life Second to you later that night your axis like Frank like why can't you do like hard for me Dude, he's like I don't know she love like Just like your X man. She's like what a bottom he was like all news. I told you I don't love him Yeah, but He's just bigger arms than me then you know Scott that's a thing that if you let your current girlfriend meet your X Especially if you're on good terms with your X and the X is just like a bejectively hotter That's like a problem right? Like you're gonna hear about it probably on the right home Or you'll get that like you get back to the hotel room and she just like cuddles into bed and turns away from you and you're like baby What's going on she's like I'm just like I'm good. I'm okay Do you still think about her and then you're in some real shit? That's a few hours of arguing all right If you happen to be Oh, oh father and a husband you're not into the whole club scene. You're not into getting some touch-touch You're picking your kindergarten route from school big arms Yeah, schools out now and that is my kindergarten There's a guy in an unmarked van pulling up to the elementary school you step out to pick up your kids and he just Just accelerates drives away and he never comes back that's how that works and Myself I have been in a few intergalactic hostage rescue situations Nine times out of ten big arms will get you out of that as well fundamentally the end of the aljox side Big arms for any male physique just make you look cooler like Go into a photo shop or go talk to chat should be tea Post up a picture of some bodybuilder and be like can you make this? Have bigger arms and it's gonna look better with bigger arms nine times out of ten nine the nine times out of a hundred Yeah, 100 times out of a hundred so How to get big arms You can just train your whole body and Your arms will get bigger and there's nothing wrong with that however if you want Especially bigger arms relative to the rest of you which you do That's why you're watching this video remember You can take advantage of the massive massive idea of short-term specialization what the hell is that? well Here's the thing Most of your muscles Have really high per muscle mrv's maximum recoverable volumes the total amount of work You can do for that muscle and it still makes adaptations the steel grows instead of goes Dude, I can't do this anymore. I'm over trained you're killing me I'm actually gonna get small I'm gonna get hurt So any given muscle you can train a ton But your systemic mrv your total bodies ability recover is usually substantially more limited and the bigger and stronger Get the more limited is so if we took all of the mrv's of all of your individual muscles and just add it them up The total number of sets per week that would be would be like double what you could survive in an actual workout situation How do I mean this when people get bigger and stronger? They're typically able to handle something like 10-ish maybe 15-ish Maybe maybe maybe maybe 20 sets per muscle per week for their whole body, right? Those like calves and biceps and triceps and chast and back and legs all that stuff together Each one of those is somewhere between 10 and 20 probably closer to 10 to 15 sets per week is within a maximum Recoverable volume for most people but it's close, right? That's a lot and you're gonna need to reload every you know Four to six weeks for that sort of thing be able to be possible however numerous studies now confirm beyond any very reasonable doubt Then in any one given muscle the local mrv for that muscle If you don't have to worry about the system is usually somewhere between 15 to 20 to 25 to 30 and if I'm being very transparent about the state of the scientific literature currently I have to be frank and tell you which we haven't found a top and reliable mrv for muscles There are numerous studies in which I will say relatively untrained people train their quads and up through 45 sets per week of quads how do they get to that they do five sets of one quad exercise? I think one of the studies is something like five sets of like extensions five sets of like press and then five sets of squats Monday Wednesday and Friday Okay in the group that did like 30-ish sets grew less than the group that did 45 sets in the quads So first of all don't just go out there do 45 quads. That's uh you're gonna grab my Lysis these folks worked into it they took a nice long time to work up to values like that don't be it don't be here But there are many other studies now confirming the fact that as you do more volume You get fewer and fewer extra gains but they're extra gains and There has been no reliable top end and we know very concretely that the conversation for that theoretical top end At which you're at your mrv locally and after which you actually grow less and start to degenerate muscle if you train anymore That conversation almost certainly does not start below 30 sets for most people per muscle per week So all of a sudden you that's can see we're going with this if your mrv or maximum or call Revolving per muscle for if you train multiple muscles as hard as you can in the body Is like 20-ish for many people not all there's a big variation But if for that average group of people their per muscle mrv is probably over 30 Then we have a very interesting Unfortunately reality which is like man I want to grow all over as much as possible you can't do it Especially not as an intermediate very much not as an advanced lifter Be enters just grow no matter what but it's dope to be a beginner Scott it's one of those things were like you are getting excellent growth but because you're beginner no one can tell And no one gives a shit It's like when someone is trained for two years, but like man I made my best games on xyz program you're like what games mother Nobody cares All jokes aside We have this interesting situation where I say okay If I want really big arms And I know that my biceps and triceps and four arms Hypothetically grow best north of 20 sets Per muscle per week for each one of them But if I do them in the context of a whole body program in which I'm trying to know everything I really probably can't do more than 20 sets That is where specialization comes from so you take A bunch of your muscles half or more of your muscles and in the program we're gonna be designing later all of your muscles Accept for your arms and put in them down to maintenance volume Here's another really really cool thing that makes the specialization concept very tentable Specialization is not a thing really desired And decided to do it's a thing that kind of falls out from the data and personal experience Like this is just the way it is it's like nobody planned for tall people to be better at basketball We get people planned basketball. You just realize tall people are better at it and then later you realize I as I make sense like you could be short and fast, but tall people are better at blocking They're closer to the net so they can shoot an unimpeded and there you go better reach all that stuff So another cool feature like this to sort of make this whole idea of specialization fall out from the data Is that maintenance volume the amount of volume you have to train your muscles if you just want to maintain them You don't care if they grow because you'll grow them later or they're just not a priority right now She just don't want them to shrink that amount is Incredibly low and I estimated roughly through compilation of a lot of data sources and personal experience in coaching experience talking other people Is for many people it's Especially in a surplus which is probably how you should be eating if you want the biggest arms for a few months of training Is something like and I kid you not four hard sets per muscle per week here's what I mean by that if you train your chest Untoose day and on Thursday Something like that Tuesday Friday whatever With two sets hard sets close to failure heavy challenging in each workout two sets on each day two days a week That's four of my math serves me Well Scott if I'm was his name Terence Howard Oh yeah, maybe not Make up whatever math you want it. That's okay. I was what you see it's actually six and a half oh All right, oh it is Do you remember when Eric wine seemed to bathe at him and it was like the kind of this thing Eric's ever done in his life He's like I see where you're coming from I just be like you're literally really mentally ill and you need to be in a hospital That is all I have to say about that I mean maybe someday I'll be card it off of Rogan for Dude I end up getting on Rogan and he's like you're gonna have to debate Kanye West Okay, that would actually be really fun, you know I would probably start with be like Kanye. I think you're one of the most overrated musicians of all time I think you're a great person and I could completely agree with all of your stuff about the Jews But as a musician I think you just have the biggest hype and you're actually terrible Do you think Scott do you think he would take that incredibly personally? I probably that's probably the most hurtful thing How are you arguing can you convince strategy there Mike? What do you think the better argument to convince is like Kanye? I really want to believe that you're an amazing musician But I just can't see it. Can you like sing from you right now so that I can like In any case where the hell do we get in this? Four sets per week like that split over two sessions will almost certainly for almost everyone Continue to maintain their size and strength kind of indefinitely and that's Really trippy realization it gives us a huge unlock Remember earlier when we stacked up all the MRVs of all the muscles and realized they're like double what the systemic MRV is Well guess what you take 20 sets per week that you're doing for quads go to four The shit falls down you take chest four hamstrings four back four and so on shoulders four And all of a sudden your systemic MRV is here and if you're training arms normally Your your some of all muscles that you're doing volume wise is below That lets us get up to very high volumes only for the arms and get only their arms into the ideal growth range That my brothers and sisters in iron and steel is how you get the biggest arms that you can So for three or four months at a time basically three mesocycles like four to six weeks of accumulation one week of deal load Are pay a purchase of your app does all that for you? You stack three of those cycles together and you have everything at maintenance except for your farms your biceps and your triceps You are gonna be having bigger arms If and only if you don't just train your arms regular but you start at pretty high volumes and you end it very very high volumes That's how you do it now you might say to me look biceps triceps. I get but why for arms Get to Google type in frank mograph and Shot up and that's easy but if you're not convinced type in Lee priest and then shot up again And if I'm being too mean don't shut up run outside and yell at random people about how Lee priest and frank mographs forms make them real man with gigantic forms Scott remember those guys um then world war two that landed on the beaches of Ewo Gman stuff and those people like that work and oirig they have really small forms right? False the real man and they have big forms and honestly the purpose of a form functionally when you're giant man Is to physically grab a woman by her small ways to make her feel feminine and dating Is that the sound they make Scott? I don't know I've never seen one Isn't that I mean oh yeah for or your own displacement Yes, that's good that's what you get paid for or a for a large forum for that matter and those two are related If Scott had an enormous form he would be a father of a family of five at this point All right, let's talk technical stuff. How do we get big arms okay specializations great? We've said okay. We're gonna really cook the arms and how do we do it specifically check this out? What training frequency do we want how often we're gonna train arms? No, I'm's everyday brother That's cool. Is anything wrong with them but typically it beats up your joints a lot and you have to do pretty low volumes every day Just so you can heal for tomorrow So they could better approach is somebody in two and four sessions per week for many people Three sessions per week is a real good sweet spot and since many of you trained like five days a week which is a very rational amount of time to train Then my preferred split is gonna be Monday Wednesday Friday as arms and then chest back Legs and shoulders are gonna be Tuesdays and Thursdays if you really want to really spread things out and be super psychotic Tuesdays and Saturdays but it just doesn't matter much Seriously because you're at maintenance You're not gonna get sore or messed up from Tuesday you'll be totally fine Thursday. It's all Gucci That gives you five day split Monday Wednesday Friday you are cooking your arms to the hilt And that three day thing allows you to both train very frequently which means lots of stimulation building up huge volumes You can't do 30 sets a week if you train once a week unless you have a workout in which you do Scott can you imagine workout in which you do 30 sets in one session each of triceps biceps and forearms Yeah, you can write that number down in your app but I'm really working hard after I don't know eight sets or ten sets or something However, if you train triceps biceps and forearms Monday Wednesday Friday It's just enough time between each workout for you to heal and you can crank some volume So you can do ten sets each time eventually. That's 30 sets per week for each muscle that is a really really big deal And this allows you also to be arrested enough so you're not just going through the motions, but you can make every workout grand grand baby See Yeah Scott is a possible to do 20's guy impression without the the bird slash Dame also coming in and saying something to support her man Her two cents and at the old bag the old bag you old bat Yeah, yeah, body and Clyde. See wait wait wait wait wait Yeah, see I'm done. I swear to God. I does this channel exist. Why do I exist? Scott of your thought that why are you a person and why isn't someone better than you and your spot Yeah, every morning noon and night Exercises. I'm not really personality about this You train for a while you're going to figure out what exercises work best for you. There are some recommendations Ideally tension at the lengthened position should be really high. Skull crushers lying curls stuff like that But what really matters is the overall high stimulus to fatigue ratio and Exercises that you like so you should be able to get exercises that feel really tense in the target muscle If you do incurles and people like where do you feel them like I don't know my elbows not a good sign You should have exercises that towards the end of high repsets you have a really Narlie burn in the target muscle. That's good Exercises that for not so many sets give you a Narlie pump and at the same time They should be exercised as you don't hate doing and that your joints feel pretty good with for weeks on end That's functionally more or less the stimulus to fatigue ratio Heuristically calculated and that means that if you have those exercises just this really really awesome Exercises you can do them for weeks and weeks and weeks on end at a little bit of weight out a few repetitions each time and really build some momentum Whereas if you have exercise that you hate they hurt your joints They can't let you load a really heavy you can't go to failure really a ton It's not really good and that's no no good at all now Technique good technique is a standard when you're doing bicep curls using your biceps Not your lower back not your lutes, et cetera. I'm even saying anything more about that because that's a good known thing that everyone should know by now Don't but Can only hope What I want you to do for this Monday once they Friday and we'll build out a sample version of this program Just a second you can go catch that on the RPA perch via but You just want to choose three total exercises three exercises for triceps three for biceps and three for forearms And you're gonna run them Monday Wednesday and Friday for the first exercise you're gonna pick an exercise that you can go pretty heavy with Sets of five to 10-ish reps even as high as 15 is totally fine Something like barbell skull crushers something like You know barbell or cable curls for forearm something like like one arm off the bench curls or something like that something you can handle with some really really good For the second exercise for that Wednesday exercise for all of them you're gonna pick an exercise you can do in the 10-to-20 Rep range which is most exercises so just pick something you like In the last exercise for Friday for biceps for triceps bicep and forearms You're gonna pick an exercise that is really really comfy to do while comfy here is relative for sets of 20 to 25 Even 30 reps a very high rep effort. We're gonna hit every single type of of rep range through this whole week heavy on Monday moderate Wednesday lighter on Friday and when you go Put your weights into the hypertrophy app you're gonna make sure that you're putting the weights in appropriately and choose Nexides for you. So for example if you have an exercise like OG was Standing barbell curl Sets of 30 your backs gonna give out before your arms will And so if you can do like lying down on a bench cable curls that's probably better for that regard If you're trying to do jam presses for skull crushers By the time you get to 20 reps your pecs and shoulders are gonna give out your triceps are gonna be like this is dumb But if you're doing cable push downs, yes, that's a 20 to 30 or totally fine So typically you're gonna choose exercises that are more controlled more machine-based Require less of your body posture to be maintained for higher reps and exercises that are safe But allow you to produce really really high tensions for sets of 5 to 10 effort 10 to 20 it's really cart Blanche. It's really whatever you like and We are gonna make sure To also focus so that's that's the exercise selection part very straightforward For relative effort Start each muscle cycle week one at oh three or four reps in reserve You know when it starts to get pretty tough few reps into that stop right your reps down on your app And then at the end of each mess of cycle you should be going to zero reps in reserve Which is like you finished the last rep barely and you know you're not gonna get another one You put it down or true failure which is you try that last rep it doesn't go anywhere you put the dumbbell down You're like no nobody noticed that I'm weak and Fallible and then you write down your reps that's the goal How you're gonna progress with that we're gonna talk about in a sec But you start a little bit on the easy side and and very very much on the hard side arms Don't tend to be very strong like your biceps and triceps and forearms I'm gonna lift like the kind of weights your chest and back and legs would lift So the systemic confetti component is relatively low which means If you think you're like a little bit not pushing hard enough in a set push harder Really burn the arms in if you start a mesocycle and you're actually at two or three RIR versus three or four Best totally fine for arms if you do that for quads you're gonna be paying that on the back end for arms You're just gonna gut it out you'll be totally fine volume My recommendation is not look do not just do this if you have been training for a while make sure you're pretty well trained at least a few months of like good training under your belt Then I mean a few months recently lifetime wise probably years Start with about 12 weekly sets so when you make your program You're gonna go in and the app sort of kicks out how many sets you have to do of everything you just hit like the little function button And you just plus add a set and you add another set and however many sets you add through that session and through the week That's how many sets the app's gonna start you add after that It's all regulations are gonna kick in and take care of everything So start with something like 12 weekly sets and go up to something like 21 sets per muscle per week In the first month of cycle, which means what it means you're gonna do Monday once they Friday For tri steps for example and biceps and forms works the same way you're gonna start with four sets Monday four sets Wednesday four sets Friday in that first week in the second week you might move up to five In the third week you move move to six in the fourth week maybe the last week depending on how you do things You might move up to something like seven now at the end of the day auto regulation is Gonna take care of all this for you if you use the app Okay, so if you use the app you fill out how sore you are how tired you are be brave But be honest and then the apps like that like if you tell me you're like healing very much on time and actually a little early You're not sore and you come back for your sessions and your performance is good And you feel like it ought to rule over around with volume then yeah, it's just gonna kick you more sets and it's gonna do this part automatically However, if you're not using the app or if the app's kind of babying you and you might not be filling it out Like exactly super honestly like, oh, I feel like I'm overwhelmed But I know it shouldn't be I know I can still do this then just manually add the sets in the app will let you do that If you're not using the app just just do four five six seven seven D load Now seven sets of triceps is a lot of triceps with one exercise mind you so you can do Some tricks you can use what's called myaret matching So you'll say you have skull crushers and you have five sets of skull crushers What you can do is do four sets of skull crushers Instead or maybe even three but that first set you'll see you get 18 reps The next set you do my reps which means you do as many reps as you can and You know get to whatever RR for that week. Let's say one RR Rack rest five or ten seconds hit that set again and do as many reps as it takes to get close to failure again Rack you do as many of those as it takes to match that first set so 18 on the first set 18 on the second Now if you rest about a minute minute and half between sets which should probably be doing you're going to only be able to get like 10 or 12 on that second one So you're going to have to do another mini set to get to fit a 18 reps and then a third set you're going to go for 18 reps again and it might take three mini sets to get there Did you notice you're doing a some total of as many reps as you would over five sets As many approaches to failure as you would over five sets But only in three sets because you take little mini rest breaks and crank out more reps when you're tired That can allow you to save some time in the gym and it will get you pretty much the identical results And it's really fun though it is very painful so you have to understand something if you want to save time in the gym You're going to have to crank up on some other variable and that variable just happens to be discomfort If you're good with that I do it all the time. It's totally fun. It's awesome Plus it gets you one hell of a nirally arm pump Which is super dope so you don't actually have to do like straight sets with three minutes rest seven and sets of tri-subskis Don't worry this this volume is going to go up in the late and as a cycle My right match system is actually really really good way to go about this That's the first mezzo we start at roughly 12 we go to 21 the second mezzo Start at roughly 16 ish 15 or something like that so five sets of everything and And at 25 sets or so if you can recover On the third mezzo you're going to start more like 20 or 21 like you're starting at seven sets in that first week The dealodes come in really handy and you go up to something like oh, I don't know 30 sets at the end And so that means 10 sets of tri-subs in that workout 10 sets of biceps the myra match thing I would say converts to about two thirds Right, so if you're doing 10 sets of biceps, but you do myra match instead you want to do like six or seven myra match sets Scott you ever done six myra match sets of biceps? Ooh, I don't think I have yeah, you'd have bigger arms if you did mother Four almost kills you so this is guys. This is a very intense program again Auto regulation has to be the cap if you come in for Wednesday and you're still violently sore and ultra tired from Monday Don't go to seven sets just stay at five your body will be the guide But if you're one of these people that just kind of recovers you know, I don't know Technically I could do more just follow this trajectory. It's gonna be brutal But it's one percent gonna go around so basically kind of start at 12 go to like just over 20 We start at like 15-ish and we go into the mid 20s then we start at like 20-ish and we go all the way up to 30 that Template three mezzo cycles in a row which is about four months total of training for most people You guys If you either try your hardest and get close to those volumes, but not quite Or if you actually do those volumes you're gonna grow 97 times out of 100 and the three times it's just like now I don't know I'm like oh a PhD in shit in this but a good luck That's the thing Progressions every single week of this program You are going to either add a repetition to each set or You are gonna add something like two and a half pounds to each set if possible five is okay But a little aggressive if you're adding five maybe try adding five every other week. That's probably good And that's it that's all you change on progression slow and steady wins the race as long as your volume is high And your reps and reserve are pretty low close to failure and high volume Then the progression should be smooth and easy This whole thing of like man feel pretty good today bro Let's sort of the plate on the bicep curl that is not a thing that that get you hurt But it will not get you any more jack now here's the thing you can get stronger faster by adding more rate to the bar And you can tell people how strong you are at the club as they look at your small arms with incredulity in their face Scott That meme of the guy yelling into the girls ear. I figured it out He has small arms and I think he's telling her his really impressive curl PR that guy Is literally yelling I know it doesn't look like my arms are so big But believe it or not that I actually curl more than a lot of I Phoebe pros in my gym and she's not having it because no one gives a shit How strong your arms are are you an arm wrestler if you are check out our Devon Laira video. It's awesome and also like a Cool But you don't have to brag because you're a real arm wrestler and then people find out your arm wrestler at the club Like you want our muscle and you're like now come on. We're just having fun the c'mon, man There's table and you're like all right and you do a spiral fracture to their Both of their arm upper arm lower arm bones and then send them running don't you ever For me ever big we out here I'm saying say that after it always helps so if you want size these slow Many progressions are the way to do it. You're not there to train your ego you're there to train your arms Duration I recommend for ascending weeks of volumes loads and one d-load week retrain Very very easy the apple take care of all that for you. We have tons of videos on d-loading check one of those How and you're gonna repeat this three times after that you will be two things sick and tired of training arms And have much more jackdarm the perfect combination of course now Each mesocycle do you still use the same exercise? I have an idea about this that works pretty well Whatever exercise feels good You get good pumps your progressions are moving along really well your joints feel okay You love the exercise keep it so if skull crushers work really well in the first meso Great in the second meso if you feel great in the second meso, good do it again for a third If an exercise feels bad Consistently shit pumps your progressions are like I'm not getting stronger on this. I might be getting weaker Your joints are like not and you hate doing it then just replace it with another exercise So if your last weeks or your first mesocycles Monday and Friday were like awesome exercises Just use them in the next meso number two But for Wednesday if it was total shit you're like I should have never picked this machine I hate this machine I think it is only cranks my elbows and it doesn't even train my biceps Just completely replace that as a matter of fact If you're more advanced liftor after about one or two weeks if you know it's a shit exercise just replace it then But if you're like have sex just as fine, but it wasn't great and I haven't exercise in mind that I've used before that I love Click it right in this is a specialization program. It's not forever and so you kind of want You want to put your best foot forward you want to like you know have your have your best warriors Scott, you know all those martial arts movies from the 80s where the guys have to fight like incrementally stronger people to get to the final boss Like just get the final boss out in front, you know what I'm saying? Like you know we don't need to work up to shit Also, you know No one really has guns in those movies, huh I guess not But the gun really like it really solves a lot of problems Also like man Scott you've seen the John Wick movies, right? Yeah So when he fights like one or two dudes at a time in a completely cleared space with 10 lines of sight Outside shots and there's 90 people with guns around and no one just picks him off You gotta suspend some disbelief Mike. It's a movie. Did you say some or all These I guess he's fighting people who are like blind Yeah, it's just don't know where to shoot But they go by smell and they can tell where the fight is. I don't know all right That's basically the structure you guys I'm gonna go laptop going it's got the video guys laptop. I have to close like 80 porn tabs It's all transport Really could be my laptop We'll build the app Work out and then we'll talk about a few kind of intricacies of how to use it and then we'll be good to go Scott 321 laptop all right guys. So I've got the template the plan a new mesocycle builder here I've made five days Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and when I'm gonna do first It's kind of get the just grunt work out of the way and go to Tuesday and I am going to do chest one exercise back one exercise and I'm going to do shoulders when exercise quad hands and why not I guess calves Remember most compound quad training change your glutes enough for maintenance so you're good to go and then I'm going to create exercise slots for Thursday and just kind of flip the script so we'll start with calves We will go to hamstrings we will go to quads and then shoulders back and chest Tuesday Thursday's the other way now it's time for the meat and potatoes and so what we're going to do is here in this part I'm just going to pick a triceps movement and then a biceps movement and then a form movement guys in this demo I'm not going to actually select the exercises for two reasons one I already explained how to pick exercises you guys know what the you're doing two I do like to talk about what exercises it worked for me and I like and as I far and all that stuff but sometimes I don't like to do it too much because I think some people with all do respect all do good assumptions here they kind of think like ah aha Smith machine skull crushers was really what's going to get me jacked it's like no it's just like an exercise I like so I'm really trying to keep this open and guys fundamentally if the exercise feels good it gets you a good pump it just kind of doesn't matter much which one you pick pick your favorites so we have this now there are two ways to go about this this is important for very good program symmetry if you really have a lot of OCD what you can do is for Wednesday and Friday flip the order so what I can do is Wednesday I can go and go hit biceps then forms and then I'm going to hit triceps at the very end and then for Friday what I can also do is go instead and start with forms and then hit my triceps and then hit my biceps so with that allows us to do is every single muscle gets its time in the sun to be first and second and third and there's nothing wrong with that I think that's great that being said if I have a really big bicep pump I actually can't get as much range of motion as I would like on triceps because my biceps in the way when I have a form pump bicep training is kind of pointless because your forms give out early and even on push downs and stuff having a form pump distracts you from tricep training but having a really pump triceps and really pump biceps doesn't really just track from forums so might prefer way of doing this and I'm going to change this in the actual template that you guys will be able to access is really just to do triceps first for all these days biceps second for all of these days and finishing all these days of forms and let's be on as fellas like finishing a workout with forms is just like get the work done you're already pumped you are to go cheat it's cool finishing a workout with triceps is like the triceps are hard to train bro big range of motion bigger weights a lot of my muscle connection and and especially with pump forms it's weird so can you do it in any way you like as long as you have biceps triceps and forms in the day Monday once you're Friday somewhere yes but what I'm going to do and make this template by just flipping the orders around and it's always going to be triceps then biceps then forms if you try this try and it looks like oh shit my triceps got mega jacked my biceps got a little bit bigger my forums hardly budget at all because I was always tired training them it's very unlikely if that happens next time you run this arm specialization phase for you know three mesocycles in a row flip the script and start with biceps or flip the script and start with forms or do that whole thing where you rotate them all the same time so that's really kind of it you guys that is the whole situation when you actually access this template you want to fill in all of your favorite exercises well you can also do is you can just click this magic auto for electric sizes button and then like if it picks cool exercises great if you disagree you can change them so actually like I don't want to hit this because then it's going to save it into the template but if you hit this it just fills in random exercises with all of your stuff which is totally good to go and so now that we have this you guys can access this exact workout and change it anyway you like to fit your needs because in the template you can move anything around that you want and it's going to be when you get their iPad per tri-fayette it's going to be in the mail five days per week section and it's going to be called big arms now do you want big arms now link in description big arms in your future I'll see you guys next time with bigger arms
