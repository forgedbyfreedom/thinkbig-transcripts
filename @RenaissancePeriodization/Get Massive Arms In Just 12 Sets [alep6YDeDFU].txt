You got this, but put it down. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Up, yes, up, up. Try the way down, man. Go, slow, slow. The slow. The slow. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Folks, I used to be doctor-by. Then I decided, after that, I would swear, but I can't. I'm chilling now. I took 18 zannies. Your boy's comfy in this hoodie. I bought him from Jared. Jared, thanks for your great zannie dealer. He's a your white trash roots. This is Conan. Yes, he is a barbarian, but he is also a few things. He is of many different nations and peoples and speaks no fewer than 9,000 languages. How many is it actually? 5,000 languages. 5,000 languages. 5,000. That's a lot. In any case, he is also a comedian. And he happens to be an IFBB-Zik-Close. That's it. And he's going to keep second two. The original, he competes against Jared, whether they're going to start hitting each other in the face pretty shortly. But before that, Conan's got to do a cosmetic thing called Get Big Arms. We're going to train his arms. They're already huge. He's contest-diting. He's law-on-energy. He says, let's see if we can get some less going at his expense right now. Our handy-dandy RP training app beta says that we have dumbbell-scall crushers first. I program them in myself. We're going to be doing three sets here very likely. 15 to 20 reps. Nice and light starting out. Conan is contest prep. We've got to start on nice light to get some heat going through the joints and then we'll go on to heavier stuff later. Not ideal for most of you folks training, but in contest prep, weird stuff has to happen. We're going to give you a ton, hopefully, of a really good cues for this exercise. dumbbell-scall crushers, let's get it done. And up, and one more, slow, keep them in and up. Very good, rack. He's already heavy. I would think he's pretty close to failure. So don't worry about the rep counts too much. Just really focus on quality reps. Get deep as possible. As it gets harder, you're kind of stopping really high. Keep your head back. That's a feeling like this. It's the... It's the... It's the great thing. You said you'd mostly cable, but I assume that we do a lot of press downs in the shed. So you probably used to this horizontal type of tries to make your shots. Really just hit an entirely different head of the triceps. I do just like all the same. I have to say cable and... Okay, a little bit more. Up. 11 elbows in. Yes. It's going to be hard. Up. 12 down. Slow, control. Up. Couple more. 13. Let's get 15. Slow. Right away and going. Up. Elbows in and the way down. Last one. Good one. Let's go. Come on, man. Slow. Right away and... Up. Go. Go. Rack. Good. Good. Good. Stop. Very good. It's just like... I'm not used to it. Sure. Yeah. But that's a good thing. Sure. This is my mood. Beyond comfortable. Well, here you go. I'm getting on comfortable. Okay. Elbows in close together the whole time. Yes, just like that. Now hit it. But not straight. Like... So elbows together. Yeah. Not turned not at all. Right here is good. It's easy for the dumbbell skull crusher to start flaring out a ton, cutting a range of motion. It's imperative that you try to bring your elbows close together. Especially on the way down. If you come out, you're still using try steps lot, but it's also more pecks. You want to make it more try specific by keeping your close and lock. And you really want to get into this rhythmic pattern where your elbows are outside of the equation. They're locked right in place. And then only movement occurs about the joint that it's supposed to be. Slow controlled on the way down. Good pause here for Conan. And a nice powerful extension. No wiggling, no weaving. Just the right stuff. 10, two more. You've got this. Slow. Up. Again. Slow. Put a troll. Elbows in. Up. Go. Go. Go. Brake. Good shit. Oh, nice serious. Oh yeah, good. Good. Very good. It's one of the different than when you do like a push-down, right? Yeah. We'll different. So I would say it probably smart to include some sort of vertical tries to exercise. Like whether that's a push-down or an overhead variation. And then also some form of a skull crusher. So if you start implementing that, you can probably see that your tries to get a lot thicker. Yeah. You like I said it's a good part of your tongue. That's a cable like school crush. It's standing next to you. Yeah. But this is a good. Yeah. Probably a good variation like something like this. I'm really good. Next exercise. If you guys didn't hear, we just had a low conversation about how he can potentially split up his volume in the future. So we were going to do two horizontal exercises for the triceps. The next one was going to be an inverted skull. And said I'm going to show him kind of how he can make that modification to a horizontal plus a vertical tricep exercise. Hitting different heads of the tricep or at least emphasizing them with different exercises. So the next exercise will, since this is horizontal, it's going to be a more vertical emphasis. We're going to do push-shounds with my reps. So I don't think he's done any sort of rest falls my reps recently. But he is one used to cables oftentimes for his triceps, which he just told us. And I don't want this entire workout because he is three weeks out from a show. I don't want the whole thing to be some sort of novel stimulus and just fuck him up and really interfere with his training. Again, three weeks out. He's been doing a lot of cable shit. So instead of just making everything different, we're going to go ahead do some my rep press with the press down that he's normally been doing throughout his last training block. And then just that the second area, what we're showing you is his alternating from the horizontal to a vertical tricep. Seven slow on the way up, slow. I hope that stretch for a second. Then down. And you can give a close to your body. That's the body, that's the body. There you go. Nine. Elbows back. You know, fight those elbows back. I know it hurts like no. Slow. Like, fight it back. Big push. Little. 11. Slow. One more. Big push. Slow. And then you're going to do another. There. There. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. What's my. It's like a rest. Pause. So the first set you'll get what you get. And the rest of the set you're trying to match that. But you're obviously going to be really fatigued. So you're probably failed before whatever it is. It's a say 15. So let's see you get 12. You'll pause for like five seconds. You two more. Pause. Do another one. Just like a rest. Just like a rest. There you go. Put the body. Put the body. Push. Push. Good. Or is that the second? Rast the second? We have four more. We're sitting in. Futter in. Futter in. Three. One more. Chest up. Come on. Slow. Slow. Good. Very good. Three done with all of these. Want you to back up over here. Put your feet over there. And you're going to do push-ups. But here's the deal. Put your hands right here. Just outside of your chest. Come all the way down until your chest touches the ground. Go all the way up until you're completely locked out. That's a push-up, right? Okay. You're hip-stay nice and high. All arms. When you're done and you can't do this anymore. Come down to your knees and do push-ups off from here. Nice. Sounds good. We'll let you know when to do both. Two. Go to the body. I know it's fucking hard. But don't sacrifice technique. Three. That was great. Slow. I should close to the body. Slow. Go. Go. Go. If you're not going to do another slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, I was that slow-resist. Resist. Resist. Don't rack. Boss. Wait. Rack. All right. Three. You get that butt up. It'll be hard. Four. Slow. Up. Five. Again, Conan. Let's go. Up. Go to six. One more. God damn it. Slow. Go. Go to six. One more. Slow. Up. Up. Up. Go. Go. Rest a bit. Rest. Six. Sorry. Six. Three. Good God. And up again. Four. One last one. Slow. Slow. Wait. Up. Up. Go. Go. Get that shit. Rack. Good. Stop. Whoa. I don't remember when I did last time. Push-ups. Feeling good? Five sub times. Yeah. All right. I think we don't go away. Show me that shit. This is good. You see. Feel a sound pump. Very good. I can barely move my arm. Thank you. Keep your hands up. Feet close together. Come all the way down for the stretch. Hold. Slow. Hold. Slow. Just like that. Try-seps are over. Throwing in a try-seps are super pumped. Now we move to Biceps. Two exercises here. The first one being inclined dumbbell curls. You want to do is make sure that you're chest is pointed up. You set the incline just enough to give your real deep stretch in the biceps at the bottom. Come up nice and quick and athleticly. I would recommend pausing at the top. Just to make sure you can have a stable starting place for that slow, eccentric. You'll notice we want to come up quick. But control the way down. It gives us all the benefits of muscle growth. And the resultant happiness and connectivity with the rest of your community. Big biceps. You can run out. Grab a hug the dog, hug a rat the sewer, hug yourself. It's all too slow. Slowly. Yep. Three. Slow. Slow. Down slow. Good. Good. Shit. Holy fuck. Now we're talking. Now we're talking. Don't tell me it's burning. I'm not your guy to college. Boom. Slow. Last one. Come on. Squeeze up. Slow. Slow. The slowest. The slowest. All the way down. Right it out. Oh shit. Yeah. Ooh. That's one set. Coin unquote. One set. Six. Slow. One pain. One more. One more. You're here for the pain man. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. I was a breath. Very good. That's seven. And she can show all the way down. Three. Slow. Nice and slow. Slow. Leat the rep. Do not. Slow. Rast. Rast. Wait. Do one more real quick. And then we'll do two. One more right now. Say it up. Chast up. Go. Yes. Slow. Full rev cone in. All the way down. Fuck. Yeah. Rast it up and then two. You're doing great. Slow. Slow. Strong. Up. Yes. And then slow as ever. Control. Control. Control. Control. Go. Go. Go. Holy shit man. Yeah. I don't work. You got a little pop going on. You got a little pop going on. I don't know. Fuck it on the huge. Fuck. Right. I got a little pop. Yeah. Yeah. It's all fat there guys. Pure body fat. You're like a sumo wrestler or some shit. Right. Right. Folks. End of the arm. Work out. We're in the awesome lighting room. Here at Fit Club. Turn the lights on. We're going to see. How ridiculous. Connicking look. We have Easy Bar. Bicep curls. We're going to do three sets. And yes, they will be my right match. Which means whatever he gets on the first set. He's going to have to make the same reps on the second and third. Getting as many mini sets as he can to get the job done. Pain is coming. He doesn't have anybody fat left either. So no hope for him. Let's get it done. 12. Slow. Couple. You got this. You got this. You got this. Don't put it down. Let's go. Go go go go go go go go go go go go. Up. Yes. Up. And just on the way down. Slow. Slowly. Slow down. That's it. Rack. Excellent. Lucky number 13 again. Amen. Six or seven.

Slow. Slow. All the way down. Rack. Three sounds like such a small number with. Yeah. Today's workout will be six total sets of biceps. Yeah. It's just like. Whoa. Good. Good. Yeah. The pump is good. How's the, so like similar to your session? You do how many such use like 30? Yeah. I'm trying to send biceps together. Yeah. It's just pretty compatible. I do just a lot of different angles. You know? It's just like a pretty comparable pump to what you normally get. Yeah. I would say it's a bit better. A little better. Well. One. Wait a control it. Great. Two. Slow. Slow. Slow. Last one. All the way up. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. And then super slow. Super slow. It's not good. Super slow. Don't let me take it. Don't let me take it. Don't let me take it. Don't let me take it. Don't let me take it. That's it. Good stuff, dude. I'm just done. Good work. Dude. All I did was yell. So thoughts? That's good. The pump is real. Excellent. Yeah. Good. Excellent. My honest. Your, uh, these are all new techniques to you. But within a set you really caught on. You never rush the centric. You finish the reps. Amazing work. Very impressive. Uh, it's like you're a professional at this. You're a professional bodybuilder. I still maybe do some shows. Was even a little bit. You can even have shows. Or by a train one. It's really fun. Jared, what do you think? Impressive for a bodybuilder, honestly. Impressive for a bodybuilder because a lot of my fuckers do this kind of shit. Yeah. That was really good man. Folks. There are barbarians. And there are civilized men. Conan is an ex of both. And an excellent person. And this was a phenomenal workout. If you want big arms, Jesus, do whatever. Fuck he's doing. Holy shit. Well, that'll sign us off so you guys next time.
