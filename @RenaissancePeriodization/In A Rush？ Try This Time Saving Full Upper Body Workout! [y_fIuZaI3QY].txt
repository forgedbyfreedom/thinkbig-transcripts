Let's see what's left in those arms. I can't even like feel my hand honestly. I'm serious in the left hand, like, can't hear over our minds. Left hands are overrated. Me, I'm Dr. Mike Franason's predization. This is I.P. Pro, Jared Feather and Boise Hanson. Let's just take a minute to appreciate our handsome Jared as... Jared, you will love yourself. I'm not sure. Don't stick your knife. He's years ago. He failed and never. This is Brian. That's right. Only Brian. He is an only-fans producer, mogul, multi-millionaire, no joke for real for real. Not like me. I get paid and Nick Shaw promissory notes. Don't know what they mean, but Nick says, hey, here you go. This man is top of his game, entrepreneur. Also, in a few adult productions himself, I might add. Wow, they're fine. Good enough for my end, but... Please. Look at him. In any case, I actually tried to audition for an adult film once they left it me until I just left. It wasn't even saying anything. I would've accepted. Thank you so much. Yeah, I got you. In any case, this is a busy man. Legit, he runs a team of a ton of people who create content. We do the back end stuff. He is a multi-millionaire. He's trying to make more of that money. He does not have time for a normal, sit down and wait for four minutes between sets of work out. So, Gen and I are going to take him through a gentle ginger. No way they said that wrong. Insanely difficult. Total. Upper body workout. We're going to do back. We're going to do shoulders. We're going to do arms with minimum rest between compound alternating supersets. Holy crap. Let's get going. Also. You didn't always use to look like this. You were quite shapely and quite man-esque. But how do I say this in a politically correct manner before you used to be? Fucking fat. Wow. I didn't say it. I love it. He said it. We've already stopped that much. Something about fat people. I'm not even a little jaren. How dare you? We love everyone on this channel. We love you. And we would have loved you before. You're about to get toasted with the upper body workout. Three, two, one, go. Let's go. Let's take a look. All right. We said the first exercise is going to be a superset of pull ups with dips. Muscles that are involved in both our minimum. So while the pulling muscles are resting after the pull ups, the dip muscles are working and vice versa. We're going to take about zero rest between pull ups and dips. After dips, we take 30 seconds rest just to get a little bit of air back. And then we hit it again. And again, three or four sets. We'll see how that goes. Amazing time-faving technique. But hold out. Why while I'm talking is my head smaller and off to the side. And brine being warmed up by Jared for lap pull nouns and for dips. Why don't we just get into it? Because your body weight weighs a lot. And it's always going to be even on bodyweight stuff to warm it up first. Now that he's going to be ultra warm, we're going to get right into it. And the pain begins and up. Perfect. That's it. All right. Wiggle it out. Relax a little bit. Think of happy feelings. And then we will begin the superset. So we're going to have you do as many of those pull ups as you can. Let's go to technique. As many dips as you can. We're going to let you rest about 30 seconds. And then we will repeat the process several times. Until you have begged us to stop. Please, I want to hear you say, Mike and Jared. And then when I hear that, I'll say that's Dr. Mike Keeam of the fucker. We do not count reps. We only count quality. Beautiful. Perfect. Perfect. Oh, yeah. It's called more all fucking day. Yes. Full stretch. We can control that. Show. Nice one here. That's it. That's it. Couple more. Slow. Good. Little deeper. You got this. We're here to make it hard. More. But you heard that before. Slow. Good. Good. Good. Good. Wow. Wow. Zero technique breakdown. 30 seconds. Feeling okay. All right. So far. Not like a Viagra pillar or a Dick injection or something. I don't know how you people work in our dorm. Not just make your face feel flush. All right. Go. Oh shit. One more. Let's go. All the way. Come on. Control the way down. Good. Push your unlock your feet. Unlock your feet for me. Push on me and go. Control. Push back and go. One more. Control. Push. Push. Control. Unwrap. Ooh. To the dims. I'm out by yourself. It's just so immasculating. Keep going. It's the most efficient amount of my life. Keep going. One more. Control. Push if you need to. Good. Good. Stop. I should have pushed a little more. You can't. You can't. You can't. You can't. You fucking quit. Yeah, it's finished. I want to. Oh. My man. Ah. Go. Come on. Offer two guys. One more. Bonus round. Slow control. One more. Yes. Oh. I have to tell you. Ooh. Assisted repetitions. You can do them in some situations. Make sure you're kind of improperly. If you have a log book, you count the ones you did and the ones you got assistance with. It's not always the right thing, but if you want more volume before, if you don't have an assisted pull up or a different machine, it's a way to make sure that the individual dust more up to. So we're trying to get at least five here per set. He's pretty beat up already. So I'm going to come in and let him do his many reps. He can't own and then get in there. He's going to be pushing back with his feet to extend himself. He's going to be using his legs against my frame. Help as much as possible. It's actually quite easy for me because he's just extending his legs. I just pulled right here. He puts his legs here. I don't have to physically lift him up. The partner shouldn't be lifting you. You use your partner as a frame to lift yourself up. Speaking of which, what was it what we're doing? We're going to the twig more steps. One more. Slow, deep, press up. Press. We beat that ass. We beat that ass. Wait, my mother. My mother's safe. That was awesome. Let's go do the next thing. Now, it's Brian's turn to do some chest pressing on the machine. Super set with some rolling on the machine as well. We're using the Matrix equipment here at Dragon's Lair. It's honestly fucking really good. It costs a could trillion by others' sum shit. It's got a computer in it. But it is awesome. The force curves are great. The smoothness is great. I love everything about it. He's going to be doing sets of 10 to 20 on the chest press. It sets a 10 to 20 on the roll. This is a combination of essentially resistance training work with kind of some cardio work in as well because of the speed of transition. We do both. We rest 30 seconds. We do both again. You're going to see a lot of load adjustment. It's not just one load the entire time. You will be getting tired. The machines allow us the ability to have the stability component taken care of. So you can just crank it also. The loading that we can choose to make it easier and easier. Loading wise like lighter is a better term. So that you can get enough repetitions every time to cause a lot of disruption to the muscle and also burn lots of calories to get his entrepreneur work out knowing that's even really a thing. Alright, let's get to the workout. Good. Go, go, go, go, go, go. That's it. Excellent. Right over into the row. Strap in. Right away. Right away. Right away. Crunch. Oh, yes. Two more. Full range. Good. Last one. Coming up. Big pull. Yes. Slow. As if you're going to do another. Let go. Perfect. Take 30 seconds. We're right back on the chest pass. Yes. Lock this one out. Let's go. Big push. Full lock out. Yes. Again. Slow control. We're here for pain. Come on. Push it. Push it. Good. Switch right over. Quickly, Rhodes. No time to rest. One more. Slow. And. Rack. Big lock out. Yes. Chest up. Slow control. You're in charge. Big push. Good. Couple more. Guys turn me on with that. Let's go, man. So, arcs. Fuckin' weirdo. Let's go. Big push. Good. Again. Chest up. Chest up. Let's go. Let's go to daddy. Good. Slow. Slow control. Push. Push. Push. Push. Slow. As if you're going to do another. And that's a good right into the back machine. Right into the back machine. No rest. No rest. No rest. Go, go, go, go. The phone is round. All day. Good. Look forward. There's nothing to see around there. Good. God has all the way up. Let's finish all the way up. One good wrap left. Yes. And then slow. As if another. Rack. Do. Good. Good. Good. Stop. Dumbbell upright road to dumbbell shoulder press. Seated dumbbell shoulder press. So upright road standing. Sit down and sit. Yep. Upright rows with the dumbbells. Up fast. Pause at the top. And a slow concentric. We're starting slowly centric on the right now. As soon as you've had enough of those. Try not to trip over. You will sit down into the seat. Feed up. Chest up. Touch the dumbbells. All the way to your shoulders. And go all the way to a lockout. Sit down. Doing dumbbell presses. We're supersending upright rows. Just seated dumbbell press. One. Get up. Two. That's the last one. Up high. Three. Amazing. Sit down. One. One. Get up. Two. That's the last one. Up high. Three. Amazing. Sit down. Start with the dumbbells. Touching your shoulders. And blast them up. Go. And go that. Good. Rest. Go. Go. Go. Go. Lock it. Slow. Wait. Wait for it. Don't blow anywhere. Shoulders back up. Dumb those up in the shoulders. Rest there for a second. Press. Yes. One more. Rest for a bit. Press. Yes. Slow. There's dumbbells from you. Switch to something lighter. Do an accent. Three. Right here. The fucking mat. Up and hold. Four. Yes. And what bonus round? Hell yeah. Good. One more now. One more. Oh, that one. That was good. Have a seat. We're going to be here until you do 10 of these total. And let's knock out three or four right away. And then rest with them on your shoulders. All right. Boom. Slow. Control. Up. Slow. Control. One more. Up. Slow. Control. Rest for a second. Last one and done. Go. Lock it. Lock it out. Slow. That's it. That's it. Let's go finish your arms off. It's time to finish this workout with arms. Of course arms. How are we going to let someone get out of an upper body workout without pumped up arms? You finish off your arms. You walk by the girl who works with a front desk and you're like, hey, listen lady. She's like, I'm going to cut you off. Give me your number. Let's go have consensual sex right now. That's ideal at how it works. Anything down from there will still take. Three sets. Cable curls. Supercetic of push downs. The rest of the ryan's upper body gets torched. This is straightforward again. Tired. Pist. Pumped. Frustrated. I want to be out of here. Still good technique every single rep. The great thing about cables is you're going to reduce load every time to stay in that 10 to 20 rep range. Let's get it done. Good. There. More bar and you got this. Big curl. Hold on. I'm going to turn each other. I was in totally chill. One more. Yeah, let's go. Come on. Come on. Good technique. Oh shit. Another one, man. You got some brass. Yeah. Yeah. Buck yeah. Good. One more. All the way up. Move. That's it. Rack. Push downs time. Right away. Right into it. Notice we're kind of swapping. If this is around. We did a pull first. Didn't push. Didn't push first. Then a pull. That's one way you can do these. You're going to be able to emphasize anything directly. So like if you want to bigger back. But this is all you can do. Probably the best time to do an emphasis block in your training. So when you do any kind of antagonistic workout. Do one thing first in the next. So for this, we hit the hell out of the triceps with the pushing exercises and the upright rows and the military press. Super set. Whenever we do military press, those are a lot of tricep. The pushing exercise was a lot of tricep. We haven't really done too much biceps. So we're going to do biceps first here intentionally. That way he's not too close to do a bunch of reps because if you try to do, you guys have seen me do it on the channel. If you're trying to do a bunch of curls after a push down, probably not going to happen. So biceps first, the triceps have gotten hit pretty well. And then triceps to finish up. Push. Good. Again, slow. No breaks. Push. That's it. And. Rack. Right over right into curls. Hit it. Three. Two more. Right. Let's go. Run. Oh shit. Yeah. All the way up to the lock. All the way up. Come on. All the way up. Oh, what was that? Do that again. Halfway through a quitting ball shed. Let's go. All the way up to the top. Go. You got two. One. Slow. Last one. All the way up. Two. Slow. Oh shit. Up. Slow. And. Rack. Good. Right into push. That's what's going to shut strong. Five. Good. One last one. Everything you've got. They with it. Lock it. Slow. Is it for another? There we go. Let's do it. Lock it. There we go. Yes. And. Rack. Ehh. Yeah. Oh. Good shit man. All right. Let's do it. Right away. Let's see what's left in those arms. I can't even like feel my hand honestly. I'm serious. My left hand like. From here over. All the way down. Chaps touches the ground. I'll be good. Good. All the way. Chaps to the ground. Come on man. One more. Slow. One more. Slow. One more. Slow. Control. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh yeah. That's it folks. Good job. That is it. The body has given up. Mmm. Got a pump. You can just stay right there. Stay right here. Watch standing assistance. We are about to assist in. Big little. I made them from me to work out on this kid. So I don't know. This is great entrepreneurship. I'll do for Newbridge. Listen. Go out there and be a CEO of your own shit. You feel me start small just to see you of you. And then maybe some other people get in the mix. And then all of a sudden you're multimillionaire. You know what I'm saying? Adult. Celebrity. Yeah. I want to say that. Something like that. Behind the scenes man. Yeah. The money man. See. Yeah. In any case. Originally, why the workout? Yeah. Good. I got to start working a little bit harder at home. I'm saying bagging. A lot of people say that after they train with that. Not acceptable. Well, you did excellent. Good luck using your arms the rest of the day. Yeah. And yeah. That's for real when I got. Wow. No bad. I hope nothing is the somewhere that you need in on a tall shelf or something like that. I'll just grab one of my teeth. There you go. Luckily you're of an adult height and you'll be just fine. Dude, thank you so much for coming on the channel. It's been a pleasure. It's been a pleasure. Beating you up. I'm TV. And folks, if you have any questions, comments, please leave them below. And see you next time.
