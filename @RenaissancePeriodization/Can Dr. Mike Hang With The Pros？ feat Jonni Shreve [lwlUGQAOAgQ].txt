Oh my, always filling up. But soft music is a style. Yo, YouTube, quick and tross. Me, I'm Dr. Mike. That there, my biological son, my firstborn, my child, my seed. Mr. I-F-B-Pro, Jared Feather. And we're joined today from Eastern Canada. If you believe that's a real place, I think it's still like Hogwarts. Mr. I-F-B-B-Pro, Johnny Shreve, V-U-Tube collab, you've been waiting for. You've been asking for, you've been begging for. He's here to show us how real pro trains legs. He's going to jump in for our leg workout. There will be pain. There will be suffering. And there will be an embracement of one's ancestral Nigerian god-like athlete genetics. I'm talking about myself, of course. Oh, and Johnny, what's up? How are you feeling? I feel good, man. Good. I'm excited. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. All right. Pain time? Pain time. Go. Every time you touch your butt with the bar, or close, that's good enough. And then a slow eccentric on the way down, and a full stretch at the bottom. Yep. The machine has to clank at the bottom, and touch the bottom every time. Big stretch on the ams. Yeah, there you go. When you do your set, the stretch at the bottom being controlled. Do you ever say both? Like so I touch your butt. What we like to do is make sure that we're hitting a standardized range of motion. And that means we have to physically feel the touch of the bottom, and feel the touch of the top, or at least get us close to the top as we can, until like, limb ratio wise, you're just unable to touch your own butt. That's totally cool. Yeah. So that's where we're coming from, but absolutely both. The concentric, I like explosive. The eccentric, I like controlled, to really milk it out. Yeah, I think that needlessly controlling that last bit of the concentric. It might take away from that part. Yeah. So it's probably best for like pretty forceful concentric. Yeah. And like you said, standardized range of motion. So that's where we try to tap the ass. Yeah. And you might come out of that kind of quickly, because you're not used to that position. Yeah. But as long as you try to control that switch from concentric to eccentric, it's a bit different. And let's get people more. Love and how yeah. There you go. 12. Goal mode. Come on. Let's go. Finish that llama. Low. Yeah. Zero. Not lineup. So go to like not bad, man. I count 12 good ones. Yeah, I could have just fit 150. Or a little less than one. I'm going to stick a 170 and hit all the 12 from now. What about the positive? We are going to be doing my orep match. My orep match. First set you go hard. Basically close to failure. This is my peak week. Jared's peak week as well. After your first set, you get normal rest. It's up to you to repeat that same sets reps. But you're allowed to take little rest breaks in the second set, third set and fourth set. So if you get 15 reps on a first set, on your second set, you get 13. That's a failure. You stop. You breathe five to ten seconds. You get another two. That's 15 again. Next time you get 10, then three, then two and so on. With normal rest breaks in between the big sets. But the little sets have a five to ten second rest break. I have like, we explained in the, I had you say the math. So basically, you're like first set to failure. Machines reps in rest boss. But I set a better. Trace leicin. Fuck a five. That's what I'm here. That's crazy. That's crazy. Yeah, how are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? Come on. You just won those athletic whites. It's rare, but it happens. It's got those hamstrings. 11. Take a time with this and I'm dressed it out a little bit. Touch. Low zero. Rest it out a bit finish out last wrap. This good stuff Johnny, do it great. Hit it up. Yes, slow control. And that's it. This shit. You look good. Good stop. It really hits. That's like going a failure a whole bunch. Right. Good shit, man. Oh, I mean, call that one. So you're going to do this. Oh, it's this. Why do you stuff like this? Yeah. So if you can, try to keep it in the hamstrings as much as possible. Yeah. Or just try to leave it there. Yeah. It'll go through a lot more in your hands. 100%. Yeah. Jared. But this is me. Johnny's our guest. Nice to be guests. You're doing great. You're doing everything perfect. What? We got it. Oh, I forgot that part. It's supposed to be a compliment first. Yeah. Yep. 10. Nice to be out. You're good. Feel a little more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Yeah. Yep. Let's go. Yeah, Johnny. Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah, Johnny. Hell yeah. Yeah. Let's go. Yeah, Johnny. Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ha. It's shit. Way better. Good stuff. Great thing. Taxquat time. Taxquat time. Taxquat time. 5 sets of hackswats. For me, three top sets heavy. Two downsets slightly lighter. Gonna warm up first. Good technique. We'll talk you guys through how everything is going to be. And then after that, we'll last set of hacks ends with a kind of a drop set of just bodyweight squats on the squatting wedge. We'll clue that in when we have to. Pain time. Now I'm going to kill me today. We're trying. I know. It's like the right to pass to just something. Yeah. See if there's bodybuilders like this dog shit. He's a meatheader. Good set up, Johnny. Deep and strict. Jantel pause. Still warming it up. Nice and easy. Oh yeah. So warming up for the hackswats. Warming up, especially for heavy leg stuff. You've got to take your time. Rushing it is a very, very bad idea. You could get hurt. And honestly, if you take your time warm up, the actual work sets feel better. Your technique feels better if you're stronger. All your weird nagon injuries are going to feel better because they're going to be warmer and more pliable. So you definitely don't want to rush this. The way I warm up for this is actually don't start hacksquadding until there's three plates on there. I know humble brag. But what I do is I warm up just 15 bodyweight squats. And since it's a completely vertical and I already weigh 250. When I get on the hacksquad, some of my weight is co-signed out trigonometry wise. And then three plates on there actually feels like the next jump from 250. So I'm going to get on there now and I'm going to do a set of eight and three plates. I'm going to do a set of four to six at five plates after that. And then I'm going to try doing my six plate and change for like two or three reps. And after that I'll be ready to go. So we're going to take Johnny through warm-up similarly and then we'll be good to go. Work set. Like this. Let's go. Come on. Nice. Yep. That's it. Let's go halfway. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Go for it. Let's go. Jive up. There you go. That's it. Come on. Good. Nice. Nice. Good. I'm going to do better. Easy now. Control the double bounce. Nice pause. There it is. Nice. Control. Let's go man. There you go. Yep. You guys will notice I take a little bitty pause. Johnny takes a hefty pause. Jared isn't pausing. He's just going to full range of motion. Why? A pause is not categorically better than just doing full rom in a country. It's a very easy and simple rom in a controlled pace. A pause is an option. It's a variation you can use. It's a smart variation. If you consider yourself a little bit more at risk for injury, give it a circumstance. But a lot of this comes down to personal preference and personal fit. Jared doesn't prefer to pause versus not pause, but he has noticed over the years. That for him in some exercises including this one, pausing actually makes his knee a little bit worse. But if he gently goes through that forearm, his knees feel great. So you don't have to pause. It's just an option. But if you're not pausing, think about pausing and see if it feels better or worse. And then go from there. At least one of us training on today. Joe, my name's Flex Lewis. This is me, Jim. Not yours. I don't care how strong you think you are. You come after my lucky chance. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Look, I fucking fish. Last set here for me. Benford Johnny, then we're done. I'm going to be doing a set of 13 here. I did 15 with five plates. We're doing a set of 13. And then transition right into a set of 20. I'll be 20 weight squats. Because the muscles are so fatigued. But you're just close to failure. The entire time you do that set of 20. And it is brutal. I'll probably have to rest pass that set. There's no way I'm doing 20 right away. I'm going to have to stand around a bit between reps. Crank them. So I don't know who it held rights my program. It's a stupid idea. Stupid idea. You can fall and go to my house. That's it. We have to think about it. You turn later. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on Mike. You can fall too. Come on. Drive it up. Come on. Huh? Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Push. Come on. I'd say. Drive. Come on Mike. There you go. Two more. Yep. Oh. Come on Mike. Come on. Come on. Come on. Down. Down. Oh. Push on. Fuck yeah Mike. Oh. Oh Mike. Always throwing up. Put soft music to the sky. Oh. Hello. I'm okay. You know what like it was like our TV shows at competitions. Like singing whatever. And like some of them come with own like things like with the use in. And like fucking nailed it. And then you got to go up next with some like shitty song. That's why I feel right now. I'm gonna make it look as hard as possible. They're here. Down slow. Let's go. Down slow. Let it control. Come on. Two left. Control. One more. Let's go Johnny. Let's go. Light touch. Light touch. Don't double bounce. Yeah. Four. Good shit. 13 down. Down. 14. 15. Let's go. Oh yeah. 16. 17. That's slow. Yeah. 18 to more. 19 down. Slow. Pause. Up. Yes. Oh. How's this feeling? Fuck. She's... Christ. Good shit man. Good shit. My shit hurts. And a great way. Yeah. Ask the leg workout. Johnny, what'd you think? Hard. Deficient. Effective. What'd you think? What'd you think? Two really. If you don't count the bodyweight squats. Two are sorry. Yeah. Man, it's shit. What's all I need if it was overlapping like that? For a whole week. So what'd you do to set? Yeah. Dude, thank you so much for coming on the channel. Thank you. Definitely a little bit heavy here. I'll have you again soon. Yeah. Jared. Good man. Excellent man. Actually awesome guys. Yeah. Mr. Shreeve has his own very successful YouTube channel. Where you can do three things. Learn.
