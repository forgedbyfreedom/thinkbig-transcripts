Your goal with weight training has to be must be in a fat loss phase the maximum retention of muscle mass because losing it as a possibility don't want Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for add a sound's predization should you go heavier when you're training for muscle gain and do lighter higher reps when you're training for fat loss Ooh, is this factor fiction lots of ideas let's find out what's correct and what is not The idea of going heavy for your bulk my bulker We're not again. I read the steroid forums and I'm always upset and every now and again They use terms like bulker and cutter doing a cutter and I found some wind strong underneath grammas old shelves Got my PC together Got kebergling on hand just in case sides hit Honestly if I ruled the world it would be a libertarian capitalist paradise You be I all that shit hell yeah Bernie Sanders you can stay to Everyone who's ever commented with slang and a steroid forum Lying up and fucking shot in public as a lesson Never say bulker or cutter nothing is ever on hand I'm just upset in any case When you are bulking a very common tradition through the ages has been Okay, you got to go heavy to put on mass sets of like five to twelve reps is what most guys have in mind and then in a fat loss face it Everyone kind of knows or the old school tradition is old school brother Is you do higher reps Maybe sets of 10 to 20 reps if not higher, but definitely if you tell most old school body builders Hey, like when I'm bulking and it kind of sets of five to ten five to twelve when I'm Trying to lose some fat I go to sets of ten to twenty is very unlikely anyone's gonna bad and I know I got obvious But does this actually make sense? It does make some sense other sense it does not make let's find out how first it doesn't make sense What are the cons against this view first? There's been enough research collected now or pretty confidently never sure things science is never certain We can very confidently say that heavier loads and lighter loads build a roughly equivalent amount of muscle sets of five to thirty repetitions and even a little bit outside those ranges have been shown in Almost every study study after study after study different designs different populations to just not be reliably differentiable or muscle growth So if you said something like well sets of five to ten build mass more than sets of 20 to 25 if you loop back to the literature Talk to somebody like Brad shownfeld world expert on hypertrophy then it would be like that that's actually not true And the thing is a lot of us who do the science and RP funds at one of the science and I'm a co-author in a bunch of papers nowadays We are all hardcore to begin with like we're all from that era and we all thought this was true I'm sort of hoped it was true and then we found out it wasn't So it turns out that is just not true to say that like heavier weights put on more bulk and more mass Take that for what it is if there's a probability that it's true, but it's just not evident in the literature or in real practice You got guys getting big you know like Tom Plats the way he got big legs was like ultra high reps all the fucking time Okay, so That's just Tom Plats legs didn't apply was he outlier? He looked at all the data and all the experience. This is nothing to generalize to next Lighter loads may in fact be superior for certain muscles certain exercises in a muscle gain phase On average there doesn't seem to be a difference between sets of five to ten. Sorry between sets of five all the way up to sets of 30 In specific individuals in specific muscles Some individuals seem to grow better from higher reps some individuals and their muscles on certain exercises seem to grow better with lower repetition but Because that diversity is the case you can even find lots of individuals and or muscles on individuals with just grow better from higher reps And lower ups are just not the answer for example just taking myself my biceps if I do sets of five to ten Okay, yes, stuff happens, but if I do sets of ten to 15 or 15 to 20, my shit blows up and So if I was to be a strict adherent of the okay it's time to bulk sets of five to ten my biceps just wouldn't grow that much And then when I got to the fat loss phase I would notice when I switched to higher reps like my biceps actually like unfortunately I'm not eating enough to really grow muscle now But they're just getting a better stimulus I wonder will it happen if I did this in the off season when I'm bulking and the answer is I would just get bigger So that dogmatic you got to train heavier to put on size thing isn't just not statistically an average true It's an average neutral there are many times where it's actually wrong and so if you have that dogmatic view You're gonna be wrong a lot You're gonna have the situation where you do insets a five to ten on squats and leg presses and your knees kind of hurt a little bit Your quads get a decent pump decent tension Takes you'll few days to recover and you're good to go and you're having like okay leg training and then when he buddies comes in from out of town And you hit a couple sessions with him, you know, he's there for maybe he's staying with you for a few weeks or something before you're waiting Or some shit like that get getting you ready for the married life and you hit a couple workouts with him and he's doing like a high rep program And you're like pro my legs are Exploding I'm sore all the fucking time my pumps are out of this world. I physically fucking add it like half an inch I swear to God in the last two weeks on my legs these are go up sweet. I love it. Yeah, this there's a range really works for me And then he gets on a flight and leaves and you're like all right back to bulking so that's a five to ten that didn't really work all that well for me so there are situations in which clearly higher ups work better and That doesn't make a whole lot of sense You know one thing I didn't write here on the PowerPoint which is also true is the corollary of that Is in the fat loss phase some guys if they do nice controlled slowest-centric's nice and strict injury Probability kept low sets of like eight to ten or even six to ten They can have an unbelievably More efficacious retention of their muscle tissue Some guys get say like do to soon as I start going light pre-contest my fucking shit falls off my body my muscles are start sinking off But if I keep going as heavy as I can safely I just have this fucking hard big ass look I'm able to retain all my trouble muscle That happens all the time So it's both false to say that heavy training is always best for growth and it's false to say that light training is always best for cutting Problem Next you'll hear guys this one I had to put in here to something you're gonna hear and I want you guys to be anoculated against this fucking nonsense is Why fucking build with fucking heavy weights right right? Makes sense and that fucking etch in the details on a cutter Guns loaded don't fucking say that shit again a fucking on a cutter. I'm just kidding on a fat loss phase my bad I fucking etch in the details with higher reps. Oh, okay Well, let's pretend I'm a physiologist. Oh, wait. I am of sport and Let's pretend that we know something together you and I Mr. Viewer about how muscle works and what it is Describe to me how etching in the details could possibly work from a physiological or anatomical perspective I'm sorry you're not a sculptor mother fucker either the fat decreases in size or the muscle increases in size I don't understand what etching in details can possibly mean And if you think about it long enough, it can't possibly mean anything So people who say I'm using the fucking high reps to etch in the striations that is just unabashed nonsense Muscle grows or get smaller fat grows or get smaller you want to etch in details keep your muscle the same size Or grow a little bit and take your fat stores and shrink them down details etched no rep range required People also say you know the higher reps burn more calories and that's true to an unbelievably tiny extent and makes almost no difference The real calorie sink that you generate for the deficit comes from diet a little bit of it comes from keeping up a normal slash Normal to high level of physical activity Doing your cardio get your 12,000 steps a day whatever Almost none of it comes from differences in weight training and remember weight training We have one big goal on a fat loss phase We want to make sure that we preserve as much muscle as possible Sort of attempt to build it and the building is can cancel out by the Catabolic state and then you end up at neutral most of the time ideally If you start to go k in my workouts my weight training I want to burn more calories You were necessarily sacrificing optimal hypertrophy because up my hypertrophy is like a one One target goal you shoot for that What are extra goals are or up to not? It's like if you want to go to a subway and pick up a sandwich and your friends like hey can you stop I like see the s for me to pick up like some gum like a It could it's got to cost me 20 extra minutes. But we're just not that close to friends So no, I'm not gonna do anything for you again ever bob ever Don't ask who bob is never ask me about who bob is he's dead to me in any case If the goal is getting a subway sandwich that anything you do extra is extra and if you're really crunched for time You're not just a piece of shit that says no to bob It really is taking away from the goal So if your goal with weight training has to be must be in a fat loss phase the maximum retention of muscle Mass because losing it is a possibility you don't want Trying to also co-opt it to just burn a few more calories seems like a really shit way to disturb a really Important process for a really small game I wouldn't recommend it. It's just not a thing that's gonna work Now that's all the downsides There are upsides and a lot of folks who are hashtag evidence based will be like of course That's all true and the you should just train heavy all the way through Ah, but should you there are distinct advantages to going heavier on a muscle gain phase and Later on a fat loss phase and here they are first When you're trying to bulk up especially later in the end of a bulk You're a body fat percent a bit higher and you're a lot heavier Higher ups can gas you the fuck out and because gasing out is almost defined as your cardiovascular system limits your Performance before your local musculature does As you're cranking out hamstring curls and you're now like can't breathe very well and you have to stop You might have stopped like four abshye failure where you think it's one it was one repshye of total system failure Which is why you stopped but you had four reps in the actual muscle left over. It's the lungs that kept you back If you instead didn't train for sets of 20 in the hamstring curl but try to set To do sets of 10 you might have reached one rep away from failure amazing stimulus without your lungs burning much Because you just didn't have to do tattacks drips Higher reps for muscle growth are amazing when you can do them But there may be times towards the end of a bulk where lower ups are better just because they're not limited by A cardiovascular ability and thus they are actually more effective for muscle growth On the other hand When you are cutting Higher reps can be easier to do each week instead of harder because you lean out When you're squatting for higher reps let's say sets of 15. I don't know why I fucked it ever do that Well, let's pick a more rational exercise to set 15 hack squat When you're hack squatting for sets of 15 and you're doing it in a Balking phase. Oh my god bro. You're just gonna start vomiting blood at some point and stop eight reps I fail you because you can't fucking breathe and you're rolling on the floor. I think and you're gonna this is it. I'm gonna die If you're doing sets of 15 on the hacksquat especially in the tail end of a fat loss phase You're losing weight session to session week to week And Those higher reps are much easier to do when you're physically lighter You ever notice small people can crank reps like crazy big guy does 12 reps and he's on the floor with warming up And you're leaning out a nothing in this world short of actual endurance training Makes your endurance better than losing fat. I mean, it's magical As you're leaning out you're more able to do higher reps which is great. Here's another really trippy thing As you impose a caloric deficit on your body's musculature That long-term exposure to the caloric deficit Upregulates MPK activity and downregulates M-tore activity What that means in science speak is that it makes your muscles Unfortunately slightly more catabolic likely to break down their own structures Feeding the body because it's fucking starting to death and less anabolic less propensity to grow muscle that sucks However, there's a silver lining there MPK is also the it's not just a central catabolic governor of yourself It's also one of the central governors of endurance adaptations and a lot of MPK activity actually changes your fiber type isopherms on the margin It improves it signals to improve vascularity around the muscle tissue and a ton of other Effects it actually can improve the oxygen transport ability through and to the muscle And what that ends up doing is at the longer you do a fat loss phase for and the more ambient Kindness activities that's submitted over time you actually get better at reps you get more endurance So not only getting better reps because you're getting lighter and leaner, but you're not getting better It reps internally physiologically at the molecular level That's kind of cool so you might as well lead into the shit you're getting good at as opposed to leaning shit You're not getting good at Coming back to that if you're trying to go your all-time heaviest at the end of a fat loss phase That can be needlessly injury promoting. Let's take charge of what's going on here take stock of what's going on The end of a fat loss phase you're really fatene You're to bodyweight you're not used to the cushioning of the connective tissues and the rest of your body is Minimize because you've been losing fat you're probably in a slightly less hydrated state than you would be on a ball Because you know you don't have blood face anymore and that means all of your drinks connective tissues are not dehydrated But they're less hydrated You're also fatigued in a way that affects your Coordination one of the earliest signs of high systemic fatigue and athletes is they're not as fluid and smooth anymore If they're movements they're a little shaky a little breaky they make more mistakes You make a mistake under 200 kilos in a squat of athleticism You have to lean forward a bit more something pops there it is you make a mistake under 120 kilos if you're 200 kilo squatter Right not much is going to happen So trying to go all-time ultra heavy at the end of a fat loss phase could just be getting together kind of a Consilience of let's get hurt Potentially on-wise In addition You may not be able to go as heavy as possible because you are so fatigued because your coordination is so off because your muscles are literally bereft of most of their glycogen stores which allow you to do lots of repetitive efforts If you go heavy at the end of a cut Psychologically this kind of sucks because you can literally just watch yourself get weaker That blows If you start doing some higher reps at the end of a cut The MPK transformative process for the muscle the loss of fat the loss of weight can actually allow you to Continue to either hold your ground or even make PRs especially if you're doing sets of 15 to 30 reps and you're not adding load or maybe a little load Which you're adding reps Last month of a cutting phase you do like press for four or pounds for set of 15 That next week you do for an or pounds for sets of 16 then 17 then 18 then D-load something like that You can actually make PRs which psychologically is a really awesome at the tail end of a fat loss phase is kind of like How are you able to hit PRs is it through heavy low rep? No not really okay? Don't do that Are you able to hit it with higher ups? Yes, then do that because remember we know Their ability to hold muscle is similar and also the higher-ups don't get you hurt as much It starts to be a pretty good argument here And This leads us to best practices So there's some downsides there's some upsides What are the best practices the first thing I have to say is this just generally when you're training the preponderance of your Logic for choosing the rep range should come from the stimulus to fatigue ratio that a rep range implies You can only do this by trial and error If sets of five to ten on the leg press Cause amazing tension felt in the quads closer to set the rep number ten they cause a crazy burn in the quads Your pump after a few sets is monument the muscles are clearly perked Right you try to walk away from the leg press and you're kind of walking with bent legs and someone's like You okay like let me just grab out of this drinking fountain so I don't pass out Good sign that you did something to your legs and if it gets your muscle nice and sore While at the same time Minimizing joint and connective tissue disruption Nobody's gonna be able to set to tell you that sets of five to ten the leg press are the wrong thing Because your stimulus to fatigue ratio stimulus being all those good things I said and fatigue Mostly being joint connective tissue stop, but also how much in actress I sustainically beats you up If you're stimulus to fatigue ratio, it sets of five to ten is amazing That's the right answer. Let me tell you guys about the RP high-perchography app with over 28 preset programs Already in the app you could choose to make your own you can modify an existing program or you can just run the programs Exactly as they were written by a person on this app programs everything for you Exercises weights sets reps frequency the whole thing after every single workout on every single week The app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input we have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every Single one you never have to be confused about technique or form ever again Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app download the RP high-perchography app today If you go to sets of 20 to 25 and you gas out It's your it's your cardio that's keeping you behind your muscles aren't being super stimulated You can't really feel a ton of tension at that range There is a burn but you're getting more of a burning your legs than in your muscles The pump is cool, but it's kind of a transient pump like you see some veins then half an hour later after you're done training it's gone Whereas when you go heavier it's like a pump that lasts kind of all day The muscles are perturbed like they're tired, but they're they're more fatigue than perturbed By perturbed I mean like if you go heavy and and what was sorry not heavy whatever is effective And you try to use your legs after they're gonna feel weak and wobbly and Particularly there's a coordination problem and sometimes the muscles even cramp But if you do a rep range that's not the best for you like high reps for legs for this example You could be like a like move your legs around jump around a little bit like it looks real tired You had a heavy but nothing like anything magical happened to the muscles It's just a similar to how it would feel after like a five mile run I don't know that doesn't grow a lot of muscle that's not good And if after that session you don't really get hardly sore at all Then The clearly sets of five to ten are better for you and the light press in that time then sets of 20 to 25 You will have all the data in the world as you train with the RPI Perjrfee app link in the description Of different rep ranges with different muscle loops with different exercises and you're gonna start to learn Which rep ranges give you the best results sometimes it can be a diversity It could be like there's no wrong answers for our skull crushers. I get a great pump when I do five I get a great pump when I do 30 and everything in between There could be times when it hurts your elbows times when it doesn't There could be a variation situation where you have some stainless you've been doing sets of five to ten for a while And it feels not so great you switch to sets of 20 to 25 and just the novelty alone burns you out in its amaze So at the end of the day just going with whatever is a great stimulus to fatigue ratio And to put that in another way of avoiding Exercises and rep ranges that are bad stimulus to fatigue ratio like not a lot of pump not a lot of So when I was my joints hurt this exercise, hard as fuck to do then that's not really answered And that's the best possible thing to say so if someone's like hey, you got to train heavy to build muscle That's a five to ten you got to be like oh, you know, that's true for some muscles for some of the time for me But it's not really true for most muscles and they say how do you know well stimulus to fatigue ratio So that's the key core concept to keep in mind On top of that you want to layer some other ideas consider going a bit higher up and adding reps as a former progression Instead of load especially in the last mesocycle of a fat loss phase where you're tired You can't make strength PRs anymore your injury probabilities a little higher that might just make it Psychologically and physiologically and Safety wise the better choice. I'm not saying always do it give it a shot and I don't mean ultra high reps I mean if you normally train for sets of 10 to 15 maybe more sets of 15 and fewer sets of 10 at the end of a fat loss phase Lastly When in that first Mesocycle of massing of bulking out of a fat loss phase Definitely keep lighter training in stick to the lighter ages progress in loads through them gently But don't go heavy right away What you do not want to do is finish a lot of light training on a fat loss phase and then as soon as you got some food and fuel And you win some rest you start day one of the bulk with ultra heavy shit That's a five you may want to do that But you're joint to connective tissues your tendons They're not adjusted to those heavy loads. It's a very different stimulus and because not only are they not adjusted But now you used to have very little energy and now you've been eating food you know a fuck ton of energy This is a big fucking problem because that combination of bad adjustment Two historically what has not been heavy weight in the last few weeks or even maybe months Combined with the fact that you're now feeling really strong and motivated Can cause injury and a lot of guys get hurt at this time and it's needless What you should do is through the bulk the first Mesocycle continue to train with slightly higher reps then in the next phase Picks and the lower ups and then phase after that you can if some of the lower ups are working Really start to keep doing the lower ups and slowly over time Ad weight so that by the end of your bulking phase You're doing less high-reptraining than you used to plenty of low-reptraining maybe a little bit of high-reptraining in the muscles that don't gas you out And then when you transition back to a fat loss phase again You can start training relatively heavy and then over time choose some lighter rep ranges as you continue through the bulk Sorry through the cut good god That's all I got at the end of the day folks Don't be pedantic about stuff and don't be dogmatic about Don't say well, I read this from a book so it has to be true. You could give it a little bit more thought All the evidence doesn't say that injury risk isn't hands directly By going heavy at the end of a fat loss phase because that it's that training science has never been done That doesn't mean that the reality isn't kind of quite obvious and don't be dogmatic Don't say well, this is how it works and that's it Maybe maybe some guys got some shit, you know kind of wrong I mean if you think about a lot of the arguments like well the old school guys did it Yeah, they were smaller and less well conditioned and not as impressive and they were fewer of them You say a fuck dairy bro Arnold was better there everyone's sure but how many Arnold's were there? And an adjunct Arnold said this during his day he'd be doing some exercise and he'd be like Would you get that from? And gathered from Vince Gerion the if the in guys from the 50s and I mean they really knew things in guys from the 30s I mean into it all In guys from 1910 I mean circus strong and it didn't even live weights they knew everything because old school is better That's bullshit. We learned stuff over time and some of the stuff from the past can be informative and true and some of it gets filtered away So there is some truth to going heavier and I'm Massing in a blocking phase and going later in a fat loss phase, but it's nuanced and it's not direct and Mostly what you want is the best stimulus to fatigue ratio possible Guys thanks for tuning in check out our members area.
