There you go, technique. He's got a slowest soundtrack. He's even taken a pause at the bottom. This is excellent stuff. Just kidding, his soundtrack got faster. Oh, f***. As soon as I say something, this moth f*** gets into some bro reps. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Periodization. I am an exercise in sport science professor at Lehman College in the Bronx, creator of the RP-Hyperchography app, and I'm going to look at some videos of the trend twins today to see if and how much they know about training and maybe even some special sports supplements. Let's do it. So, you want to get that? Super hero chest. Super hero look, right? He's poking out. Well, I'm going to take you to our tip routine. There are identical twins, I guess. There's two of them and one guy's got cut off sleeves and the other doesn't. They seem to look almost the same. Not so good with faces. Trend twins. I can't believe it's happening. All right. All right, fellas. Tell us how to train chest. Show you how to grow some actual knockers. I think personally the chest is the best part of a physique when you have a shirt on, you know, because if you got the chest like round and out and you could see it through a shirt, nobody's f***ing right? No one. I mean, chest are cool and shirts. Some people will f*** with you just because you're jacked. They're f***ing far between and usually associate pathic. You know, tells the guys to the club like, hey, I'm walking here. Whoa, which is the kind of high image in the trend twins talking. I wasn't very wrong. Look at this view like through the compression shirt, like all you see is the abs and then the literal tip. And the best part about having a... Literal tip. That's why you're all lift weights, isn't it? And the best part about having big titties is if you wear a pump cover, bro, you don't even have to have ads. You could be fat and the chest is going to give you that fuel. True. If you have big packs, it doesn't really matter what's happening down below. As long as your gut doesn't stick too far out, big chest kind of reps itself, you know? Are we going to worry about Benchier? Me and Mikey, we like pushing. Hey, Mikey, of course one of them is name Mikey. Is it is it the bus name Mikey? Hey, Mikey. Hey, what? Mikey? **** God of you. We like pushing strong, heavy ass weight because if you were pushing past it, let me try to get stronger every time aggressive overload on a mainly Bench compound. If you're going to force your chest to get bigger, stronger, the muscle cells are going to become well rounded. Muscle cells do not become well rounded. They either grow a shrink. Yeah, it's nice. Until the bro physiology hit, I was with him. Progressive overloads great, compound movements are great, especially when you're young, like the trend twins, pile on the weight. Going to be paid attention to technique, make sure the technique is good and the progressions actually result of getting strong and not just wiggly with the technique. Let's see what Mikey has to say. The thing that really separates like the disease is like the density and the muscle maturity. So, density is straight up not a thing. It's just not. Muscle maturity is a concept a lot of people have tried to describe. It's just something you get when you're older. But I honestly think muscle maturity is really just a factor of people eventually getting leaner over time. And when you get ultra lean, usually you're able to do this later in your life, then it reveals a definition of muscle that you just weren't ever prepared to see. If that wrong man strength looks like you're shooting. If we've unlocked that eight years of Benching, we've unlocked this shit. If you can Bench for five bowl, look at anybody bro, they have tips. I think it has to do with the muscle density and the muscle density again. Here we go. Being Chris, you have a lift and our shit is so dense. Genetics, play such a huge role. So let me actually describe to you what higher muscle density would be. Density is how much weight you can shove into how much volume. And how you look is exclusively based on a shape of your muscle and it's volume. It has nothing to do with a density. There's no evidence that muscle density actually changes in training over time with humans. But let's say muscle density was wildly elevated. That means for an external look of some of the ways one 80, they might weigh 200 pounds. You'd be like, how thick do you weigh 200? You only look one 80, they're like, but feel this muscle. And then they flex, then you felt it. You'd be like, oh my god, that's pure hard rocks. And it's like heavy. What the hell? And then I get, but nobody can tell. So you actually end up having a sleeper physique where if muscle density was really a thing, like they say it is, you could be way stronger than you looked, which is, I think the opposite of what they're saying here, they're saying muscle density gives you that f***ing like tank look. But it wouldn't even in theory and in practice and almost sure it should. A technique's very good. Full range of motion. Even taking some pauses at the bottom. What I would like to see is a bit of a slower control on the descent on the eccentric. To first of all, reduce the forces that occur in the transition between eccentric and concentric, which are a little bit probabilistically injurious. Nothing to worry about, but if you can reduce them, that's great. And also by slowing down just a bit and controlling the weight a little more on the eccentric, you probably grow more muscle because it's a great muscle growth stimulus. This is for chest gains, the grow, literal gains. So yes, you can still use your large, but make sure your ass is coming off that sea. Asothassey, definitely. That was great advice. Use the arch. No ass off the sea. Because ass off the sea, it's just pure ego lifting. You're using your hips to bench. Are you trying to grow your hips? Not all of that doesn't make any sense. So generate as much force as you can, but keep the leg drive to whatever it is that gets you stable and then you use your chest for the rest. Asothassey techniques that terrible, it's quite good. A bit rushed. I would like to see more of a back arch. I would like to see more shoulder attraction. That actually keeps the shoulder safer and it puts your chest into a pre-stretched position, which actually grows at more. And it lets you lift more weight. It's kind of the best of all of those things. There's suicide gripping, which I don't have a terrible problem with if you're interested in taking the injury risks to the face. You can get good at it and it's all about leveraging. If you leverage the bar back here, there's not really a way unless you spas out or something that it's going to roll over your fingers. Kill you. Like the way that you, after doing heavy compounds, like to the max, is just when you go to the last, you go blast high virtue for you. After it's like the pump is would you believe me if I said the pump would be insane if you did hypertrophy first? As a matter of fact, if you weren't tired from benching, you could get a real great hypertrophy first and only work out. Oh, no. Come on. You got four in you. Come on now. Three reps touching go at 405 is in competition anywhere between 405 to 425 for a max. I don't know if they're peaked right now or if they're on trend. But it's the always on trend. Mm, that should better be. Oh yeah. Oh, I put it up with it. 455 that didn't go. This is just me talking as shit. When you biff on four reps with 405, there's not a situation in which you take 455 in your next attempt. It's just near just not good for it. And it clearly wasn't. This stuff is fun. It's dope. It go for 455. But as you become older, 25, 30, 35, the probability of you getting hurt on any one of these way outside of your comfort zone PR attempts starts to climb. This going for 455. This is the epitome of bro lifting in the gym. That's why the trend twins are the trend twins. They are bro's to the end and they say some really good stuff. But then shit like this is like, I just wouldn't do it because it's not worth your time. That should felt like a ton bro. I think you just seen your head broken. Did you know that you're nowhere else ever, but in your head? Think about that. Yeah, come on. My hands are way too good. Guys, fundamentally the most important thing after misleaf is you have to have like a loaded six cylinder of excuses. People are pretty smart and they look at you and they watch you miss it and inevitably some of them they're going to start to do their GPT in their head and they go, oh, oh this person isn't this strong as they go a nope right away. You get in there with some excuses and it f**ks with their mind and they go, oh okay, it's just that his hands were and I love that halfway through the excuse. He just abandoned. He's like my hands were like, hey f**k, and you know, whatever the reason that you didn't get 425 is you're not throwing up to get it on that day. And it's not a big deal. If you want to see the full uncensored version of this video, much more extra content, some stuff we did not put into this video, our members area is a for grabs, give that a shot and maybe we'll see you guys there. I really like this myth first. All right, so we're doing incline Smith press very good for extra hypertrophy work, which wouldn't be required if you just train heavy, but I guess I'm being a dick. You can control the weight all the way down on a bar belt. But get really deep. You can get exactly as deep on a bar belt. Very good technique. Very seemingly very mindful. Got his shoulders retracted back. Chastes seems to be up. He's got a slowest centric. He's even taken a pause at the bottom. This is excellent stuff. Just kidding is a centric got faster. Oh, f***. As soon as I say something, this moth f*** gets into some bro reps. Now he's not touching his chest anymore. Just doing the mid range. This is just so you get more reps and move the weight around a bit and feel your swag. This doesn't have to do with anything optimal or growing the most muscle. He's done like what five reps are six reps of this is. Good. Now we're on to seemingly incline flies. I think. Could be a fly press combo. That's a lot of weight. Yep, it's a fly press. So the fly press is something that kind of starts out as a fly. And then as you get deeper it turns into a press. And then as you press halfway up, you finish with the fly. Great exercise. I would love to see them spend a second or two at the bottom. Really milking that stretch and going slow on the way down. Let's see if that happens. No, it does not. They do have tasty juicy packs don't they? Oh, there's two of them. I mean four. They're twins, right? Let me tell you guys about the RP Hypertrophy app. With over 28 preset programs already in the app, you can choose to make your own. You can modify an existing program or you can just run the programs exactly as they were written by eight personal. This app programs everything for you. Exercises weights sets reps frequency, the whole thing. After every single workout and every single week, the app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input. We have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one. You never have to be confused on technique or form ever again. Guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app, download the RP Hypertrophy app today. Okay, we're on to our 50th exercise for the day. This is the machine fly. He stand kind of upright and a shoulder to stand forward even at the bottom. I would love to see him reach arch back, shoulders back as far as possible to really open up that chest at the very bottom. And as that chest opens, you slow down and pause at your deepest position, which rips your pack fibers and new one and seems to cause more growth than any other kind of technique here. So this is a terrible technique, but it's not to ever find. Oh, they're doing the side angle pack press bullshit. Folks, let me tell you about the section sizes. Inordinately, uncomfortable to do it to get in the machine. It was not designed for to do this. You're also pressing from sort of here to here. There's not a lot of stretch in the pack. And the stretches were more of the growth happens than the contraction. If you contraction not a ton of growth happens, can you get a little bit more inside the chest fiber activation or recruitment in growth potentially by a tiny fraction with this? Maybe, but also like that's what cable flies and machine flies are for and they've already done machine flies. So I would say this is starting to look like junk volume. This whole like taking a muscle and just torturing it, the beating it while it's on the ground. I can't even tell you any more secrets. It's just bleeding out of its mouth and you're kicking it again. Like it's fun for the soul to really like trash and muscle, but it's been shown a few times that at some point the damage is so much itself to recover from it takes away from the total stimulus magnitude. It takes away from the adaptive ability of the muscle. Because your body has one pool of resources from which to grow muscle and heal damage. And there's a balancing act there. And if you go away too much damage, your body's like, hey, I'm not trying to grow anything. I'm just trying to make sure your pecs fix themselves for your next workout. Fix doesn't need improve just fixed to be as good as last time. Oh man, are you guys kind of in the chest exercises with me? It's like exercise number five or some shit like that. Too much in one session. It's not the work I'm against. You've got to split that work up through the week. So these dips are fine again slower, control on the lowering. A second or two at the bottom to get the packs to really stretch, opening up big with the chest. This guys can get deeper than this. The lower you go, the more the stimulus rises and the relative cost to fatigue that you're paying decreases in proportion. So the stimulus to fatigue ratio of going super deep on all of your dips and presses is just really awesome. These, this is an okay technique here. There's a distinct lack of mind muscle connection. You can see his moving his body, turning it halfway through. Maybe for the camera. This is not like a very intense set. Like he's getting the work done, but it's not of a high quality's positioning isn't precise. Every rep looks a little different than the last made it quite a bit different. This is not a distinct cutoff top end bottom end for the range of motion. It's exactly what you would expect when someone's kind of too tired to be doing hard work anymore, but they're still at the gym. So not only did they do push downs. I assume for some number of sets. Now they're doing one arm push downs. Second, try some exercise. You must be about eight exercises at this point. I have no idea they're still going. And to be honest, they're not really going. You can tell there's a palpable difference in intensity. Fine, relax your sizes. I like to end up close to good benches. There's been so much chest and triset work done already. The vast majority of it have relatively low intensity, relative effort. The guys are just tired and they really just kind of blew their load on benching. That I just don't know what it is we're getting out of this close grip work. Now, because it's close grip work, because it's with a barbell, chances are the guys are going to close to failure again. It's my bet you put a human male on a barbell, they're going to go to failure, but again, it's just so late in the game and so stimulus driven that now such huge fatigue levels, I just don't know if it makes sense to be here anymore. You see the grip are really close and it prevents them from going all the way down. That close of a grip prevents you from getting as much of an extension in your triceps and as much of a strategist possible. That's not ideal. I would prefer to see them grip a little bit wider, so they could actually touch the bar to the chest, keep in their elbows flush on the inside, and touch relatively high up. So touch just above the nipple line and that way you get a huge, longest stretch on the tricep. We actually do a video at our pee of how to use the close grip bench to target the triceps better. Encourage you guys to look into that if you want some more technical details. That was chest and triceps. Good stuff generally a lot of good movements, lots of compound pressing, very decent range of motion, but always everyone including myself can be criticized and I would say this is a good, the other dooses could be minus work. Be minus. I know I switched my grading scale from 1 to 10 to grades, but I have a professor after all, so my little hand out actually letter grades be minus, good effort, some stuff trending in the right direction, but if you want that D plus A minus A A plus work, you're going to have to work on cadence, controlling that eccentric more, accentuating the deepest parts of the range of motion, controlling the weight and keeping the reps similar the entire time and of course, arranging the workouts such that they are effective, but don't take 16 hours to complete and are spread more throughout the week. Browshine is brochured, it's cool, that the reason a sciencey folks don't do the brochure anymore is because we found a slightly better way at least. All right, so that was trend twins, chest training. You guys want us to review other folks, let us know the comments who you want us to review and we'll take a look fairly and with a bit of biting, sarcasm, really just jealousy that I'm not a trend twin. Just to all of them, see you guys next time.
