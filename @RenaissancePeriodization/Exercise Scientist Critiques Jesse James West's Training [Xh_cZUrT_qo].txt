And I'm Jesse James looks good. Wow. And she's look at that f***in' armdude. Somebody drug test Jesse James West. Hey Greg, you set. Aaaaaaahhh. Okay, thanks Greg. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Pyrridsation. I'm the co-creator of the RPI-PIRTRIV app. And a professor of exercise and sports science at Lehman College in the Bronx in New York City. In New York State, in the United States in North America, in the Western Hemisphere, on planet Earth, in the solar system, in the Orion arm of the Milky Way galaxy. And I forget what cluster of galaxies were in, but no doubt I'll get to that in the next video. Alright, we are here to review the training sensation that is Mr. Jesse James West. And there are only two types of people that are allowed to have three names. serial killers. Hmm. Or, outlaws in the West, like Jesse James West, which is, it's got to be guys in Jesse James, like an old outlaw. Except this Jesse James doesn't really shoot guns. He just shoots workouts and handsomeness. Did I say that out loud? Let's say more crazy things out loud. Hit it. This is Hony Ramot 22-time Olympia Winning Coach. No for coaching athletes such as Seabum, J. Color, Billy and so many more legends. He touches the guys a lot, which I'm a big fan of. Today, he'll be putting me through his FST 7 workout. Let's go. I will say Jesse James has an unbelievable amount of presence energy. Honey's like Jesus Christ, man. He's like, ah, I love it. Someone showed up to work. What are you normally doing? So I'm normally doing a press, two side raises, and like two rear, someone's something like that. Okay. Okay, so we're training shoulders, cool. Trying to focus my side del is definitely my most weak. Side del's most weak. Most people, when they want the aesthetics of bigger shoulders, they're looking for bigger side del's. They are rear del's are quite easy to train just with full range of motion pulling movements that you train for your back. But your front del's almost entirely handled by pushing, work for like chest shoulders, tri-steps, really side del's I maintain, or maybe 80% or even 100% of what you should be training when you're training for del's. We'll see this, what this workout has in store. The techniques generally very good. I would love to see Jesse go considerably lower, touching the inside of the dumbbell to the outside of a shoulder at the bottom and holding for one second, that deep painful stretch has been shown scientifically, to result in more muscle growth. So that would be really, really cool. Other than that, it looks like quite a good shoulder press. Yeah. Slow down a little bit. So honey said something very important, slow down a little bit. It's good to slow down that eccentric. The descent under control that causes a lot more muscle growth stimulus. And because you have to slow it down, you can't use weights that are as heavy. You gotta go lighter. It's even safer that way. Good job. So what we want to do now, catch your breath. Okay. If you notice you're speaking really, really quickly, your heart rates really high. He said, if you notice you're speaking really, really quickly, I think Jesse James is just excited to be around Mr. Honey Ramon, makes sense that I've turned almost everyone he's ever met prone. And then also get a sip of water. This is really good stuff. You want to really break between sets because you want maximum energy you put into high quality ultra-effective set. You don't want to go too fast in the gym. If you're doing it for regular workout, just normal fitness cool, but if you want to build some muscle, which is what Honey Ramon specializes in, then you're definitely going to want to take some breaks between sets. Get your breathing back to normal. Feel strong again and then go. Allow yourself to walk around a little bit for a few seconds. Get your heart rate down. I'm just so excited, man. But got to remain chill. Now let's go ahead and do a standing lateral raise. Show me what you normally do. Just let me see your form. Okay. What's really good? That's actually it's quite good. That's a slightly different variation. But the nice thing about it is you're not resting here. That's one thing you do not want to do. You don't want to rest here. And he's doing a great job not doing that. Okay. You can totally rest at the bottom. If you rest at the bottom, that rest by using more repetitions. If you don't rest at the bottom, you can do fewer repetitions but you accomplish roughly the same amount of muscle growth stimulus. So, not resting versus resting is really just personal preference. You can even combine them. You can do as many reps as you can. Not resting, then come down rest for a second and then do a few more reps. So, not really any dog may hear resting at the bottom is totally fine. I'm all about keeping the tension on the muscle. But the tension is what you sum up over the multiple reps. If you put in tension, rest, put in tension, rest. Your muscles count the tension that you put in all to the scene piggy banks. You don't have to keep the constant tension all on at the same time. You can pulse it in and that's totally fine. Keep going. Awesome. One more, one more, one more. I'm not entirely sure what the purpose is of touching someone while they're training. Unless you're bringing attention to various cues. Like if you touch their side out while they're training it, I'm inclined to believe there may be some additional mind muscle connection benefit. I'll be at radically small. This sort of gripping around the waist, Titanic bullshit they got going on over here. It's hot and all and I'm all here for it. But it might not be very, very effective. Maybe he's trying to help them out a little bit. But then again, like your reps are your reps man and over a really connect with your body. You've got to do this shit yourself. I'm a pretty firm believer of that. I'm just, I guess, not sold on the benefits of touching someone without a compelling reason during the workout. Although if it's Jesse James West that's working out with me, I'm touching him as much as I possibly can. Also with my hands. Hey guys, if you want more, uncut raw, unedited, too hot to share on YouTube version of this, then consider joining our membership for this channel and you get all this crazy stuff plus a lot more educational content every single week. See you there. Can you see me do the flex sets, right? Yes. So what we're doing is we're creating more time under tension by being able to flex in between sets. Now going to a most muscular crab. Like that, wider, wider, get your lats out. There you go and squeeze and get your hands a little closer to your body. There you go. Keep that tension on there. We're going to hold that for another 10 seconds. So that definitely puts some tension on the side delts. The problem is the C-sflecting is biceps. Triceps, forearms, chest, back, abs, everything. That's a lot of fatigue for something that is doing what exactly to the delts. So by flexing like that, your whole body, before you do another set, you're reducing how strong you're going to be for that set. You're reducing how many reps you're going to be able to get. And the reps you get for that next set, they're very specifically hypertrophic muscle growth promoting to the side delts themselves. So you're kind of doing a little bit of whole body stuff. Also asymmetrically, isometric contractions don't cause reliably as much muscle growth as likely a centric contractions do or concentric the ones that you're moving actual weight. So I would say this is like okay thing to do, but probably makes you a little bit too tired than optimal for your next sets without as much of a trade-off as you'd like to see in the beneficial direction. 9, 8, 7, 5, 4, good job. Oh, woo! It's getting straight. It's straight catcher breath. Jesse James is very impressive looking shoulders. Hmm. That was the craziest thing I've ever done. Jesse, it's almost certainly not the craziest thing you've ever done. I've seen your other videos. You've talked around them girls and picked them up out of the street. And I pick up, I don't mean physically left. I mean emotionally left. And that to me is a lot crazier than flexing in a gym. Call me crazy. They're FST 7, Flexets. Okay, FST 7, Flexets. Right. First time ever doing it. What exactly is FST 7 training? That created this FST 7 training style, which increases the intensity with or without me there. Obviously it's going to be a little more intense because I'm actually here, but it's going to help with more of that three-dimensional look. More of the three-dimensional look. Huh. I thought that was just growing muscles, but what do I know? I'm just a professor of exercise and sports science. Because we're doing hypervolume training with high intensity training. That's what FST 7 is. Every kind of training has a volume and intensity. I don't know if it's completely accurate to say there is such a thing as volume training or such a thing as intensity training. But you can have training that is of a lower volume, but higher relative effort, further beyond failure or two failure. And you can have training that has more volume, more number of sets, but each set is significantly sub-naximal, such that you're stopping three or four up-shy failure. So that effect you could have a more volume biased or relative effort, which is the technical term for intensity, bias training. That all being said, the right answer is to give the liftor for that session, the correct issue, number of sets to do with a correct relative effort and then every workout needs to get a little bit harder. Maybe the relative effort climbs every single week. Maybe the number of sets stays roughly the same or even increases if that person is recovering. So a 7 is kind of an arbitrary number to give someone. I would like someone to start with FSD 4 and then work their way up over a period of two months to FSD 8. That would be I think really, really good. But generally that FSD 7 system isn't awful, it has a lot of work and if you are using good technique and recovering appropriately, it can definitely work to help you put on muscles. So you're going to keep your chest up in here or working on your right hand for focusing right in the front. Again, I'm not entirely sure what the point is of touching someone. Maybe I'm just weird about that. This is a front raise, it's decent. Unfortunately, it's a front raise that bias is the shortened position of the dealt, which is not the most muscle growth promoting. If you actually turned around completely in that bench and this is a totally fine variant, but if you're looking for a way to enhance this at home, turn around in the bench and then do the same exercise, but start with your arms way below you and behind you, the big stretch on the front dealt is really what grows. Just come up until you're parallel to the ground and come back down. You'll almost certainly rep for up the at least mildly superior to this version. Again, this is a totally fine version, just another idea for you guys to try it home. Oh my god. Good. So I don't think you normally do those. Oh, I, as the first one I've literally ever done those. Okay, I don't think you do front raises at all. I don't think you can raise it. Okay, so you need to start doing it. You need to start doing it. I would say the front raise done properly. If you take your pinkies and turn them to the sky and you do a front raise like that, it can actually significantly recruit your side dealt switches good. That raises with your thumbs up are almost exclusive to front dealt. Ever seen anyone's physique be limited by their front dealt. Everyone who trains their chest, show end and triceps in any capacity that's challenging also has to train their front dealt. Every pushing movement trains front dealt. And I would say front dealt basically get trained enough so that front raises unless you're doing them for side dealt and they're front a little bit out to the side with the pinkies up. Those are cool. Every other kind of front raise is probably you could use your time better training your side dealt more. You heard the man don't be skipping the front dealt. Okay. Skip the front dealt. Everyone was lying to you. Not everyone. All right guys, so what we're going to do is we're going to do bent over a ladder raises. We're going to do pinkies up so we can be able to create a better focus on the rear dealt. So the two major techniques, once with palms down, once with pinkies up, we're going to do them both ways so you can be able to see the differences because they're just slightly different nuance to that exercise. Ooh, curious. That definitely is an effective exercise. The pinkies up means that your fibers turn into the direction of the movement and it's great stimulus for your dealt. So very good. It also hit a lot of traps and upper back, which is totally fine. Again, I'm not a big fan of rear dealt training because I think if you're doing four engine motion pull ups, pull downs, rows of all kinds, your rear dealt are going to be very, very, very sufficiently trained and then side dealt are probably the ROI best thing to train after that. Good job. You chest up, can you chest up? Good. Squeeze those shoulders a bit. There you go. Ah, we're still doing the squeezing thing. I was like, chest up for what? The set is over. Hmm. What do you get when PhD sports scientists collaborate with pro bodybuilders? The most effective muscle growth training app ever made. Get yours now. Slow, give me five seconds. Let's go to the way down. Five, four, three, two, good job. Slowies are on tricks to great. I'd like to see him push his chest up a little bit more and to finish the rep behind his body to stretch that bicep at the bottom a little bit better. But this is very good. And she's looking at that f***ing arm, dude. Nobody drug test Jesse James West. Hey, Greg, you said. Mike, what's going on? Can you do a video of Jesse James West's on drugs or not? Okay, thanks, Greg. So we're doing some biceps now on this one. We're basically doing a hammer using the rope. I always call that the double dildo curl. Yeah, buddy. Yeah, buddy. Shall I start the running column impressions now or later? We'll see if we're for later. Yeah, buddy. Let's take a bite. Let's take a bite. Wow, here we go. This is eight-time Mr. Olympia, Ronnie Colby. Oh my god, he wore the same pants. Jesse James has a lot of energy. If I was Ronnie, I'd be like, uh, what the hell you doing? When am I pants? That's not cool at all. Mother f*** you, my f***ing me, is that? Right way, right way, baby. Oh, it's real light, Ron. Here you go. What's the saying? Not doing what to do it. None to it, but to do it. Ain't none but a peanut. Woo! I can do it all folks, all day long. Oh, I'm just trying to stay away from my arm just going to shut the f*** up. All right. Not to do it, but to do it. Yeah, buddy. Hey, 225. So Jesse James, his technique on the bench rest was quite good. I would like to see him control the central a little bit more as Russian, or the eccentric, but otherwise very good for any emotion. I will categorically never criticize Randy Coleman's technique because they're men, and then they're gods. That's all I'll say about that. Get it, I'm going, whoop the man? I'm a wopioa-ass if you don't do this for at least 57,000 rips. Good technique. Again, a little too quick on the way down, too quick of a reversal at the bottom. And for some reason, people leave like that half inch or an inch at the top, that inch, that bottom inch. Let me tell you, is the most growth promoting part of the movement. I would say slow and control pause, and then a send. But definitely like this is like an A lift technique. Why is I'd love to see an A plus? Don't knock a lie, this is this is the workout's very intense right now. Uh-oh, not ideal for five days out. And it feels really good to train. I love training when you run. Yeah, buddy. He literally just gave a yeah buddy while on his phone. Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it. Uh-oh, yeah, yeah, buddy. And that's right. I damn white motherf***er my dream, but the hell going on out here? And I get a new counsel for that impression. Maybe it's all love Mr. Ronnie. Back in the day. I like how Jason here was like, yeah, he didn't know what the f***ing I am, what's going on. Would you focus more on barbell or dumbbell? Oh. He's like, yeah, can you get the f*** out of my face for a second? I'm goddamn, who the f*** are you? He's like, oh, we're filming an interview. Oh yeah, that's right. Both, what a f***ing sweet answer. Both. One day was all barbell and one day was all dumbbells. I never used cables or machines. I'm going to hell. Damn, Jesse James looks good. Wow. I guess he's five days out of a show or something? Yeah, natural, natural body. Oh, natural bodybuilding show. You impressive. Man's physique and bodybuilding. Wow. Thanks Scott the video guy. You f***ing stalker. Anime characters are known for wearing weighted clothes to gain superhuman strength. And today I'm joined by Lean Beat Patty. Oh my god, an old friend of the channel, I guess, though she, like most of her fans, doesn't know that we exist. Hello, darkness, smile friend. To see what it's like to wear them for the next 24 hours. Oh f***ing bad. First competition, we got the rope climb. Let's see who's stronger. Oh, good god. Houston, we have a major problem. No, I can't get up. Yo, rope climbing looks like it. I could do this. It's f***ing hard. And there's just weird technique you have to do with your legs and also other bullshit. That. I would get negative two reps on that f***ing rope. There we go. Cross your legs. I need help. Good job. I like how Jesse James figured it out and then he was like, wait a minute. Okay, I figured it out, but it's still too hard. No, no. You're up there. You got to do it yourself. This is one of the hardest things I've really ever done. Meet me in real life, Jesse James, and I'll put you through a hard thing you've never done, but it'll be done with you. I just do you. Oh, wow. Oh my god. He did it. Folks, anytime you train with a girl, especially a fit girl, your number one priority should be to embarrass her. I'm better at this than you are. Meal. And when she realizes she is physically inferior, she's going to develop an emotion called infatuation with you. That's how pickup works. Short lesson. You're welcome. We're going to see who could do 100 situps, the fastest. Go. That I would quit it like three. I'm just kidding. I can't do three situps. One. Oh, shit. Lean beef, patty's all on this motherfucker. This is way more difficult than I thought it was going to be. I underestimated this. Dude, 100 actual situps is f***ing tough. Which means it's not. People to say, are you 100 situps every five hours? Shut the f*** up. No, you don't eat those little bullshit pulse crunches. You f***ing liar. You're not even struggling. I'm going to be sweating. Ambed it. Lean beef patty's just showing off at this point. Don't hold a rocky ball, but who action? Too easy, easy day for lean beef. No, it's fine. I'll just take the L. Max pull ups in 60 seconds. This is going to be really hard. I know this is just all for fun folks, but with that in mind, I'm going to judge the living f*** out of their pull up technique. Go patty, go one, three, wow. I'm bored. That's a strong woman. The technique's all f***ed. As expected. F***ing tallity. Take your time. Take your time. Seven. Ooh, that was okay. The 70 counted when she just started lifting up. I don't think she got anywhere. I don't know how you count up a pull up at the beginning of a wrap. Very well. Okay, come on patty, eat. Go go, go. Up, patty. Nice. That's all we have. Patty going for it. Her celebration really put me down right now. Yeah, a lot of fine kids have him fighting. Alright. I wanted this. I asked for this. My body weight. Plus this on the bar. Yes. And that's like actually like 100 pounds. Pretty much. Yeah. And we're going to see who we need the most. If he are, it is not easy. And I am actually terrified of getting hurt. Well, why is it so heavy? There you go. How's it going? It a long time. Alright. So lean beef patty. Plus a hundred pounds. weighs a hundred and thirty two pounds. More of a silver one. Oh, we're just warming up. I'm being a dick early. Ooh. I'm not going to lie. Way harder. But. Wow. Six. You feel like a little uneven. Why are you trying to get my head patty? I think herdsmiths. Seven. Wow. Oh my gosh. Eight. Does it be terrible? Do you guys also hate it when the video guys don't give you an angle or time frame in which to judge squat depth and technique? Looking at it from the front. Kind of skipping the bottom part a little bit with the camera. I just can't tell if these are good high quality reps. I want a judge damn it. But I can't. I need raw material for judging. That did not look sufficiently deep. I would count that as zero. Is that still a warm up? Come on. Ready? Up. That is a half squat. I'm a coxucker. I know. All right. So. Jesse James. On the lifting. Uh. 8.5 out of 10. Generally very good range of motion. Very good control. I'd left to see a little bit of a slow down on the eccentric and a little bit of a pause at the bottom for stuff. Um, we'll talk about the squat and pull up stuff that was all just for laws. And on the personality and just lean and invigorated young man, a 15 out of 14.5. Am I a fit for answer yet? See you guys next time.
