That's trash in your income around. I'm always a fussy. I'm coming. I live Vegas. No, Vases are rich people play. No, it's not. It needs money to be in Vegas. I've seen the last place I've seen. I've seen the last place I've seen everywhere. There's Casinos, Jen. I hope it just... There's a wasted money. Here's the thing, guys. Vegas also has the Olympia, which is coming to you in a couple weeks. Couple weeks. And we're going to put this video out just a couple weeks before. And we're going to have Olympia predictions. So feel free to use this as a proxy IQ test and retroactively Great Us on how well we did. Yeah. And I'm a classic physique pro. Mike isn't a bodybuilder. So we're just going to stick to those two divisions. Although I have my guess. There are other different. I have my guess. Name the other divisions. Go where I go. Okay. You have men's physique. Two, twelve. Fitness. Everybody forgets about fitness. Don't forget about fitness. Fitness are actual athletes. The only athletes of the Olympia. We're like actual like ex-geness and stuff like that. Yeah. Fitness. You look like that. What can you do? She has some kind of crazy split mid-air. Oh, yes. Women's bodybuilding women's physique are bikini. We forgot well enough. And while it's of course. Well, I didn't forget. It's just my. It's always. You're going to get your point. That's why I don't know. You're going to get that well. Yeah. Try to forget well this. Of course I'm my prediction. So I'm going to be sure. We're going with what? What? Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Then Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. Class C. and Sean King, French. Oh, that Chinese man. Who follows our people? No way. And us, my man. Yeah? Yeah. He was the very intelligent trainer actually. Yeah. Cods like that. Yeah. He's got a great book. Yes, I agree. His quad is ridiculous. That was great. No surprises, nothing no upsets. Uh, I mean, he would be one. He could kind of go up. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Because he knocks out Brianna on the top five. That's pretty cool. Because that'll be the first time Brianna's on top five. What's so mad about what you hate non-Briya? Uh, I'm not hate non-Brianna. This is YouTube. This is a public race. I say some shit. You're a brand. It's great. He's been going down to you. He's been going down. Yeah. He's been going down the ring for the fucked up. Yeah. You know, when you have guys that are better, that there's better, it's not a big deal. I got my ass with this year. Whatever. That's what's left. That's respect. Okay. Jerry's on that low. Classic physique. Good. West next to 12. Just open your own studio. 12. 12. I don't know because this is exciting. Lonsford's going to the open. Oh, he is. You know, bloodsford. I'm looking at his videos at two thoughts. One, that's not a human being. Yeah. Two. How is he a little me too 12 motherfucker? He's not. And so like you might not open. He's the only two I have battling out would be like Clarita and Keyon. Because Keyon looks ridiculous right now. Keyon is the person who has the best genetics in the world. Of all time, probably. It's impressive. And Sean Clarita has to eat for three weeks after the show to get back to zero percent body fat because he's negative when he competes. Then you say you saw him in real life. Yeah. And you were like, Jared was like, Mike, the pictures and the videos. They don't do any justice. It's not a real person in real life. They're literally like, when you see somebody like you were tanning. Literally tanning next to each other. Like his quads don't make sense because every, this is highly genetic. He's just very fortunate. Every part of this quad has striations on it all the way up all the way up. So even when he hits just front relax, some of those people have separation. They don't have the striations because they're hitting it like hips back. Yes. Even with his hips back, his hips is just striated. That's fucked up. But Keyon has this issue too. And better shape. Way better shape. Keyon's shape is unstoppable. Yeah. So if you come to the end. So he comes in and has some trouble coming in. Correct. But he's at whatever five or four weeks out, whatever it is. And he's looking the part. He looks like he's ready. Yeah. So it's going to be cool. And he's bigger than Clarita. Much taller and much. He's too tall. Yeah. He might be too, too if I don't know. Chuck Clarita's tiger guy. You see him in pictures. You're like, that guy's just jacked. Really bad. If fat free looking guy. What do you think? Oh, like people can knock him off. He's not great. The thing is like beating him in real life. It's a lot easier said than done. Yeah. You got to be Derek. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's very interesting. Very exciting. I was going to say lunchford forever until I realized he was no longer in the division. Is that true? Or is he still going to cut down? These guys play games, bro. Derek and the open. It's confirmed. He's like, he must have he might be in my top five. Yeah. He's all man. His physique. Yeah. If I was Derek lunchford right now, I would just stop training. Take 10 pictures and retire. You're like, I did it. I'm the perfect human being. I agree. All right. Two 12s are exciting. Let's go to the open class. Rammy. So I had this conversation with somebody earlier for God. I forgot what the fuck it was. But they were like, the agraramies and trouble. XYZ is in it. And I'm just like, you do understand that Big Ramey has just posted, with maybe with some of his most pleasing lines ever. At a bodyweight of 339. Mm-hmm. And he already has strations. Yeah. Because if there's not something you just go, oh, he'll just get his ass kicked. And also, now that he's working with wasn't Chad Meckles, I guess. Yeah. He has completely feathered and dry glutes. Or the man who weighs 2.95 on stage has completely feathered groups. And on like running Coleman, I know I'm talking about shit. Ron is the goat. Fear, always will be a running Coleman. He has a streamlined mincection. Great line. Caped out. One guy was like, yeah, man, I wish Big Ramey had a bigger back. What? So he could fly away. Are you out of your fucking mouth? Listen, that some guy has fucking best back. No, so no, it's back. That's pretty much the wrong one. It's a running. Oh, Ronnie. That's a big, Ronnie needs a bigger back. No, Ronnie has one of the best back. It's ridiculous. It's like, I don't understand how your last backlatch you got this. Big is backlatch, but it's never been on the old beer stage. But apparently it's not good. That's hilarious. So in any case, Big Ramey has to be something magical has to happen for him to lose. He has to come off and somebody has to come in to really fucking pond. Yeah. Who typically is it like you don't break it? Chippon. How did you ponder? He did. Who said last year? Second or third. We were second and we're in a, um, uh, ran and got there. I don't know if you're memory that correctly. In my memory, there's wrong. I don't know. I know that he had like an issue with like somebody felt he had sight and handsman and stuff and his delts. So sure. He got knocked down or something. So how did your pond looks incredible? Well, he doesn't have that physical size. Right. He just shredded the bone. Shredded the bone. He has great lines. It's like the cleary to shit. Right. But not amazing. The reaction looks like he's 23 and never took drone, which is not. Then there's, uh, Brandon Curry. Who I think, I think one's for it's going to be. Oh, wow. Brandon Curry looks really good though. Curry will look his all-time best and I still think there's like 48. And I still think Derek one's for it. Derek one's for it's crazy. So you think Derek left for it's looking into that top five? I really do. I think you've slipped into a few things through your life. Yeah. But the top five he's slipping in. Yeah. I think I think he's high chance of placing really really well. Yeah. Look third worth. Wow. What do you see Nick Walker in that equation? I don't think Nick's making top five. I think Bonac is also looking his both. Bonac showing up. Bonac's always looks flawless. Best ever. And you got Curry. So that's five. I don't think Nick Walker slips into five. Now what about, uh, And I think that there are many people in her library. I think there are many people in the library. I don't think Hunter Beat and Nick last year. I think Nick's real voice hire. I think Hunter looks great. Hunter looks bigger and leaner and a meter I might add. Yeah. I think a lot of these guys try to add sides way too fast and they lose a lot of separation. Like it loses a lot of like Hunter use that really deep watch for like separation. And then as she got bigger you don't really see it. Like it's from relax. It's like that's a really nice shape. But there's not a lot of separation. So he does have a great waist of huge arms. Yeah. But Nick Walker's arms are bigger and his back's better. Are they really? Oh yeah. They walk his arms don't make his legs. He's big. I think six maybe. But there's also like Andrew Jackson going. And if it was up to me, Samson doubt it would be in that mix. Samson doubt it has been like 80 pounds of muscle in the last one. It's like getting to that Ronnie stage where you're like that's not really. Yeah. All the shape guys have been that mix. Like I really love, uh, how do you say profile? Rafael. Rafael, bro do. I just, that's jujitsu. All the shape guys would be one end if I was, you know what I'm saying? Because you don't have what it takes to get big enough. Right. Exactly. No, but Samson doubt I think is going to really surprise people to make the top 10. Ian could also be a brother. I am. Valle. Yeah. He comes in. He's big. Well, brother. It comes off sometimes. I look at Ian's training weights and I'm like, I think I have good genetics, but that's the next level of shit. Like, is it, why would you incline press like five plates on every machine? And he's just being completely unaffected by it. Yeah. He's really intense. He or his legs big enough. No, he's missing improvements definitely. And his back is improved to shit live. So I think he could definitely take the broad out. You don't got to win the front poses. You just got to win the rest. I don't want to. Yeah. And he wins this side just. Yes. Yes. It's like chef. And he's like, you're here. The broad the right side tries it was nice. But I think Ian's just at the end of the day, all these predictions are nonsense because it all depends on who comes in and shape on the day. Because if you could speculate about muscularity and conditioning and most guys deliver, but it's, sorry, muscularity. But is it already dry and full on that day, especially dry? If you are super dry out of your mind, then you're going to do well if you're not. Yeah. Then you could do much worse than people expect. Yeah. Which is why so that top five, I think it's pretty sad and storm, but like I said, like, Nick can easily squeeze in there. Any other guys that would stick to squeeze in there. Like, depends if everybody else comes in shape or not. Folks, without they're looking now, that's how I see it. This is exciting times. Yeah. It's probably the, it is second, third, fifth golden age of bodybuilding. And this is the biggest Olympia of all time. No way. Of all time. They're like 60 qualified classic guys over 30 bodybuilders. Wow. Because like the COVID thing made, yeah. Like the qualification period really weird to 14 months or something. Sure. So like, even I like competitor. Yeah. Like there was the last show to qualify for classic was last week and I made it 60 guys. I'm pretty sure. Is how did you pun? Is there any status updates on his visa or is he in American now? Is he going to be able to make it to him? Yeah. He's making it all the thing. Yeah. International politics of suits. But yeah. But you know, it's just all freedom and prosperity and welcome to go to bodybuilding. Anyway, politics aside. Thank you so much to you for that insight. I've no idea who these people are. The fact that I sometimes pleasure myself to thinking about them. Yes. And folks, if you think we're wrong, please be nice. But get in the comments. Me, me. You know, and tell us what your top five is for any class you want to talk about. We'll get in there and tell you why you're stupid. Yeah. And then you couldn't possibly be right about anything, especially this. See you next time. Thanks, stop for a bit.
