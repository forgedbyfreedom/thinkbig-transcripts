Like their whole thing is this is right you are wrong and it's getting back to like the conditioning of I want to get a degree so I know I can get a job. I want to know it's gonna work It's a it's a snake oil of an idea like in in their world. It's I wish there's a pill Sam you take steroids bro Hey folks Dr Mike here for RP strength I am have been a longtime professor exercise and sports science a Brazilian YouTube Black belt Kia and a competitive bodybuilder and I have once trained in the same room as Even gotten a few pictures with a A Mr Sam Sulek and a very good friends with a Mr Chris Williams and they spoke recently and Got Sam's taken a bunch of different stuff, but especially Scott the video guy and I got our You know it knows this out for his take on science based training. Oh boy Nothing could go wrong with that Let's find out what he said Let's see how to make sense of it some Stuff we're gonna probably agree on and really even try to fan the flames around a needy some stuff that I have a slightly different perspective All right three two one Mr Sam Sulek What do you make of the World of evidence based lifting science based stuff at the moment? I think I think there's people who are gimmicky about it Yeah, hey Sam talk that shit babe. We out here though Scott you feel me hold up And make it a thing because they know it's like Because an older person or an older guy who works out he's gonna stick to the basics that he know works for him Which is you know sweet, but you know he's gonna be hard of him to accept new ideas So for a younger guy It's kind of this like Cloud mentality of like all on the new wave train, but some bits of little silly Yeah, there's definitely some of that going on there's a hashtag science based and there's a really bad way to do science based or evidence based training There's just ways to do it wrong like you can do old school bro training and kind of a glomerate all the stuff about bro training It was really good like go hard Challenger self at extreme ranges of motion Make sure to be strict with your technique don't lie to yourself That's all like Jim wisdom 101 stuff, you know like see in a lab you can hear that from the guys Or you could do all the worst parts of bro stuff which is like really weird partial rep ranges at the wrong parts of the range of motion tons of eagle lifting bad technique and consistent training and so there's good and bad ways to do bro stuff and just the same way as Sam is kind of Looting to hear there's good and bad ways to do evidence based science based lifting I mean a bad way is to basically It's got let's figure this out. What's a bad way find one Paper on PubMed that you don't have access to the journal to so you can only read part of the abstracts the rest You don't understand and you read the title and you instantly think that that one paper just tips the entire science on its head of what we knew before You just justify everything you can with that one paper and the justification is for training That's incredibly easy and incredibly infrequent, but somehow hashtag science gives you those mega gains even though You're barely trying Scott. How do I do that's pretty good? Yeah, but but Pablo at all said and then it just keep talking about that as if you don't know how I actually science works But we'll talk about what science based training is really really inclusive of just a little bit because I think I I watch to head and I've seen what Sam says I don't think all of it is so I'm not I would never The point isn't exactly what they're doing But a lot of the idea behind it and it's kind of its own subculture is It's very like it's a weird elitism It is a weird elitism sometimes with evidence based training and that happens kind of for a A few reasons one and anytime you get a little club people doing one thing and they think it's better than other folks There's elitism automatically the science based training has another level of elitism because it gets to be a form of intellectually elitism It's not for everyone to be able to or to enjoy Perusing studies watching nerdy videos thinking about a lot of stuff and doing much of math should like that So if you can do that stuff and you are kind of adept at it You can take an elitism with regard to your training You're like well, I'm actually thinking through my stuff and always other people of idiots and all other people might actually not Be some combination not as good as at science thing as you but also maybe they have different priorities And so And if you're good at science that doesn't mean you need to like raise yourself Moreally in the eyes of your own analysis above others So there's a lot of stuff that comes with that there's definitely some elitism that comes with that now in the other hand There is another kind of in group elitism for people that don't like science based training They're actually against it and these are real people on the internet and they post You know pictures profile pictures like no science based lifting over here brother and you're like well Actually you're proud that you're not thinking about things which again Usually those folks are reacting to the negative extremes of science based lifting the weird claims off of a single study the Very confidently kind of trying to just prove people wrong when you yourself the disprover has no muscle to Show for that kind of it kind of achy stuff about science. There's definitely a reaction to that That's also elitist so I guess that at the end of the day There are many groups in sports and subcultures like bodybuilding Which like to consider themselves better than others and in some ways they aren't and some ways they aren't it's usually better to stay balanced like their whole thing is this is right You are wrong and that's not even true because there's so many people that get so many different results Doing so many different things like the idea that their following is if I'm not perfect Then there's no point. Yeah, this is where you get into kind of the neuroticism part of it a lot of people who Not all but some decent chunk of people who are really really into evidence based science based training They really have a high degree of trait neuroticism as expressed and so they're really concerned For their safety they're concerned for the area kind of insurability of their results They're massive second gessers and they're very insecure and it's okay. That's why I always as well. Let's lift right Scott Pretty insecure Maybe I'm not you Scott you're good you were always an alfamale and I just lift for fun to just clown on the rest of us I just left because big dogs got it Big dogs must eat Scott how are big dogs can suppose to maintain their body weights if they don't eat you tell me or occasionally how at least In securities a thing and then evidence based folks will be like if I just get these variables perfectly if I Pretend my way into thinking this technique as they exactly the same ideal technique for everyone if I count every half rep and Exactly try to guess RIR I will be able to control the situation of I must have growth so perfectly that I the input output system is almost one to one Now that's that aspiration which is a very good aspiration We should all try to become as much the engineers of our bodies and much less the artists in the vibe sense art is great But in the you're not certain what you're gonna get if you do a certain thing not ideal We should definitely be striving for perfection But pretending you have perfection already and attaching yourself to it is a very different thing than striving for it and knowing that it's In perfect the entire time there a lot of people in evidence base space not all of them But a decent chunk of them basically will try to do this monotonous robotic thing because it makes them fill it Feel it ease that they're doing a thing that is super correct and a lot of times they they close their blinders off to other ideas Which could be wrong and often are but could be right and so as an evidence based science based think you're at your best You should be thinking with an understanding of what probably works best in doing that most of the time But then also an open-mindedness on the margins of like hey this this other idea It seems like it could work let me try it instead of poop pooling it right away because it's not super hashtag sign and that's the the demand of being able to explain it with studies because You know Don't into the gym at all is kind of uncomfortable It's always like a winner people gonna watch me working out. I've never done it. I'm uncomfortable because I've never actually gotten experience doing it It's it's something where it does have it inflated kind of situation you don't get nervous back going into a freaking Starbucks, but the gym is a little different because it has that physicality Scott the last time I went into a Starbucks as I was pronouncing that order my pants unbuttoned and fell off Everyone was laughing at my tiny crooked folks There is still more video to come but if you want a longer More extended uncut version of This video and many others and tons of science stuff we have members area click around check it out click on things It's a bit of money for a ton of bit of value all right back to the video Why don't you just go ahead and tell the people you're go to Starbucks order that you order so much all the time? Oh, I love it. So I was actually working with I'm not supposed to talk about this We were doing a bit of work with Starbucks because I'm a really famous person And very important and wealthy I might add I'm incredibly wealthy I just want everyone to understand that It however wealthy you think I am it's more wealthy than that and that formula does apply no matter who you are give that some thought and so I was like listen Starbucks I want my shit when I come to your coffee shop I want my order. I don't want whatever order you think the average American I'm not I'm not the average American I raised my voice like that they were like Mike Okay, what do you want? With your trillions of dollars and I said look honestly it's not that hard I need to go pretty heavy sometimes in training But at the same time I have high reps that's as well because I trained for hypertrophy. Is there like okay? Okay, write that down and someone just start scribbling right like one other Scott, you know the assistant girl She's just a bit like I don't even know she's making any letters She's just like shitting her pants because it looks like chicken scratch and They're okay, okay, okay, I'm like so what I would really like is a really supportive belt Not designed for powerlifting which can be great for a few reps But it's really uncomfortable to wear for sets of 10. It's either too restrictive or not form fitting enough I want to be able to unclamp my belt loosen it a little bit walk around the gym clamp it again Every time slightly differently depending on how long in the workouts been what exercise I'm doing what offseason or pre-contested is Totally adjustable belt that also cinches my waist together He gives me 360 degrees of abdominal reinforcement So like an intramodomal pressure can be high, but not powerlifting psychotically high and I want this belt to be nice and thin Because I wanted to conform to my body. I don't want to have to be super uncomfortable and rigid bending over and stuff like that And they're like Sir, we don't even have a supply chain. What did I have the expertise to do this and I was like well Figure it out and they're like all right as they call it Versa grips and they're like can you guys make a belt and they're like What do you nuts and they're like please make a belt doctor mics here? She's pissed again. I think he's on steroids again In any case the Versa grips company has made the hyper belt and actually Jared Feather and I kind of helped design it a lot of it And you'll be able to buy it at some points. God. How do we tell people to go where to go? There's links on the screen and then the description. Tata Tata now if you can't get the discount code you can't get the Versa grips hypertrophy hyper belt then You can go to Starbucks and start yelling up people and I honestly recommend you do that in a fun and loving way I think in a way it's a little bit Bringing it down like I talked about either Raising to the bar or like kind of coddling yourself and making it seem like less of a thing If you bring it and you get serious you say okay the gym is full of guys who really get serious I'm gonna do it and I'm going or I'm gonna do these things which people said is the perfect way to do it and it's not you don't have to go that hard Or you don't have to do that much like things like that I feel is a lowering of the difficulty This is where pretend science and real science fork off. This is super important you guys There is an idea held by two groups of people that science based training is not as hard and shouldn't be as hard as Hashtag bro training or whatever regular real guy lumberjack who actually wins the Mr. Olympia training This idea of science training is way way easier lower volume less proximity to failure lower frequency the whole thing That idea is held by two groups of people one group of people is a small but notable Subsection of hashtag science based lifters that are doing exactly the things Sam Soil at Conchrist Williams and are talking about here's trying to hide from difficulty by pretending that science says Easy or training is better. I'm well into this group. I'm kidding sort The other group of people that think this are hashtag Bro split for life hashtag hardcore hashtag science and These people need to paint science based lifters into a corner of being pussies Because they like to pat themselves on the back for being hardcore warriors and since sometimes they have an intellectual and very Organ complex to science based lifters then they have to make sorts all sorts of Excusiness to themselves of why their shit is better So if I can't understand what science man is saying because I never really went to school for that long I'm gonna pretend science man doesn't train hard that'll make me feel nice the thing is Real actual science tells us what about hard a train and here we're gonna see a huge dissidence Real science in review after review after review says all other things being equal If you can recover go and closer to failure in each working set is gonna yield more hypertrophy than getting far from failure It also covers the fact that higher frequencies are almost better per muscle than lower frequencies You're probably gonna get bigger by steps training them twice a week then training them Let's say one so week Time and time again the amount of deloding that is needed for real world hypertrophy training is Usually much less than we actually think in study after study a deal at once every eight weeks or 12 weeks Accomplish as the task just fine and you do not need to deal it every three weeks or four weeks in most cases But it gets we're still quote unquote in the last little bit The amount of training volume per muscle per week like how many sets of quads? Do you need to train with to get the biggest quads you can is a number of the top end of which we have to get to reliably find and The top end of which sits almost certainly north of 40 working sets per week roughly to failure Every week for weeks on end to get your best muscular adaptations on a average per any given muscle if your whole system can recover from that sort of thing There have been multiple studies that show 30 sets of quad training is Better than 25 35 better than 30 40 Better than 35 and a few even that 45 to 50 sets is better than all the rest below Now that's what actual science says to sum it up really clearly Science says progressively burn yourself to the ground To test the very limits of your recovery and only when you start to get a little weaker and you can't keep up Do you deal load wash out the fatigue and go right back into scaling Mount Do you volume close to failure that's the reality of what science has said that is the sum of the summarization of science so far Oh, by the way Scott just to make a fine point of it So I science also tells us to get into deep stretches consistently and almost every lift we can which is a really uncomfortable right like It's the worst or what the To quote one of my friends would us down there in the deep squat that I need so badly that I'm going all the way down for it Do I get a house or some shit like if I get a free car like now? It's just a lot of pain and so that really is the state of the evidence State of the evidence is challenged the living kind of yourself way more than you thought was possible And if you recover and you're okay next time do it again accept a little bit more Science is shining the light of the training of the realities the most hardcore training shit that almost no one does is Actually the shit that grows you the most and a lot of people in the bro Community would like to pretend that that's not the case with science Composses all these doing these fancy exercises. Yeah, but what if the fancy exercise Who's a shit little force to the triceps for example and you have to do eight sets of it three times a week to get your best gain Not what you're gonna do your bro lift you're not gonna do that you're gonna you're gonna hang up your Mike men's Supposternal offense all jokes and you're gonna do one set every other five in days and whatever You're really pat yourself on the back because it's a really hard set You're really cried about your childhood. That's actually easier than doing at science centers So in reality true science based lifting is damn near the hardest to show you could do it's Unreasonably difficult check out the papers if you're interested But it's argued as an improvement of the efficiency It's nothing wrong with improving efficiency if you're running away from work on moral grounds and pretending to improve Infficiency that's bad, but in science you get both improved efficiency and the mandate to work even harder real science Not hashtag pop med bullshit, but for me. I'm looking at that as though like do you hate? Working out like if you hate working out then you want to retain where it's like one set of day Like the ideal well I guess the ideal would be zero sets Two things I'm gonna push back here There's a great point in here that trying to pretend science to do less a stupid however one set all out super hard Mike men sir like right well into the thick of the bro is shit in the world Go f***in hard brother Consented all the way to failure compound basic Ronnie Coleman during eights all that's the same subculture Pat's itself on the back for doing just a few sets Sam just by accident called them out that's not science based training Scott how many hashtag science based lifters have you seen advocate one set for a to failure or never ever? The bros often talk about f***in hard set one f***in heavy set one down set brother And then we change exercises or we leave it just doesn't take much you know you know your body Which they have a point there? Because when you get bigger and stronger recovery demands really start to sink, but the philosophies all kind of Ask backwards like in in their world. It's always there's a pill Sam you take steroids bro So do I man not accusatory we all into the pill the answer is all of the above we want it all I want to take the pill I want to train as efficiently as possible So I get the most growth per the smallest unit time But because I want to be the biggest I can be I also want to stack as many of those efficient training sessions as possible To get the sum total biggest stimulus I can recover from to get my most jacked We take the efficiency of science the quote unquote laziness of wanting a pill or an injection and the massive amount of hard work that comes with just providing a raw stimulus As science says I'm gonna combine those into a trifecta of doing efficient hard shit with drugs in the mix That's how you get to be the best that you can possibly be None of those are in contradiction with the other necessarily unless you actively saying now like a real Where it's you never have to work out again and this is where my bias could come in because it's not an objective Like I'm just adding to a conversation. I can't say anything completely objective But for my perspective like I like it in the gym if I work at took if I could do 20 sets and that was actually like pretty efficient and it worked That's what I would do but it's not because that's like I'm not chasing a maximum efficiency in a way. I'm half chasing like maximum enjoyment because I like I like to be in the gym It's a really good point You want to make sure that the gym is a place you come back to but you fundamentally even though it's tough sometimes Enjoy being at that's how you get number one results. You just keep coming back But just give this a little bit of thought One of the reasons long term you keep coming back is that you find that your work in the gym is Efectural it is yielded results for you that you're really like and they're still escalating now the ability to change your body and to something that you want to see it Look like Do so dependably do so safely and do it with a trust worthy system that you're always modifying a little bit But like with the RPI purchase FIAP for example, you either what I use I go in there It's got all my exercises all my reps already pre-programmed for me I just hit when I need to hit adjust on the margins log my shit that system gives me this like super warm fuzzy feeling that like I'm doing the more or less the right shit when I go to the gym multiply that by results I'm in see I've enjoyed them An efficient and effective system you trust and that leads to results those are the three things you need in the gym Once you get all three your you can go old and now there's ways to just get not all three You can enjoy going to the gym you can not have a dependable system you can still get results No problem But if you're more advanced if you're genetics on grade if you run into an injury or irritation that lack of dependable system Means you don't get the results that means the results go not so great and then you go searching for a dependable system like the RPI Perchography app many other great ways to train out there in order with which to at least Probabilistically guarantee yourself some decent results find out how your body works and adjust from there Of course if you don't like the gym at all You might not be showing up however if you have some grit you have a dependable system You don't really like the gym Getting the results might actually make you like the gym because you start associating it as a place where you succeed and you love the success And then you grow into liking gym what I don't want you guys to do is Love the gym Again in their and do call especially stuff you enjoy a lot at the expense of your results think about it this way What I'm going to do with the gym is this big circle is big universe of All the stuff that works really well, right and I'm going to take my little circle of what I'm going to do And I'm going to circle it around the stuff that's in this big works really well circle But I'm going to circle around the part that I like and sometimes might my likes shift I like low reps right now a few months later I like high reps a few months later I like my reps a few months later I like super high volume blah blah blah blah blah But it's all within the what is effectual that's totally cool Absolutely pick what you like out of what probably works according to science and experience that big circle When I don't want you guys to do or suggest you try not to do because this is going to be a failure point Is you have the stuff of what's effective and you're looked to the right of it and you're like what I What I like to do is right here it's out of what's the most effective? Both-soup ball band nonsense bullshit and you go I'm going to do that But remember are you in the gym to just do what you like? No It should be what you like but it's not just what you like because you could have stayed home and and consumed a Deleterodica over audio book Emily was tied up squealing like a piglet The William was urinating all over her face Wait, yeah, you could do that and all kinds of other fun things in the gym with their number one for effectiveness Stay with what's effective by science and your own intuition and then you can vary the stuff in there and absolutely do what you like But if you what you like is outside of what's effective. Ah, man the gyms probably just not the place for that Anyway, folks, I've been Dr. Mike and I'll see you guys Next time All right, that was fun guys if you're interested in more fun. Maybe you're having too much time to chill out or you click on this video and have even more fun Bye
