Bro, I literally got Alepysha from that shit. Damn. Being this young and taking random drugs, random dosy schedules is exactly as chaotic as it sounds. That. The End The End The End The End Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Anna Sounds' Periodization. I'm an exercise and sports science professor at Lehman College. And the co-creator of the RP Hiperchrophy app. The trend twins have a video on, well, drugs. Maybe try and even, definitely at a ballax, let us appraise their knowledge and see what kind of Brady score on the Dr. Mike's scale of Do You Know Things and How Well? Let's get to it. Today we're going to be talking about what it's like to walk around with the test of five men. Hey, I got the test of 10 men. I was born for a reason, the Jersey. Where are these guys from? They look sort of Italian. How from the Metro Detroit area? Maybe the Caldean? I don't know. The 10 men to army with the height of one man. Look at the width of four. Hoping on steroids, it's a lot like you get a fast car here. You know, she comes stock pretty fast. But you want to add some f***ing horsepower to that baby. This is the brahashi I'd love and I'm here for all day long. Car analogy, which you guys know I love. So if we want to mug in the gym and we want to mug on the way to the gym. Mug. Mail of the group. DRIVE from Amog. Alpha Mail of the group. Because an attitude in which you are the superlative. You are the Omega Wolf. You are in charge and you have a lot of confidence. And if you want to have a lot of confidence in the gym and for other males of your generational age to be impressed with your level of confidence and really feel your swag, I assume that sequence here is going to be be jacked and beyond tons of steroids. So you can feel like a confident person. And there are certainly other ways to getting that. This is a sure shirt. One of them. The absolute machine on the gym. The menace in the gym and menace on the road. Karen's yellow and I'm here and it's getting mad at me because I'm taking my shirt off. I'm looking like a sick bastard. That will buy. Okay. So we're in the gym now to make Caucasian women in their 40s upset. Karen's excellent. And on the road he's also a menace, which I assume he means he's encouraging danger of striving. So far the trend wins seem like just reckless guys. If I got the kind of dangerous, I kind of want to be around a lot. Not in their game, but like, you know, just kind of like, hey, Joey's like, hey, I know you. Hey, whoa. Like Greece, the whole movie. You want me to tell you, bro, if you're going to take steroids, you better have some f***ing in same patience because me and Mike, if you're not, if we just rage, I have zero patience. These guys are so f***ing honest. I love it. They're like, hey, look, you want to take f*** steroids? You need f***ing patients, which I don't f***ing have. They say they rage a lot. They're also assumed about 20 years old. That's, and, and my scale, about five years too young to be doing steroids or public service announcement. If you're in your teens or 20s and your early 20s, don't do steroids. You got a lot of national gains up the head. There's all kinds of really crazy downsides of steroids. They probably make you less intelligent over time. That's fun. And they destroy your health and they make you angry and anxious and prone to bad decision making. That's all good stuff. If the trade office were good, but up until you're about 25 years old, you can make such crazy natty gains and you're brainest on the churring. I wouldn't recommend you to steroids. That idea, but if you do have patients, which is absolutely great advice, and these guys have seemingly don't have it. What I don't have in patients, I make up for f***ing biceps. F*** out of here. Any inconvenience I'm going to the gym I'm getting upon. If you don't agree with me, like, I'm going to punch you in your face. If you don't agree with me, I'm going to punch you in your face. Yeah, that definitely how you can feel on steroids sometimes. But don't do that because there's a place for people to punch people in the face when they don't agree, it's called jail and you don't want to go jail. It's a bad time. The first thing about steroids is you have to be realistic and be self-profile. You think that you're going to just randomly spawn in muscle? That's not how the shit works at all, they're true. Steroids do works slowly. They just magnify how much gain you're getting from sleeping and eating and training. They don't magically put muscle on your body. F***ing. I love it. Thanks, guys. For a lot of us now. It takes time. That's worth it. This shit just doesn't happen over f***ing night. It sure doesn't happen over f***ing night. And also over night, two different concepts. And it's, it's steroids is like the American dream, okay? It's all fun in games until you got to pay taxes. Is that the American dream? It's all fun in games until you have to pay taxes. I think if you budget appropriately, you can see that coming. But I think he's going to say there's downsides to steroids. I hope. Let's find out. And those taxes is your f***ing nutsac, your liver, your organs. You're f***ing ass respect. That's all true. We've done our time, Nadie. Done our time. It sounds like prison. I did my f***ing time. Natural. Well, f***ing years up on Samquattin. P*** terrible. We trained actually for eight f***ing years, man. Eight years of natural training is good. But if you started when you were 11 or 12, you still should be using steroids when you're like 20. I don't know how a lot of all these guys are. I know. I have Nadie, actually. Accuades, okay. That's a good flex. Hey, hey, remember when Mikey was Nadie, some guy in the back of the gym was like, yeah, it was a total f***ing freak. That guy scared the f*** out of me. Day one time, he pulled the f***ing knife to my face. And he was like, oh f***ing Nadie, you want to stand? I was like, well, of course you are, buddy. Hey, it changes your body composition. You mod a car. You go for f***ing 500 horsepower. And then you're getting a thousand. I love it. Guys, the gains are instant. But you go from 500 horsepower to a thousand horsepower just by buying a new car. Which one of those analogies is more accurate? I'm wondering. Most of the cars stays the same. There's a few components that are f***ing changing in our bodies when you take gear. See, one thing would be your f***ing load. Yes, your hormones do change when you take extra hormones. That image isn't ever going to be the same. Even if you're PCT, you probably will not have the same normal levels as you had in worry about them. If you do PCT, there's a very high probability that you'll have the identical hormone levels before you have them. So that's actually not true. Honestly, taking steroids is kind of like cyberpunk. You know how when they're adding in all that cyberware and shit, they go into cyber-cycosis, handle the f***ing power. That's how steroids are. I'm not going to lie to you. Of course, everyone knows about cyber-cycosis. I live in that state daily. The mental side effects, they're all real. They're all got cyber-cycosis. You can, yeah, they can manage like a motherf***ing. Mental side effects are all real. Thanks, fellas, for letting us know. For real, that's, that's an important thing. You're so dedicated. I was already a hard worker. I had the f***ing grind dedication. For this shit, and then you add on all the other shit that's going to take it to the next level. It's like your hyper-focused bro. Yeah, you got the blinders. You got ton of vision. All you can see is a f***ing goal. I mean, huh, it's steroids who make things more intense in your head. I don't know if they improve your focus as much as the guys are saying. Then again, I have never been on that much of try to go to the court. I'm just saying humble. I try and recognize my goal. See, I can't even process it. Well, Mike, you're saying he's all over the f***ing place. That's not wrong. Stairheads do occasionally cause you to be alone over the place. And like he said, psychosis, mania. My ass cheek f***ing hurts. Oh, man. It's a little about the process of taking steroids. Bro, it is so f***ing scary. One, the shit that you think you're getting bro, like it's all watered down. Yeah, you don't really know where you're getting ever. For sure. Since the 70s, you should not farm a grade anymore. I mean, how much can I say here without laying my cards on on the table? You can get farm a grade gear. It's not that hard. But, uh, young fellas like themselves, they're learning some good lessons to do at bathtub shit. So I won't get them their way. It could be oil, sir. It could be a random f***ing shit in there, like. Yeah, listen, this is great advice. If you're just buying random steroids from random guy at the gym, f***ing a f***ing, you know what you're getting. For sure. The crazy part is a lot of the early beginnings of steroids. You literally have to learn about it through other people's experiences. It's like a science f***ing experience. You learn from f***ing Reddit. Yeah, got to go on a go on a lot of Reddit. Seriously, I want to hop on. You have to go through like, brother, you're going to coach. Great advice. You, if you're going to use antibiotics if they're legal in your jurisdiction, if you're over the age of 25, you've made all the right trade-offs and choices. Doing it with a coach and ideal with medical supervision is absolutely the way to go. If you just read about some stuff on Reddit, you take some pills. You got shipped from India three weeks ago. You know, it could go very well for you or it could go not very well. And I would not suggest steroids to anyone unless you want to be a, you want to take your shit to the next level. You already have your training, your f***ing diet together. Absolutely great advice. Don't use steroids until you have your training and your diet and everything. Really square it away because then for that super boost, you're in the right position to accept it. But if you're just using steroids to get to some place, you would actually successfully get to just looking like you lift. And then people are like, oh, well, you're drug free. I have so much ahead of you and you're like, well, actually, no, I'm already on steroids. Instead of putting in the effort on food, on quality training and on restroom relaxation, I put it into drugs first. That idea.

Whoa, we're young guys. We're 22 years old. 22 years old, two early for steroids. All right. If you watch our old videos, you think, okay, yeah, these guys look like they're 20. Now I look like I'm f***ing 25. I mean, you do, per se, bro. Oh, should we got beef? We failed in time and time again. And we're trying to get it right, bro. And we just don't want people to go through that, you know? Even on prep, we're going through failures. And, you know, it's just a learning process. Prep? Are they doing a body to lead show or a powerlifting need? It's one time I looked up the estrogen blocker I was taking. Bodybuilding show I think, a fresher blocker. It's said breast cancer treatment. That's how f***ed up this shit is guys. I'm taking breast cancer treatment. So I don't get f***ing rest. I thought I was supposed to take that shit like, you know, every day. You're supposed to take it once to twice a week. Bro, I literally got Aleppysha from that shit. Damn. Being this young and taking random drugs, random dosy schedules is exactly as chaotic as it sounds. That get a coach, folks. And these guys are great because they're saying, don't do this, get a coach. Yeah, that's okay, every day, like my hair sort of fall in love. We had a lot of hair left as far like until. Big part of why we were talking about this now is because because like we have the experience one now and I feel like it's our duty. And now we have a whole healthcare team. Damn, they have a healthcare team. TikTok's doing you good. If you guys are familiar with more plates, more dates. Course, more plates, more dates, who isn't. It's like the most humble, like, guy in the fucking internet. Is that really true? I wonder. He's literally the godfather of steroids. He's broken down every little bit about him. He's the godfather of steroids. Folks, Google Dan DeShame and about 20 other people. I'm way before that, but less digress saying, Unkind things I will continue. He has his parent company called Marrike Health and they've started sponsoring us because through this prep because we knew we were going to hop on more. Gear came to our bloodwork before we hopped on more. They literally came to the house. Well, what can I say? As far as leading by example, this is of course terrible. They're way too young to be using. They've made all the mistakes using. As far as lessons they got from it, now they're in contact with Marrike Health to take care of their health. Have a team around them doing things in a logical manner and knowing that they had done some stupid things in the past and teaching the folks about it, I largely approve. This is quite good. So I'll say this. It's I can't really rate this video. It's better that they made this video than if they hadn't. That's approval enough for me. All right. See you guys next time.
