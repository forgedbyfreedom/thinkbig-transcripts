Slash, slash, slash, slash! Slash! Slash! Slash! Slash! Look at the size of me! Look! Whoa! Folks, what's up? I'm clearly an accumite for our free strength. This is Thor. We're going to train arms. I got a whole lot more to say about that. We're also going to train chest and Thor is enormous. And why is he so big? Why is my ego crackling? I'm going to walk off and try to feel big by myself. Let's go workout. Let's go. So what's the rest of the period? Do you want to do like a bodybuilding rest or strong man rest? Since a training was your training me? Yeah, I'll do whatever you say. You tell me where's your warm-up, how many reps you tell me to go again? Where's your start? We'll start here. Put those down. Let's get the 30s. Let's start with the 30s. And we'll talk you through the technique. It's very, very special technique. Let's go. Why are you out of breath? Why are you out of breath already? That's it. Larry wheels. Show me what your dumbbell press looks like normally. And I'll walk you through the modified technique. Very good. Cool. Okay, stop for a second. Have a slightly bigger arch. Push your chest up more. Very good. And when I want you to do every time, this will be easier with a heavier dumbbells. This is the goal is to get the inside of this dumbbell here to touch right under your front belt every single time with a pause. And so you're not going here. You're going out here. And you're going to take a one-second pause at the bottom and then come all the way up. Give that a shot. All the way up. And then nice and slow. Perfect. Just like that. Very good. As deep as you can, really stretch at the bottom. Yes. Today, everything is about the deep stretch. This is boring. How many are you doing here? Are you serious? More. You don't warm up. Oh, go. A five more. Just five more. God damn it. Sorry. Sorry. You got bored. You're going to make it really bad. The camera on my head. And good enough. Perfect. All right. All right. And then you can just chill for a second. But the next weight we're going to use is going to be 60. Let me do a quick intro. Just relax for a second. Paste around. Maybe stare down max the editor boy. Yeah. He loves that sort of thing. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Dombell presses. Who is a really strong, he can do dumbbell press anything he wants. This isn't just to move way around. It's to make sure that chest is doing the predominant amount of the work, getting all the good muscle activation and getting good hypertrophy. We're going to be doing sets of about 15 reps here. Thor has evolved his peck before. So we're not doing anything crazy with low reps. That would be really stupid. We're going to be nice and slow and controlled. And if you want maximum hypertrophy yourself, this is pretty much how you do the dumbbell press. Excellent. Good stuff. Next will be hundreds. Sounds good, my man. How you use the rest of the ingredients? Absolutely. Max followed him in there. Let's see the cock. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? Why? All the way to outside of the shoulder. Yes. It's going to feel weird. Good. Slow around the eccentric. How does that feel? Good. What's your best dumbbell press results for reps in your typical style? Well, when I was on my feet, my best ever. How did you get for some reps in claim? Lately, I did 150s for 12. Quite comfortably. As a public stay humble, since you're doing some, you know, I see we're going more outwards. What? I do. I go more down. You definitely feel like strength. Go fast down when you change your training method from strength training to more hypertrophy. Yeah. How many reps here? One rep shy of failure. One rep self failure. Big chest at the bottom, chest at the top, chest at the top, chest at the top. Good. Ah, I thought that. How many reps did you have for life during the team? Probably like a 25. I'm joking. Well, honestly, not many. Not many. One, max. Okay. My good one. Come on. Okay, max, not the more swing. I had a lot more left. Well, I'll have one left. Seven. You're going, must get 10. Big slow. Big slow. There you go. Out. Now we're rolling. That was really good. That was really good. Next time, when you finish the last rep, pretend you're going to do another one and ride these centric down. Then, rack. That extra little bonus. The centric at the end will give you a little bit more growth. Because honestly, though, I didn't want to say this to you. You kind of scary in real life, but I see you're cool. You need to get bigger. So it's falling into a pulse? I mean, like the conversation starts at 500. You won a stronger span, that's cool. You're not going to get thrown. But are you the heaviest man of all time? Does that harm you at night? Yeah, does. That's right. I might miss your life. But I'm not even slow. Two more. Slow. Slow, slow, slow, slow. Slow. Just kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm done. I'm alive. I'm alive. Look at the size of me. Whoa. There are the ever like just like randomly during the day, looking at the mirror. Holy shit, I'm big as. Especially less than a while. What am I like? Yeah. What a naked. Less than a while. Who you're hooked with me? Holy shit, man. Yeah. It's nice coming to boosters or how it's more alive, which you live massive all the time. That was the play, right? That was the play. Mine's a cure, dude. I think I have a bigger action. Yeah. If you had bigger raxia, the rest of us would be really serious. Oh, how is this? When I was younger, I'm not joking. Sheer's not. When was younger? I was doing myself in the mirror. Do you 200 kilograms? I think like, damn, I'm more, I'm not joking. Yeah. That's serious, bigger action. I'm not sure how did you get over it. I don't know. Good, quite a question. Just, just, just been big for a while. That was a good question. The most small thing. Let's go around. Reality. It's like, where am I? I was wrong the whole time, right? I am big. Yeah. Good technique here, Thor. We are going to do eight repetitions. And remember that last one. Slow. Wide. Rage. Good. Two more. Good. Good. Two more. Good. Two more. Good. Two more. Good. Two more. Slow. Up. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Two more. Oh, my thing is acting, but this is real action. That was good actor. You are a fucking good actor, dude. Oh, shit. No, it's not acting. You're real. Proof, look at the shot. I've wiped the sweat off of my hand twice, and I still sweat on there. Yeah, it's the last breath, yeah. Oh, we're here, guys. Oh, we're here, guys. Um, if I was to ask you for like, that's just sounds weird. A bottle of your sweat. Would that be like weird or is that like cool? Cool. We're totally normal. Would you like it before? We're called after work, George. Oh, it's different formulas. We're called. You're called. Nice. We, uh, another brand is like, you become aroused. And then they collect your sweat like, free no, the special nights with your loved one. See, my arms are so, you're pumped. I, I've hard time to stand here. Ugh. It's not funny. Oh, yeah, literally. Oh, my God, my arms. Just take the one scoop is hard for me. Oh, I'm in pain. I'm in agony. Mama. We just get started. Yeah. That's exercise number one. Let me just, two minutes. My arms are up to you. All right, folks. So we have deficit pushups up next. Deficit pushups are awesome. Because they're super safe. There's nothing wobble. You can always just rack with your body weight. And they get amazing, amazing stretch. But here's the thing. Oh, I'm troll that easy, central. As deep as you can looking forward and up is a really good. It expands your chest and let's your chest take more of the load. And we like to do is take a nice one second pause at the bottom. Come up two thirds. Never letting the tension go off the muscle. Sums up them at tablates. It gets the faster twitch motor units active earlier in the set. And it's really just painful and terrible. Push it just fun first, home safe. We're going to do four sets of these. Probably you'll either know how many reps Thorough can do. 10, 15, we'll see. And we'll get after it. So yeah, let's go. Perfect. Good. Wait one whole second at the bottom. Full pause. Good. Again. Full pause. Full pause. Beautiful. Just like that. Keep going. Five more. Slow. Three. Four. Three. Up. Stand up. Up. Up. Help. You're okay. Stop man. The only possible thing for this is the nose of a mop that my wife is cooking. Really nice lungs. So I'm just almost thinking about that lungs. Yes. The scent there. I'm going to have some chicken lacks. I was gonna rise. Ooh, we're going to wait for those. Yo. Yo. What? These assholes made me try fermented sharp. You know it would be really funny. What if you did it a set? Oh, sure. Let's go. How long it was? Two. Do I get the food or something? Let's go. There we go. There we go. Let's go. Let's go. Ooh. Deep. Four more. One. Two. Quality. One more. Thought let's go. No. Beautiful. Two hundred. One whole second there. Yes. Good. Three more. One. Two. Control that eccentric too. Control control control. Good. Oh, there's nothing left. Beautiful. That was awesome. Got shipped. My skills. You. Good food. Do you have juice? Next between size. You have chicken or chicken or steak? I came like empty handed. Damn. I have a self. I have a self for. Four more. One. Two. Look forward. One more. Four lockouts. That's it. So far. I feel destroyed. But the same time happiness. Happiness. Instead of my heart. Like I feel like I have a. I felt. In a long time I slept when I was my son daughter and wife. Now I feel closer to my close-known-over. And I feel. Some sort of intimacy between me and him. So nice feeling. I love you. I love you. Oh. You know, I wasn't running away. Thor still rated a train. So we have Scott Crusher's next. Remember this is chest, triceps and biceps. Scott Crusher's are second to last movement. These are barbell sculptures that are awesome. We're going to have Thor try to touch his chin. He's so gigantic. His arms don't actually bend that far. As a deepest possible elbows in all the way down the control, with full lockouts every time, should be fine. An effort extra extra mean. We'll superset them to close group bench. But I don't know. Feelin' like that. What do you guys think? Um, write it in the comments. We'll take a time machine and we'll modify this on the other end. Slow control in the center. Yeah. Full pause at the bottom every time. No rush. Every rep is its own. Slow control keep those elbows in on the way down. On the way up I don't care. On the way down, elbows in. Falskrip. Three more. elbows. One more. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. There he goes. There he goes. It's funny how, uh, it says a light weight, it's just so hard, but you know, yeah. Good job. Yeah, thanks. I didn't do any. Uh, try some pump. Yeah, maybe we'll say some. Like it. Ooh, the feel, the feel like, like, I said, are diamonds. Oh, is that a wee bit? Okay. I need that. Ah, ah. Mmm. It's a shortcut. It's a shortcut by your children. You know, you know, you know, a broom for your own. Approved 100%. Uh, I usually have my intro work out also delivered by children. They know not to come. Uh, uh, we have five sets of this total. Matter of fact, you ready? Let's go. Shift. One second pause. One whole set. One whole second with the bottom every time. I'm not.
