Chastop. Chastop. Chastop. One more. Go. Don't swing. I'm in a fucking bicep pro lead. Enough with the drama. Slow. Chastop. Chastop. What's up, YouTube? Me. Today woke up, hoping I was someone else. Nope. Still Dr. Mike. Jared Feather wakes up every day, covered in his own actual life. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. I'm not sure if he's going to be a good guy. But this was, you know, the best guy in the gym was a good guy. When I was in the gym, I saw a guy in the gym. He was like, hey, I love your stuff. Follow you guys, lob, lie, or two normally two, and that stuff out. Cause, you know what I'm saying, a lot of people come up to me and say Mike. You're saying change my life. I was like, yeah, whatever I drank them. Then he took a shirt off and flexes by his steps and his back. And I was like, what? And they showed me a picture of what he used to look like and I was like, huh? These crazy transformation. We all know that there are two rewards for an insane transformation. One is the reward of just living an amazing body, which you now do. Two, I'm just gonna get to train on the RP channel and get put through a really psychotic back workout and wish you had never had a transformation. Bring them come through to me. Sounds like a nightmare? I love it. Let's do it. So first exercise is gonna be assistant pull-up. Read as 250 pounds and we wanna make sure that he is able to do enough quality repetitions to convey good stimulus. That means minimum is sets of 5 to 10, but we're gonna focus on the quality. So he's probably gonna be doing sets of 10 to 15 in the assistant pull-up. Four sets. That means a lot of stimulus. Pay attention to the technique cues here because they can change the assistant pull-up into an actually super effective exercise. Versus just pull-ups for which you get help more on that later. Let's get to it. Big stretch. Keep forceful. Let's go, good stuff. We got it. Set me up. Uh-oh. Two more. Come on. Good. One last one. Come on. As high as you can, I can throw all these time. Four, four. Slow. Big stretch. Unwrap. Good stuff. Hell yeah man. This is your last set with this grip after we change grip. Yep. And it will give you a little less weight so you can get a quality contraction. Let's see if we can get good technique here. 5 to 10 reps. Okay? Come up as high as you can for a split second. And then control the defense. Keep stretch. Yeah. Yes. Hold the defense stretch all the way down. Now. Yeah. Set. Yes. Two more. Come on man. Get height. Slow. One last one. Nice and easy. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Two seconds stretch at the bottom. Beautiful. Oh my god. It's tough. Oh man. Good bump now. Yeah. Bro. It's hard. Hard. Reded two sets of slightly higher position. Normal assisted pull up to normal grip medium grip. Now he's going to do two sets with a slightly lighter weight knowing from a hundred pounds of assistance up to 145. He's going to do the parallel grip. He's going to get a bigger range of motion slightly more repetitions higher so it's a downside. It's actually a similar just slightly higher number of repetitions to get more volume and a little bit of grip variation. That's going to be four vertical pulling sets. We're going to be done with vertical pull. We're going to go in and do our rowing to make sure that all of the general areas of the back get hit. This is like a great overall back workout. It's going to be a total of eight sets of back that is high quality. Awesome number sets. If you train your back two times a week, even three times a week, that's a great amount of volume to try with your own program. You have a big chest here in the sound. Yes, yes. One last one coming up. Oh, shit, you got another one. Hold two stretch. Hold for a second. Let it pull you apart. That's it. Slow, slow, slow. Stretch. Unwrap. Hell yeah. Oh shit. Good shit. Good shit. Good shit. I never thought the old lady machine would be kicking my ass. That's what people think about it too. Yeah. It's like why would I use that? What do you show? Good effort. Yeah, the thing you said about like getting injured from those sets in the past, I assume you didn't maintain that strictive technique with stuff in order to mean. I'll try too, but we need to get to a head point. Right. Just don't allow yourself to eat that point. Exactly. And you're just the same, but no injuries. So you'll grow a shit load, but you won't have those shitty overuse injuries. Really? Like when you heard your back on bent rows, I don't assume they were touched the ground nice and just come up slow, you know what I mean? No, it was literally. I finished my head and I thought that's not fun. You can eat that shit, right? I thought I could eat out two or three more. Exactly. That's what I did it. Exactly. Yes, you just don't let yourself get to that point. And you use the Rubsim Reserve method. Right. And you can just monitor your volume and that capacity. Quick tip for the assistant pull-up in the lighter sets. You'll see that what Reed is doing is pulling weight above chest height. So he's pulling all the way down to the nipple line. This not particularly a lot of cool muscle activation, lats, et cetera. There's not ton that happens between here and here. Except it sets us up to go so high that you can engage eccentric resistance to the descent phase higher, which means your muscles get crazy. Accentric load all the way through a huge range. We essentially like are creating a bigger glass with which to fill with eccentric overloading milk. I don't know where I was going to go. You guys get the idea. If we pull really high, we can engage early, really turn the lats on and slowly control for big stretch. It meets every rep quality. You just don't have to do that many reps if the range of motion is really big. It's not the way to train. That's a way to train. Give it a thought on your own training. Pull nice and high with low handles. And then on the way up, don't just drop. As soon as you pull, lock in the lats and slowly let the machine peel your part, you will feel a stimulus. Slow. One more. Big power. Come on. Come on. So last one except big stretch before, pull stretch. Up. Oh no. Slow. Rack. Oh, Jesus. Oh my god. Never gotten the shakes from a pull up. Oh, what the fuck is that? Are you doing more at this grip? I'm going to have that with you last day here. I think we're going to do flexion rows next. Okay. I mean, no those are. Yeah. Okay, dokey. So four sets of assisted pull ups are done. Now we are going to do barbell flexion rows with re. The target of the flexion row is the entire complex of spinal electron muscular, which are as well as all the other pulling muscle, which is the big thing here is to maintain a rigid position. Then flex at the spine. And as you wrote, extend when touch for a split second hold after tummy. This is going to light your back on fire. If you've done tons of other back movements already, even if it's just one, this rounds out all the back development and really gets you super cooked up at the end. Give it a shot. If you go light, which we will, that's a 10 to 20. It's super safe for safe for the back. No, don't do 400 pounds of exercise right away or ever. And then you won't get hurt. This is going to be a good one. And do you guys ever know like you're trying to do your job at work? And so much as standing next to you, breathing heavy. It's annoying. It's a public gym people cover up not everyone wants to see goddess body, whatever girl you even wear in a bra. Don't answer that question. Let's get some fun. Hold. Slow. You can come up higher. Archer, hold back. It'll be easier to hold at the top. Come up. Go. Row and lean. Yes. And then slow. Just the same way again, Reeve. And just the same way again. We're in it for the long haul keep going. Boom. And then slow on the way down. Big stretch. That stretch was rushed. Slow. Stretch slow. Gentle touch. Up. Big chest up. Yes. You've got to stop at the top. I swear to God, we'll cut this video off. Let's go. Big moves. Yes. Three more in your dug. Big move. Slow. Stretch. Last one. Big chest. Go. Slow. Rack. You are. Jesus. I have you as 70 pounds I've been in my life. Isn't that crazy? It's just a work in the club industry. Yeah. It was a hustler and then crazy horse. The reason that girls never come up to the table that I'm at is the strip club. Is it because I'm ugly? Is it because I smell? Is it because I have bad breath? It was because I look for. Or probably the money asked. It's probably his money. They told where they think they see money. Okay. What do I have to dress up like to look like I have money? Segar. These at watch. Done. Done. Yeah. Choose. Not over-tode. Not open-toed. Yeah. No man. No man. When you're rich enough you don't need to. Screw. I bought those. They were the toast. People carry you. Or shoes. Yes. 100% why am I trying to walk anywhere? Two days. Stretch. There you go. A couple more. Reef. Big chest. Slow. Control. Arch. Oh. Yeah. One more. One more. Huge moves. Slow. Stretch the arms. Stretch slow. Stretch. Stretch. You don't feel that all the way down. Oh yeah. Upper back. All the way down through the back. Name a part of your back. You can't feel on this exercise. Oh no. Beautiful. You don't have to hold for that long but that was great. Again. Yes. Stretch. Big chest. Look forward. Keep your chest up. Yes. Just like that. Again. Yes. Two more on your done. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it at the top. Bring it to the stomach. Up. Back to the stomach. Yes. Slow. Hold. Slow. Slow. Slow. Don't rack. Hold right there. A little lower. Rack. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Like gosh. You can do barbell curls. Yeah. Does her elbows or anything? No. Famous last words. Same as last words. Same as last words. I don't know. Back is over. Reads back is crushed. His biceps could use a little bit more. A lot of times what Jared and I like to do is at the end of a back workout. Just a couple sets of biceps. It's not a ton, systemically fatiguing. Biceps are a high frequency, very easy recovery muscle. So if you're able to train biceps twice a week on their own with some other muscle groups here and there. But if you have a back workout, you just put two or three sets of biceps at the end. Maybe some higher matching. Maybe a drop set on the cable. It's a really great way to pepper in more biceps stimulus because you can never ever have big enough biceps. We all know this. Check out the cues that Jared is going to be giving to read how you execute even a regular barbell curl is a big, big deal. If you want the most lunge cavity for your training and to get the most stimulus out of a small amount of weight, Jared take over. Pro forward, elbows forward and in. Right here. Push them in a shit look. Feel that. And then lower from right there. Keep your elbows here. Lower. All the way down. All the way down. All the way down. From right here. And then up. Leave your elbows up front as you go down. Okay. Force them in towards each other as you curl up. Almost like you're doing a twist curl with a dumbbell like this supination. Keep your chest up. Yes. No bullshit. It's supposed to be hard. Good. Slow. Get those elbows in. There you go. Go. Good. Slow. Chest up. Chest up. One more. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Chest up. Chest up. Up. Good. Force those elbows in man. I'll buzz in. Chest up. In on the way up. In on the way up. Go all the way back down. Stretch. Now you've got to try a wrap. Chest up. And then. And then. Down. Slow. Down. Rock. That was good. Jesus Christ. Oh. Oh. Oh. Man. The more strict your technique is. The closer to failure, the biceps get sooner. I say. So you don't have to do as much. So just really keep your eye on the dry. I lose my technique there. Just really try to keep in mind. Fuck the wrap count. You know what I mean? You get eight. We get the shit. Yeah. I know this is perfect. We don't need to count reps. But ideally. Like we're using our RP training app. We want to count reps to keep track of how we're doing week to week. So the reality is first don't count reps. Just focus on technique. But the gold standard. So is to focus so much on technique that you can still count reps. His every rep is perfect in every rep counts. We don't want to not count reps because we're like some of these are bad. We want zero bad reps eventually. Of course, just the first time training with us. We're sticklers. A few reps are like not to our liking. But over time, you want to become a machine. Like when I train with Jared. Jared's a machine. Every rep looks the same. Every rep is flawless. And if you can't get another rep, it just doesn't happen. So there's no fearing of getting the failure. It's something that happens. It's awesome. But we're going to only ever get the failure because we demand so much of our technique. That at some point you're just like, No. I can't do that. Most people would like this. I was like push her. I was out. Yeah. That's how we get to the end there. I'm like. Yeah. The purpose is not to complete the rep. The purpose is to execute the technique. The chest. The chest. Yes. What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh. Elbows in. Slow. No swinging. But chest off. Full stretch. Full stretch. Oh no. That's it. Rack. Rack. Yeah. I got up at those like, That's not a set. Oh no. I'm like that. It has to end some time for everyone. No one can keep going. Do you know what? Yeah. Dude. You're lunges. Good stuff. I want you to tell YouTube folks how this work out went. Part of eight sets have ever done in one workout. Yes. She's. Yeah. You did phenomenal. Your masculinity is disgusting. Yeah. And you shouldn't be around children. Okay. But. But. But. But if you were, the children would have something to look up to that was Hulkesque. Yes. And that's what's really important. And that brings us to the mission of our channel.
