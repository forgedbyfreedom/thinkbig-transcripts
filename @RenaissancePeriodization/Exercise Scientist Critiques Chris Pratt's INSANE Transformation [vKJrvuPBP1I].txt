Start off with squats for your legs. A new jewel for Hollywood. Andy here's going to show us some good squat technique. I've never asked you for much God. Just this once. Let things go well. F***. F***. F***. F***. F***. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Anastonspirodization. And the creator of the RPI Purgeur Fiat and a professor of exercise and sports science at Lehman College in the Bronx. And today, Chris Pratt is on the menu. Oh no, I saw that a little wrong. In any case, we're going to see what his training looks like and maybe even what his diet looks like and use our crazy RPI expertise to see if he is awesome. Me or Kim Kardashian. Let's get into it. I have a good time. Duffy Gavre. Looks really jacked. First observation. Second of all, Duffy is not a real name. What's your real name, sir? Mike Bob Jim Eric. Duffy is a last name. Maybe. I'm kidding. It's a fine names, sir. Let's find out what you know. CrossFit coach and trainer. CrossFit coach and trainer. That could either be really good or really bad. I wonder. That worked a lot for Marvel. Some of the slubbries I've trained in three grads. Hit. Who we strained Brad Pitt? I've done things with Brad Pitt's picture that you could call training because they're physical. There's a lot of sweating, a lot of having a puffing. My forms are pumped. I have a lot of guilt. Toby McGuire. Toby McGuire. Delicious. Straight. Aren't I? Canning Tatum. Channing Jesus. All this dreamboat express. Duffy. You have a real name, sir. I'm jealous of it. And you. Chris Hemsworth. Chris Hemsworth. Oh my. Lord. This is, this is guy is like, I got. He's just got the dream job. That's what the fuck I'm doing with my life sitting in a fucking YouTube studio. Damn it. Oh, the joy hasn't. Scarlet Johansson. Scarlet Johansson can stay. You feel me? Even though I'm on my gay vibe right now. Black widow or whatever. Sure. He could be any color you want. Chris Brad. Today I'm with you. Alright, Chris Pat finally. The person we're talking about. When I started training Chris regarding to Gallic. He had just come off a roll where he got the tickle of the out of shape. Oh yeah, those Chris Pat pictures are him out of shape. No, when I see them and he's like kind of confidently showing it off. I think in a study is like, I'm a fucking multimillionaire famous person. All of you who gives a shit. Could you imagine coming up Chris Brad? Like man, you look like shit. Like yes, I'll just buy you out so you never say that again. Got it. Okay, I guess you're in my life now. His transformation on his effort is huge. He's a dedicated guy. Dedication and look at those pictures. My God. I think one of the misconceptions about how to love his train is that it's different than how you would train. I wonder how those misconceptions come to be when a fucking men's health puts up celebrity training videos that are pure nonsense. But when you think about it, a lot of people in the gym actually also train in a purely nonsensical style. So, Duffy may be correct on both grounds. I guess it's true to say that just like regular people, some of them train like total shit, and some of them train quite well. Let's find out where Chris Brad is on that very short spectrum. Dr. Z's getting in shape has to do with going in Boston, Yasin, general. So I'm going to take you through a quick full body workout for the getting shaped like Chris and other eyeless actor. Duffy's like, I don't like being on camera. Get it out of my face. I'll just say minimally what I have to, and I'm not going to smile about it either. Dope, that was a real squat. Start off with squats for your legs. Unusual for Hollywood. Almost two effective, two direct. And here's going to show us some good squat techniques. Okay, he's a cross for coach. I'm expecting these to be good squats. I've never asked you for much God. Just this once. Let things go well. In that. We want to keep your chest up. Get your butt down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Duffy. My man. Keep the back nice and straight. That's about as perfect as they come. Yeah. Ladies. There's no better way to improve your legs or rear. Very important to get your hip up under you and completely open it to top of the beach or have. Check. Check. Big green fat check mark. Amazing. Next. So my favorite back exercise for building thickness in my clients is one on dumbbell rows. So any is going to show you how to. Right. It's done. Duffy tip. Use as much weight as you can handle. This is very not Hollywood. This is awesome. And the technique is great. Big stretch at the bottom. Control the centric on the weight of the bottom. Touching your ribs at the very top. Oh, man. Duffy tip. Keep back straight and stick butt out. Again, agreed on all counts. This is just good old hardcore. Great technique lifting to get jacked. Damn. No wonder Chris Pratt is an amazing shape. His trainer is the f***ing man. His trainer and my job is to be a guy. He said my job is to be a guy. I thought for a second he said as a trainer. It's my job to be a guy. I can't. Now we're going to do bicep curls with bar. Yeah. Barbell bicep curls. I f*** love it. Hardcore awesome classic movement. Works super well. Amazing. This is great. Probably the single most efficient way to build arms. That guy's arms are pretty big too. So another great exercise is the dumbbell flies. Very old school. We've got a perfect example of dumbbell flies. The dumbbell fly looks great. She's controlling the eccentric. Nice and slow. Low pause at the bottom. Excellent. No critiques. Now we're going to do some bench press. Which is about as good as you get for a building chest. Bensh press is one of the best exercises for chest growth. Pause. If you don't like it if it hurts your shoulders or whatever, it's not the only exercise that goes to chest really well. There's tons of others. But if you can get a big peck pump and a big peck stretch and your shoulders and elbows feel okay. Barbell benching. Barbell benching is amazing. And it built the proponderance of my peck size. Do you guys have a walk around the mall or something going out to eat? You just have to check on your peck to make sure this still there. I can't just do that. I can't do it. I'm good. I'm good. It's a bad dream. Like a nightmare. Oh no. And they're gone. I start crying. I wake up crying. Every other day. Alright folks. If you liked that video, you might like the extended edition with all the nasty stuff we can't say on YouTube. Cut in. The member section is yours for that. Give it some thought and maybe you can join. Also works there. Look at that. He's touching all the way down. It's as if Duffy actually knows things. Amazing. Hollywood. You should be training with Duffy. If you're not, you should be training with Duffy. Do you have another trainer? Fire them? Go to Duffy. Your trainer's pretty good and you love him. Pink slip and his locker. Your fired Duffy's my man. The fun delts. Try it. And you're going to. Wait wait. What's your trainer's name? It's Duffy now. Do you have perfect technique? Because that's what you know. This is excellent technique. You'll notice these retracting shoulder blades. He's lifting his chest up. He's slowly controlling the weight for a nice pause. Right at the actual chest itself for a deep stretch. And then he's returning in an athletic way all the way to full lock out. This is wonderful stuff. These folks are really, really lucky to have Mr. Duffy as a trainer. And it says Duffy tip. Do not bounce bar on chest. Perfect. Why no bounce? One is you're needlessly causing traumatic stress to your tissue. And two, debouncing makes it easier. You want it harder at the bottom. I'm not easier. You want to use muscular power instead of. Reflex action. So now we're going to go over the ab mat. Sit up. You just want to bring your back. Go down far enough. You don't want your butt to come off the floor. And then back up. That's great. The ab mat sit up allows you to get into a great degree of Expinal extension. This stretches the abs. Put them in a mechanically deseptant Tages, but also very muscle growth promoting position. And then you can curl back in. Get the full range of motion. This is an excellent exercise. And for most folks that just want to get in great shape. This is kind of all you need for abs. This is awesome stuff. There's not a single exercise here yet, which is not a great exercise. These are all great exercises. All taught very, very well. And if you want to copy someone's training in Hollywood, Chris Pratt's demand because Mr. Duffy isn't his corner. And then down. Oh man, they're holding at the top two. And control the eccentric. Music to my ears. That's one version of a full body workout. The important thing is less the workout. And more about what you bring to the workout. You're really a desire to just put it again. Bringing your A game. Dope. Although the workout is important, Mr. Duffy just takes for granted that he knows things and isn't the f*** idiot like most other Hollywood trainers. Want to look like an A-list actor. Then you got to show up and you got to train hard. If you're easy, everybody's made sure. Again. F-H-1. Thank you for still existing. Alright. This is actually Chris Pratt doing the one I'm wrote. I suppose Duffy perfected for him. Not bad. I would like to see a little bit more eccentric control. But otherwise, very good. Okay? Those are the world's worst pull-ups. Duffy, where are you at? Your boy's f***ing up. No full stretch. No reliable range of motion. Just not a whole lot for the back to be doing here. I would like to see assistant pull-ups are pulled-out and if Mr. Chris Pratt's not strong enough to do some real actual pull-ups. Actual real pull-ups, the good kind. You stretch all the way down. Big stretch at the bottom. Let everything loose and then come all the way up. Getting your chin roughly around the bar. Even up higher if you want. Oh wow. This is a news clip. Pumping up. Chris Pratt does push-ups at the gas station. There you go. Those are terrible push-ups in the mid-range of motion. I have no idea why he's doing them. Somebody drugged test that man and it's not for steroids. For psychoactive drugs like mushrooms or acid. Maybe even like day three of meth. Sometimes you just gotta get a f***ing pump though. It must be really weird being a Hollywood celebrity. Because like, everyone kind of knows you. Like, the guy back there is probably a f***ing Chris Pratt. Aren't you? I hated the f***ing guardians movie. I hate what you do with the script. I don't write the script. Hey, shout-up on f***ing talk. And you listen anyway. What you should have done is told that one green girl. You know, this has to be a daily occurrence. In the view of work with Chris, you mentioned at the beginning of the interview that he was a little on the heavier side when you first met him. First of all, I can hear a f***ing mid-Lens accent from England any f***ing day of the week. A country. And it... When you started actually treating him and what went his fitness levels like and how did you go about improving them? When he did zero to 30, I think he dropped down. I think he dropped probably 30 pounds or so. 30 pounds is a lot. Poor that role. And that's his hard work. You know, we cleaned up diet. We got him on the intermittent fasting hours. You know what I'm fasting works just fine? We have a few videos on how to optimize it if you'd like to click through. It's cool. It's not going to be ideal for preserving muscle perspective because your body likes to feed relatively often on protein in order to well have protein in its muscles. But not the worst thing in the world. So I did something called intermittent fasting. And I ate from noon to about 6pm. That was my window to eat. New into 6pm is a curious time when to which to put your feeding window unless you're going to sleep early. Why? Because typically you can fall asleep better if your stomach is full of food. Especially in a hypocoloric fat loss diet. So if you go to bed at like normal even time, which is generally clear or sort of 11pm, it's 5 hours without eating. That's right when you start to get really hungry and how the fuck are you supposed to go to sleep. I would prefer the intermittent fasting. Feeding window to be from something like, you know, G4 to 10pm or something like that. And what did I eat in that time? What did you eat? Mr. Chris Pratt. Pretty much just healthy boring stuff. Healthy boring stuff. Some fucking honesty on Hollywood. There was a lot of chicken breasts. There was a lot of lean protein. A lot of vegetables. I might have like corn tortillas with some eggs. A lot of avocado. Good clean healthy fats. Tons of coffee. Black. Lots of coffee. You're not a big diet. You want the energy. You want the focus. You want the appetite suppression. Coffee is great. I like it cowboy. You know, I drink with coffee black. Yes. Yes. There are many ways to be like a cowboy. One minor one is to drink black coffee. Do I copways or don't for that I suppose. Since he was playing a seal, you know, it was very important to what I call being combat shape. Interesting. Let's listen in. You have the movie look in, you know, ripped up and shade. But we live. The seals were on the go so much where we don't have a gym everywhere we go. Accurate. You know, a lot of times we only have a set of dumbbells. And there's times where we don't have that. But you can use the find a place to do pull ups. You can always find a place to do squats. You can always find a place to do pushups. You know, and so that's really what we adopted for this training. It's kind of interesting. You know, typical special forces operators don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger so Vester Stallone. Those are more like bodybuilder looks. They actually look like fit and healthy men. And they're often like pretty lean. Though sometimes not super lean. They have some muscle, but not a ton of muscle. They're endurance capabilities are really high. They can sprint really fast. They can jump. They can do pull ups and pushups and stuff. That they're really the thing they're paid to do the most is put your side on target and pull the trigger really fast. And then re-analyze the situation and do that over and over again. The fitness is a little bit secondary and they're absolutely not being judged in that physique. So when the movies have like action stars with pop delts and bicep veins, you know, no offense. But he's still looking at the f***ers. Like this, not what a special forces operator typically looks like. Real operators are typically quite a bit shorter. Usually way something like 180 pounds instead of like 240. And they don't look exceptional externally, but when shit gets popping, they're going to kill you. Did you actually work on his psychology in order to make that a replica essentially of what a seal would go through? And working on this psychology pretends psychology is an actor. You can't get hard enough like a seal unless you go actually seeing live combat after you successfully pass bud straining. Let's see what this gentleman has to say. And then yeah, we have those conversations of you know, really like, hey, we don't have to do this. We get to do this. Like this is something we get to do. That's a really good point. You don't have to do this. You get to do this. Working out is a technically a leisure activity. It is entirely voluntary. And if you're having trouble motivating yourself to work out, understand that it is a privilege. You get to enhance your health and your quality of life and your appearance by doing something that also enhances your psychology and your pain tolerance and makes you happier at the end of it. So don't try to push yourself towards working out. Think of what working out really is. And it'll pull you towards it. You'll want to do it. There is no avoiding hard training if you want to grow. But if you want to grow the most, your training needs to be hard and smart. RP hypertrophy app will make sure you're progressing on track, monitoring and adjusting your workout at all times. So for all that work you're doing, you can be sure you're getting the best results. When I was a, Oh, f*** man's health. On Avengers and he had so many superheroes together, they all had private chefs and I was like, hey, let me get some of that. And so I got into him's words chef who could be kangaroo. What the f***? That's awesome. Kangaroo doesn't taste that good by the way. After two days, I mean, look, my arms are half the size of his. I can't believe that I would eat five cheese burgers for lunch. Oh my god, that's a lot. Holy f***. He got fat the old fashioned way just from overeating. Now I lived in like a constant state of, oh god, for a good sick of eating so much. And that was happiness at that time. And now it's the exact opposite. It is nice. Eating junk food is very pleasant. We have to recognize that fact. So I can't say I was happy doing that, but now happiness is eating clean and getting lean and stuff. Now eating is boring, but the times between eating, I feel great. Whereas before eating was fun, but the times between, I feel like crap. Yeah, f*** that. The first transformation of my body to become starlose, was the hardest because I had the furthest to go. I was about 200 pounds and never. Oh my god, he was almost 300 pounds. Holy shit. That's a tough journey. He said something interesting. The first transformation into starlode was the toughest. And then after that, much easier, the first time you lose a ton of weight or put on a ton of muscle will be the most difficult. And if you ever gain some weight back or lose some muscle, getting back to your previously attained state is a way way easier. So if you've been fit before, but you've kind of slacked recently, don't think it's going to be as hard to get back your fitness as it was to get it. It's going to be much easier. So get back in the gym right now and get on it. Uh-oh, cheat meal. Periodically, you got to treat yourself with a cheat meal. Don't do that. Cheat meals are stupid. And I have a whole lot to say about it on this channel and on the videos. If you just search my last name, is Rital, and cheat meal, you'll get at least a few videos saying how it's not a good idea in the context of a fat loss phase. So once your fat loss phase is over, and you've achieved your goal, cheat meals go lower. But until you've done what you need to do in that phase, 8 to 12 weeks long, a fat loss dieting with hardcore training, cheating is just going to set you back, and it's going to make plugging back into the diet harder, because you're going to just want to cheat more after you get that first little sniff. Bad news. And so for me, it's deserves, man. I go to my mother-in-law's house for Sunday, family dinner, and I just go crazy on the desserts. And that's everything for me. Yeah, if you go crazy on that stuff, you can game like a pound of body fat in a day. And if you lose a pound of body fat in a week, you can see how one cheat meal a week, even. Cheat meal. Cheat meal. Cheat go crazy with desserts. Can really set you back. And I do about seven days worth of damage. Accurate. Amazing. And I take about seven days to pay that off and end. Get right into it. Oh. Seven days of damage. Seven days to get back into the groove, and then damage again. All right. That was interesting. So on the diet stuff, totally fine. Again, two things. Intermittent fasting is not ideal. If you want to make it more ideal, you move the window up closer to the evening. Maybe have a few protein shakes or protein only snacks through the day. That's even better. So the diet's okay. The training as far as Chris was demonstrating some of the videos out of the deal, but as far as Duffy has instructed, phenomenal, wonderful Duffy. For now, has our best trainer we've ever had on the celebrity. Hollywood workout reviews so far in that title will remain his until on the last somebody does better. So on the training. Hey. 9 out of 10. 4.56 out of 4.98. Make sense to that. See you guys next time.
