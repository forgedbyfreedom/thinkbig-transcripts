We don't just want to beat up on a concept and See yeah, we want to beat up on it and say okay, this is what we learned and here's how to make your Better training even better stone so The myth here is people do this thing with dumbbells and I'm sure you've seen it before they take two dumbbells out They press the dumbbells off of chests. I'm going to sit there and they will Press with one arm until some number of reps is achieved and hold it and then they will press the other with the other arm And then when they finish they're rack both dumbbells and So there's wait hold on a second what's the myth like that clearly happens the myth is that this is a good idea Okay Well hold on a second we have to cut it some slack what kind of slack can we cut it? How to be honest with you guys when I had this topic come up and I We decided to make this video I go through when I have a template just you know the myth the good the bad and the real talk and I sat here and thought about how this could be good for a Little bit of time maybe more time than usual and it still came up with almost nothing What did I come up with well? It didn't it builds an interesting and cool looking skill it's kind of funky and Need to be able to like I symmetrically hold something and then press something else things that's kind of neat And it might transfer well to some activity that occurs like that It um I did think about this for a little bit and nothing came up. I'm not that smart though And I'm gonna round the world and see no whole lot of sports So maybe there's something that you do in parkour or some shit that does exactly that Nothing comes to mind. I'm sure maybe some of you guys can hypothesize in the comments below and then The other thing is Maybe it's cool to bring up just like one pack or one delta one tricep because one arms is symmetric that doesn't cause a lot of hypertrophy The arm that you're moving actually grows and You can use the thing is if you said okay, I have a dumbbell and I have a bench and And I want to train one arm only with presses you can't just take one dumbbell out of the rack because as soon as you press it you'll fall over So by having this dumbbell in your hand Even an extension if you like it allows you an auto balancing so for that it can work Later you will see why other other many very many better ways to do this so What is the bad number one is the Alternate arm gets as the French say and since I studied in France for many years colony expert I will use some French today if you need to turn on Google translate I'll wait All right, a litiart as the other arm becomes a litiart So you start out with your right arm and you do ten reps the entire time that you're doing that You are isometrically holding a weight here and that tires out the tricep front belt and just And so when you're done pressing ten reps with the one arm You move on to this arm and you may get something like five or six reps Unless this arm was 20 or RIR and then you can do both There is a way that if you start with your dominant arm Sorry, you're non-dominant arm you start with your weaker arm you can get them to balance out more But you need to have a hell of an asymmetry for like 45 seconds of isometric fatigue to equal reps And the quality of those reps after you've tired your systemic abilities out here Then you have to hold this out and do this None of the arms are really getting a good workout and especially that second arm so There's not a whole lot of antibiotics stimulus that comes from isometric especially locked out isometrics Like if it was mid range isometric your muscles would have to work harder But it's really like loading the joints and the stability function in the muscles and your nervous system for paying attention to that This just not a lot of growth that comes from that and not a lot of strength and just got down it not a lot of anything kind of sucks The next question is what the hell is the benefit of this versus just a two arm press like normal And the answer is not much if any now it is really true that there is something called a bilateral deficit When you produce force with both sides of your body Technically speaking and is in at least some cases you can produce more force per half side if you don't work with the other half So like you can single leg press often more than you can two leg press times two or divided by two So if you can double leg press let's say 500 pounds Typically you can single leg press maybe like 300 pounds So that doesn't add up because it should be 250 but because you're not using one leg Your nervous system and your focus can be more on the other leg and you can actually push more with that side Um However, this tends to happen almost exclusively in highly stable scenarios the way they demonstrate this in the laboratory Is they literally tie you to a fucking single leg leg extension machine and then you do a single leg where the whole machine is Holding you in place and you can really just grind into one leg In this scenario it almost certainly wouldn't happen and when ends up happening is depressing with the one arm You probably won't get anymore reps with that one arm versus pressing with two arms and except getting double the benefit and half the fucking time So in this case it probably doesn't do anything anyway, and is thus not a great idea And you could say okay, but there may be a situation in which if I really like this exercise I'm practicing for a while I really can get it to be stable and I can grind a couple more reps out with each side Sweet that'll only be in the first set because then you'll get so tired holding them and won't happen in the second third and fourth sets after But even if that's the case if we're training for hypertrophy and muscle size Then why would we want marginally more force production? Anything in the five to thirty rep range and they can comment and force you have to generate to get those kinds of reps There's already roughly equivalent for hypertrophy anyway So if you can brew so a little bit more force like why don't we just produce a little bit less force and Two more reps There's just no good reason I can think of that you would do such a thing and if you say well to hold on But what if we're training for strength? Well if we train for strength then you want a super stable situation So this is completely ruled out for strength to begin with so it's like a Bad for strength for sure and then we're like, but what about hypertrophy then it's bad for that too So it doesn't make a ton of sense now here's the thing there are better alternatives to doing this and that sort of critique number three First of all you can just take the dumbbell and Leave it on your chest for the non-moving arm it'll rest on your chest provide the same counter balancing And you can fucking crank this one out without having a fucking detired hold on the other dumbbell out for no goddamn good reason And then when you switch you put this dumbbell down and then you go with the other arm it's weird It's wacky it's still probably stupid, but at least it's better than holding it out at extension I'll tell you later or why I think people do the hold out of extension, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense There are many better alternatives if you do insist on training in a lateral for your packs or try to try Substant shoulders, which is maybe a fine idea Yeah, I will say for those of you curious and at some point we should make a video about this Unilateral training in general is insanely overrated five-perjury of strength and has some uses in Sport performance and carry over, but it's just it's much more a parlor trick than anything that is useful It has its uses I'm not insulting it, but it's not this magical thing that everyone needs to be doing And I'm sure if you you two right now Everyone needs to be doing unilateral training. You got a hundred fifty fucking videos by people who are mostly wrong If you do insist on unilateral training and there are good reasons to do it There are like a trillion better ways to do this one of them maybe the best is a hammer strength press machine and you have the hammer strength presses You can load the same weight on both sides You take one handle and you grab it, but you don't push it out you just grab it so that it stabilizes you and then with the other handle You do as many as a fucking process as you want Then because you wasted almost no energy holding that handle because it was just static and you did not even lifting the weight It's still on the fucking support you can grab this and then do this Problem solved you don't have to do this weird dumbbell nonsense for no reason whatsoever It's tough. This is a tough one because I'm trying to cut it so much lack and it's no slack coming out What is the number one reason that people do this exercise my gentle hypothesis Is that is dumb shit they learn in high school football man? That's just what they're doing football because you got a hold fuck man a bat and you got a puncture way through Whatever stupid shit that people justify to themselves is way too much specificity and way too little overload It's not something you should do in the weight room the way you make better football players is you get them to take Debench press and increase it by however many percent is possible and then they just the rest is football technique and handled in the actual On the football field training with offensive line coaches and stuff like that and you all you need football players to be generally strong And generally explosive you don't need to do one arm at a time crazy fucking bullshit another thing the reason why people do it is it looks cool And it maybe a little fun to balance it's definitely not boring. You know, you don't really do so many dumb Expressing the gym and turn like I need a little change and sometimes people change to this and You know it gives you attention at the gym There's always some like jackdoo dude played football at a relatively high level. It comes to the gym and it takes the 90s And he presses them both they're like all right and then he just goes like this and someone's like dude You do in that with one arm Holy shit. It's not thinking it through so there's definitely that but I will say this If you want to be jacked You do shit that works You don't do shit that looks cool but clearly just doesn't make any fucking sense. I will say If you can rationalize this if you can steal man the one arm at a time dumbbell press while you hold the other arm in extension Please do so in the comments and I don't mean that facetiously I mean seriously like I'm on a no-bun I don't hear about it. I want to hear we have to say and if you say some cool shit I'll I'll holler I don't give you props and if you say some stupid shit I probably won't say anything at all Or just be it that we're all say dump shit every now and again. Maybe this video stupid Maybe there's a magical reason I didn't think of That's the case hit me up in other words Bye shit link subscribe biotech talk box wipe whatever people say. I'll see you guys next time
