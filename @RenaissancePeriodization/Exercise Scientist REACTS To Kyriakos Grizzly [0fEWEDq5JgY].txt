Hey folks, Dr. Mike here. Who am I again? Her faster of exercise and sports science at Leeman College in the Bronx in New York City in the World War II of the rest. And also co-founder of Renaissance Predensation and co-creator of our suite of hypertrophy apps and training apps. And I do have an admission to make for you today, to you today. It's an uncomfortable admission, but I think in today's trying political times, fans sitting won't work anymore. It's time for me to take a stand. And I'm going to take a stand by admitting something to you that is uncomfortable for me to admit it. Because every day I fight against it, I am mortal. It's tough. And I am not a god. Now I'm doing everything in my power to engineer my way towards God like a mortality. Why do I tell you this? Because among us walk the immortals, not just the blade, trinity vampires, I'm sure they're around to vampires alone. But true gods, heroes, men of whom word spreads in only one of two ways. Way number one, whispers, I already see here. Chalice whispers, rumors, he's real. And the other way is screaming at the top of the lungs, during and by said female in an orgasm experienced by her to the very thought of this god and or if she's a very lucky direct physical experience. Like, what the f*** are you on about, bro? Oh, but you already know. Because you saw the thumbnail didn't you? There are men and brave men and capable men and strong men and there are gods. And Kiriakos Grizzly is a god. I'm not just because he's Greek, but that does hurt. You guys remember Hercules? I don't either. Because a strongest man ever from Greece is f***ing Kiriakos Grizzly. Scott, the video guy, roll that shit so we can just do one thing together as our little YouTube family. Bask in awe. Let's do it. Oh my god, yes. Oh god. The scale says full. You see, folks, that is because how do you weigh godhood? You shatter at its presence. You drop to your knees. Men from fear, women from the kind of inability to contract their lower bodies, I assume is concomitant with a full body orgasm. Ladies? Turns out, this is a dating tips episode. If you are a woman of reproductive age and hey grandma, don't tell anyone I said this but YouTube, you're going to want to take notes because I'm going to tell you how to make yourself most available to, I was going to say, a man like that's not true. A god like Kiriakos Grizzly. So more dating tips ahead. First, if you find yourself a man that steps on the scale, let's shit short circuits, I'm not Beyonce, but throw a f***ing ring on that shit. The rumor is that that was a 200 kilograms scale and I think he was like 200, 12 kilograms when he stepped on this. To 12k, that's like pushing 470 pounds. That's not a man, let me speak of. I love everything about it. Also his body composition, I'm no sports scientist, but I would say he looks to be about 8% fat. I'm in a conversation for 10 to 12% for you, Nasehers, but like anything north of 1415, you're out of your mind. And honestly, just jealous, I don't understand. Understand. Look again, seeing this kind of perfection is difficult to wrap the head around. You've been lifting a while, you think you're swollen on, you're kind of, you're a little f***ing small tea, your pecks are kind of popping, you're like damn dude, I'm out of my f***ing stare. I don't even know about it. And then you hear the mere mention of Kiriakos Grizzly and you realize you haven't trained at all. A chile, you are a child and so am I. Look at me, I'm Giriakos. I mean f***ing big titties, even if you're a straight dude, which sure I am. You can't resist the shit and obviously he's jacked and his beard is on point at 100% I can do this, I can do this. F*** yeah, hell yeah. I don't know what the f*** that is, but it looks dope. I imagine it to be a shrug, done in a way that is designed to maximally inconvenience the setup. Notice that he has tape, clear tape, packing tape around that number of 25s. These are 25 kilo plates by the way, it's real weight too, you can tell it because the bar is bending and he's got little chains there for some extra weight on top, he's nurturing it, which means he's holding into the crevices of his arms and he's doing a elbow shrugging, pecks, poppin, shoulders, juicy face that bloat 100. This is debate, like what is masculinity? That debate is over, you're looking at it. You want to be more like a man? You put a picture of Kiriakos Grizzly up in your f***ing bathroom, which should already replace the picture you already have up with him, just a new laminated version, and every day before you f***ing walk out of that bathroom that you brush your teeth and shave in and touch your body in the shower too, you tell yourself, Mr. Kuyakos, I will not let you down, and I will try to become much more like you with every single thing I do, starting with seat and zershush rugs. Some of you may be asking, or he seems quite tired from that, how come? I thought he was a god. Ooh, good one, folks, but you're not that clever. Scott, you grew up Christian, yes? Sure. Scott, what did God do on the last day after he created the heavens on the earth and man? Rest in my God. God's rest, folks. 40 chests. Kiriakos is playing with you with you f***ing pussy's out here. You know, we're all fighting demons in the gym, and because he's a god he's fighting like the devil I assume or multiple the devils, sometimes you got so much shit in there, and I don't mean clogged arteries. I mean demons, that even a hard set of, well frankly, whatever the f*** that was, just isn't enough to get it all out of the soul. So after you rack, you've got some shit in there still and what better to do than primal screen. Like guys like f*** yeah, I've no idea why I'm celebrating what happened in that range of motion exceed one inch finally. Okay, honestly, that flexibility is f*** dope. I can't do that shit. He somehow incredibly obese at 470 pounds and also wildly athletic. What? Oh damn, I also hitting the body building poses at it. When I would just say, and I've listened, I've been really fat myself before, comical body fat percentage is, well, God like. Because you could say to yourself, if I were this fat, there's no way I would hit body building poses because it would be embarrassing and I understand you as a mortal human, because I am too unfortunately, that makes sense in your head logically, except what to be embarrassed about if you can never die. Good morning with bar dump for no reason f*** re-racking it. Partial bent road deadlift combo. Oh, whoever made these videos is having a grand old time. Now, TPH unless this pick is enhanced, he looks like he like, of course he's a body fat very high, but you know, you don't get traps like that from body fat. And delts and packs and arms, curiosity must have learned on the other. And I mean George Clooney is good looking, but this real men, as we say in Russia. Oh yes, nothing like bar carries. Oh, and I love the angel wings. Some of them having a lot of fun at carryoccuses, either expense nor benefit. And you know, like, they got one thing, right? He's a f*** angel, right? Can you imagine you're like, you're some little kid, I don't know man, this is going to get dark road quick, but like your parents are fighting in the other room and you pray to God and you're like, please send me an angel to help me out of this. And I just want to be in a safe place where I feel safe and get a good night's rest. Amen. And then like the door bust open and carryoccuses, like you pray for me. Yes, I am carryoccus and you're like, why yes, sir. These are Texas angel wings through the door. If there's fall everywhere, he's like, come with me if you want to. You know, I don't know whatever. In any case, you're going to have a good time. Holy **** shit. Now like full stretch pull ups with little left lettuce system coming up over the bar with a chin at f*** 400 plus pounds is impressive. I think a real talk. Carryoccuses, Grizzlies, lifts are insane and weird and probably not very effective for the amount of fatigue they generated and excessively laborious to set up the gym situation to have them done. He's big and strong and athletic and it's a trip like God damn it. You're not supposed to be a move for an f*** pounds of that. Well, don't you go to Walmart next time. Pick someone out who weighs 400 should be easy and be like, hey, how many pullups can you do? They're going to be like, I, yeah, come on man, that's not nice. Carryoccus, he's your man. There is no avoiding hard training if you want to grow. But if you want to grow the most, your training needs to be hard and smart. RP Hiperchography app will make sure you're progressing on track, monitoring and adjusting your workout at all times. So for all that work you're doing, you can be sure you're getting the best results. Yes, I am an explanation for the Stuntler AMs still assigned to us. Most people understand that weights are an adamant objects and that they can you don't understand your emotions because if you scream at them, nothing's happening. But maybe that's true. And maybe it's just that the weights do understand at a requisite minimum intensity of screaming. And Kiriako has screamed hard enough directly at them that the weights usually are like, what? Huh? And this time, Kiriako says, ah, ah, and the weights are like, oh, no, yeah, but listen, handshake, I know exactly how you feel. Thank you, Kiriako is for letting me the weights know what you're feeling on the inside. And he's like, yeah, you're respected. Just want to be on the same page. You guys know people dogless birds. They can talk to dogs and shit. Kiriako is a weights whisper. And that's why he's the strongest thing that's ever been. Oh, he also seems to be yelling at the heater behind him. Maybe if the callers to sometimes you just got to let it out. Uh, ladies, imagine that. Kiriako's grizzly exists. And I want you to remember that for a second. I want to reach out to all the ladies who watch the channel, the three and a half of you that are our fan base. And I want you to be truthful with me right now, not even me. And then the quiet and piece of your own, ask yourself a question, are you having the kind of sex that you want to be in it? Like, is the sex you're having like, oh, thanks honey, that was great. You're so sweet. We'll kiss and then turn to sleep. Or is the sex you're having? A cosmic, calmic experience of full body clasps and releases that leaves you drained and confused in the shower for 30 minutes just staring at the bottle of shampoo barely able to amulate in your own two legs, wondering how can someone put out such good, god damn loving? Well, if it's not the second variety, there's a problem with an easy solution. The problem they're having is your second is mystical. And the reason is because you are not having the sex done to you by Kiriakos' grisly, ladies, let's all close our eyes together and imagine that f***ing chest hair rubbing up against your face as you gasped for the tiny little bit of air. He decides you get to have to keep you just awake enough to just disintegrate into a pile of pleasure beneath his 474 rhinoceros like pounds. Am I a racked you ask? Yes, and I have been for this whole video. Hey guys, if you desperately need more videos of Kiriakos grisly and you've already run through all his other stuff and you'd my incisive commentary to go along with it, we've got an extended cut, so that could be cool if you were a member, just saying hit that subscribe button slash membership button and I worked button just do it. Pause. Ladies, I'm making a hard cell. I know. I'm a bit tired of time or like, but like, why don't I add his abs? Like, I need a man with abs. Bitch, look at him doing crunches. Girl, can you do crunches when you're in 470? I didn't think so. I guys got abs as an abs, got abs. And those abs have abs. Unfortunately, there's about a phone book that's there. If body fat between that shit and the skin, but nonetheless, he's out here working. There is an unbelievable amount of ASMR value. There's something cathartic and soothing about watching Kiri Akras Grizzly just exist. He posted these videos. These are all of his channel that he posted first. Or whatever. His team is team. He gave a few members of his team. I liked the bunny hops. It doesn't seem like he's trying to get max altitude. It's like a Sumo squat jump also partial. Kiri is. You know, like, oh, you pray to God back in like the freaking Greek days with Greek gods of real and shit, like whatever, 3000 years ago. And like sometimes they be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, here's a good harvest, but sometimes they're like, ah, sorry, this volcano blew up and killed everyone in the f*** village. The gods have been described as Mercurial in nature. That is the perfect description for Kiri Akras Grizzly. What sense can you make out of these little, little, mini squat hops? Well, let me ask you a question. What sense can an ant make of a design for a quantum computer? None. It's orders and orders of magnitude outside of its cerebral capacity to understand. So when we try to understand what Kiri Akras is doing, and you think, oh, I've got to watch it, Dr. Mike video. A laugh at Kiri Akras to go, he's so silly. He does he silly things. Weir silly. He's not silly. There's a method to what looks like madness to us. Oh, f*** yeah. I thought I had full range of motion on my upright rows. Holy shit. This is called fiberase is overhead of 10 times 100 kilograms. I mean, look, it's an absurd lift for seemingly no purpose. First point. Second point. By the way, 100 key is basically two plates on a side, less like 225, to 20. If I see him on the f*** man handling, to above head height, 220, 225 in the f*** gym, I'm not f***ing that guy. Kiri Akras could pick up a grown man and just throw his ass aside. F*** that. The guy that his crew is amazing. The guy behind him is like, yep. This is another day, another day, another dollar. You know how we tell you on this channel a control the descent to get the most muscle grown. Apparently we're wrong. The clap is incredible. There must be some sarcasm baked in these guys. Oh, Christmas colored weights. Let's see what's going on. Oh, we've seen this exercise before. This is kind of not so much load for Kiri Akras. He's had even more before on their hanging. The gut really comes in handy for this. Trust me, I have a gut. These lifts are easy when you have a gut. If you don't, you're not really a man, so it gives a shit. F*** yeah. Not a terrible movement for various forms of athletic development. His profile view from the side there is sexual. Oh my god. Oh my god. I didn't think the shit could get any more absurd. Behind the back momentum wrist curls with straps on. Again, I reveal my mortality and small brain didn't this with the question of why. There must be a reason I simply can't comprehend. Oh yeah, little bar partials. He's like, okay, okay, I'll go down a little bit further than the third of the way down on this last map. Dumb victory. Hey, that's like Randy Coleman used to do. The way I would describe his lifting is if you wanted the minimum muscle growth possible for the most joint pain possible and the most inconvenience and lifting possible, this is how you would do it again, you because you're not a god like your eocons. Is he wearing jeans? No, no, those are sport pants. This is where I'm supposed to grade it, right? You guys ready for my grade? What about of 10? What I'm right saying next will be the end of the video. Consider that my statement out of 10. God is real. See you next time. If you guys liked that video, YouTube thinks you're going to really love this one over here, so give it a click and go down a fantasy, k-hole of endless YouTube videos.
