Up! Three singles in your dump, one at a time. The f***s low. We only count the good one, Mark. I'm in. Folks, I'm Dr. Mike. This is my biological son, and RP expert Fizzic Coach, IFBB Pro, Jared Fathers, and boys he look in large. But I'm the only, only, the only, the non-pro here today, because Mr. Mark Lowbliner here is an IFBB professional bodybuilder in the 2012 division, and he's the man, and I actually watched him get his pro card, and watch him do a lot of things. Actually, over the years, but don't tell him, he's here to do a leg workout. I'm going to be instructing in the back, and I'm not tough enough to jump in with these guys. But Mr. Jared Fathers will take the team full-rom seed. And see if Mr. Mark Lowbliner can keep up. We're only going to do one machine today, and that is the Matt Winning belt squat. We're going to do some stiff leg ed ed lifts with it, and then we're going to do some out, myorep, match squats. What does that mean? We'll find out shortly, won't we? I asked you a f***ing question, Jared. Why are you, are you f***ing father son, dude? Oh, that one, I understand. It's just waiting till I get into my U.S. when states got damaged, or you won't be able to have a home here son. All right. We're just having a family squabble. You can do squats, and at which we will shortly, but Mr. Jared Fathers here is going to replace he's going to turn the belt squat into a stiff-legged deadlift machine. All you do is unclip the carabiner, and then you clip that right in there. Just like me. Don't turn it or other, you go. That's it. Boom. And now we have a setup to do stuff like a deadlift, and ask the gentleman more, I'm going to talk. You guys through some techniques stuff. We'll do a few sets here. Do you want to give that a show below here? Because I don't really want my caps next to his. I'll send over there, and you'll look at it. If not, Mike Matterazer has a child. I want your back to be a f***ing like this. I'm going to be in your lower back exactly. All the way down, and when you feel yourself flexing, don't do it. Just do it. Just chest up. Chest up. As you stay upright, you're going to feel your hands get really f***ed. That's how you know. Chest knees back. There it is. One more. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Good. The rules of a stiff leg are the same. Fundamentally, whether you're using dumbbells, barbells, or machines, you want the bar close to you. You want your... Lordotic spine. This is not a athletic position. It is a lifting position. The only reason that we turn our spine, Lordotic, arched is because we're pre-tilting anteriorly. The bad way are pelvis wide. Because posterior tilt, it shortens the hamstrings. And anterior tilt, lengthens them. We want them pre-length them. So they are the limiting factor. So that as you go down, they pull apart. And that insane tension at the stretch is what provides hypertrophy. In order to keep this lower back arch, you want your tummy out and you want your chest up the whole time. So it's actually a good idea to look forward. And you're thinking of taking your butt hole and showing it to the ceiling like this. You're sitting back and down at the same time. Big chest. You're going to get nice and low. Your knees are going to want to come forward. Don't let them push them back gently. Not like this. That would be a bad idea. Just here. And as you go down, you're going to feel an insane painful tension. Your hamstrings. That's how you know you're doing it right. Yes. One more. Chest. These back. Yes. There you go. Oh fuck yeah. There's definitely a learning curve. To get into that phone. For sure. For sure. Slow. Big chest. Big chest. Big chest. Yep. Up. Beautiful. I don't want to hurt her. Slow. These are the chest on the way up here when you go. Deeper. Big chest. Yeah. Just up. And. Yeah. Oh. Did they grow? They're huge. Oh good. Think I. That's a big. Really. I should really just retire at this point. Some people will shake a lot when they're getting close to a. That repetition being very, very proximal to failure. And there are a couple of hypothesis of the wide happens. But one of the reasons they think the shake happens. Is when you are trying to gain a leverage advantage. Some destabilization can basically shake you into a better position. For example, if you're deadlifting in your right at your knees, if you just stable a crank on it, it might just stop. If your body is shaking, it might get it just over your knees. And then you can crank out the rest. If you ever notice someone especially untrained doing Brazilian Jutsu wrestling for the first time, someone fighting for their life like an animal or a human, they'll do this. At the very tip of whether getting choked out or whatever. And that's to destabilize the opponent and wiggle out or wiggle through. So when you're pushing a muscle hard enough, the body goes into fight or flight mode and goes, okay, start wiggling. So we can wiggle the fuck out of a situation. That's really about the best idea that anyone's has. Feel that. And up, good. But back and chest up at the same time. Slow. Chest. Chest. Chest. And up. Ooh. And that's that. This goes away. And now convert into about squat. While the guys are resting, let me guys give a master class, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Master class. Sit on the belt squat. You guys will notice we have a lot of plates for a lot of mats here. My wife is four foot 11. I am five foot six on a good day. And we want the highest forces to be closer to the bottom of the lift. If we stood on this thing, we would neither get full range of motion without these extra plates. Also, the weight would be leveraged to lowest at the bottom and the highest at the top, which is backwards. You want a deep stretch at the bottom. You're going to stand wherever's comfy, basically over the device. You're going to want to make sure you're not falling forward or backward too much. And then, here's the big deal. Your number one priority is to keep the heatals and toes on the ground at all times. Your number two priority is to allow your knee to travel as far over your toes as possible on the way. That gives you maximum quad stretching utilization. Priority number, last priority three is to make sure you sink all the way down to the bottom and sit there for about a second and then come up. And the fourth rule is go down slow. These things can you really lean into them? Yes, I wouldn't. Just use them for stability. If you can't get out of the bottom of one rep, you can pull yourself up and save your life. I wouldn't pull all the time to first floor. You're not here to train arms or lats. You're here to train your legs just for stability. So here's what you're going to do. And then get a good stance. It doesn't match much matter if it's wider near your arm. You can't take two near your stance because you're clipped your dick right off your body. But if you're female, I guess you're going to do them. JK, these things are going to rub and it's going to be annoying. So a little bit wider of a stance, toes pointed out. Watch what I do. I sink in. Oh, sorry. Last thing. My back is going to round. Typically in a squat, that's bad because there are forces going through your spine in barbell squat. In this, there are no forces that just don't go through the whole hip. So the back is entirely out of the equation. You can 1,100% round your back. You don't have to have chest up all the other cues. It's just the lower half of your body. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go down really slow. This is the actual pace we want in real training. Notice how deep I am. Heels down, toes down, Ultra deep, sit for one second. Come up. Slow. Letting the knees slide real far forward. Pause. Up. Slow. Controlled. Knees forward. Pause. And up. A nearly ideal thing to do on here is my erect. If you do my reps in a squat with a squat bar, having the whole bar in your back tires you are so much, you're just going to gas right out. You're going to get 12 and you're going to get a 3 and you're going to need zero. With this thing, because it's just the belt, you can always come up and rest here for a few seconds and then re-ragen go back down. You're going to watch as we do these sets. The guys will do a few reps. Rest for a bit. Do a few reps. Rest for a bit. Brutality. Three more. Oh yeah. One more. Slow. Slow. Big moves. One, two, three. Rest a bit. Two left. Oh shit. Up. Two times failure. Two times failure. Two times failure. Two times failure. Two times failure. Two times failure. Good stuff. You're going to be doing it. You're going to be doing it. You're going to be doing it. Yeah. You're going to be doing it. Absolutely. That's how much we use. That was nice. I'm going like seven to ten range for most of my heavy compound. Yeah. That fuck range. Yeah. It's a back. Slowly. Slowly. Wait. Heels up. Good. Again. Down. Go. Slow. Control. Up. Two more. Go. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Up. One more. Again. Slow. Slow. Wait. Stay tense. Up. Down. Down. Down. Down. That was fun. Another shake. That was my. My tank shaking. This is motherfucker. Scott, can you get the container? Your hamstrings of veins running across. The fuck is up with that. Might be good light. Yes. There's only good light there. It is good light. It is good light. Jared. Which you up to, baby? Don't you try to. Hey. Why don't you come control it over here while doing this. Bell spots. Just go to the hospital. Rest. Breathe. One. Up. Up. Up. Rest. Breathe. Nice. One. Up. Up. Rest. Breathe. Nice. Long time. One last. One left. Power. Go. Go. Rack. Beautiful. Holy shit. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let's see if we can get a total of about 15 reps here. All of that up together. I think you got it. Here's the thing really quick. Your technique from here to here is excellent. Your technique from here to here is very good. What I want you to focus on is when you get to here it's going to suck dick. Go slow. And then pause. Okay. If you go from here to here quick, you're missing out on the best part of the movement. Okay. I'm going to troll it. It's going to make it every tip I give you is the opposite of strength training. It's going to make it harder and harder. Would you like harder, don't you? I love harder. Heels. Yes. Up. One. Again. Slow. Heels. Up. Last one. Come it up. Take your time. I want you to sit back on your heels deep and sit there for two whole fucking seconds. Begin. Slow. Sit. Up. Back. My man. Quickly get yourself out. Up. Up. Up. One more. You got this. Slow and controlled. Slow and controlled. Slow and controlled. Up. Again. Go. We're here to fucking push it. Go, go, go, go, go. There's no rest time. Slow. Slow. Wait. Up. Down. Slow. Up. Down. Slow. Go right now, right now. You don't need your legs for anything. If you fall, you fall. Up. Up. Last one. Go down. Slow. Down. Slow. Push up. Beautiful. We're going to sit down. Just right here. This looks like nice but. I need insulin. It's in birthday game. All right, rich. Up. Up. Back. No, yes. Good. Good. Yep. Two more in your dump. Go. Go. Let's try again, Jared. You got this, mother fucker. Hell yeah, one more. One more. Make it slow. Low. Make it count. Two whole seconds at the bottom. One, two. Up. Yes. Good. Up. Yes. Good. Up. Up. I felt bad. Up. Oh, my nipples aren't. Oh, yeah. That's hard. That's. I never had that reaction from like day. Yes. We. Oh, fuck. My dick's already says about as good as you can. It's already. It's just trying to get hard all over. His nipples. You can see my dick. Nothing. You look fucking good, man. I think you so much. Mark. When's the first time you realize that men can just be beautiful. You just want to look at him. I wasn't very. I know. So, so from an actual serious standpoint, the human body is more active. You're saying it gray. The first time. The first time I saw Flex magazine, I was 15 years old with Doryniates on the cover. And I saw the hamstring greenness. Yeah, some weird shit. And for me, that was when I'm like the human body is capable of amazing things. That's when I decided that this weightlifting thing is something I'm really interested in. Yeah. No, that's a good answer. Jared, how's that work out for you? Jared has asthma. So proving that he is my Jewish biological scientist. That's just a good approach. Three Jews. He's more or less three Jews walking to a gym. What happens? That's about never happened before. My back. Anyway, it's been a huge pleasure having. Thanks for putting that out. With my bullshit and. Yes. Absolutely. Whatever Jared is, guys, make some sense out of this video. See you guys next time. Thank you.
