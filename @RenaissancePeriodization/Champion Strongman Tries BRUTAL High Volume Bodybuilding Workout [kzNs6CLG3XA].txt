Folks, this is Mitchell Hooper. He has won the World Strongest Man Competition. I'm Dr. Mike and I have won the second best-looking person in my bathroom between the hours of 3 and 5 pm on Tuesday at one time competition. And I was proud of every single one of those victories. How do I sack up in my bodybuilding, high-perrophy, back-and-shoulder training to World Strongest Man Champion? We're gonna find out in a second. Oh, when he's Canadian by the way. Good. Yeah. Finish. Stricted to come on. Rrrr. Yes. 15. Wow, that's so much heavier than it looks. All right. So 15 reps here. Super maximum stretch at the top. And then just gently touch your chest at the bottom by arching your back. Now, super maximum stretch at the top. Can we contextualize this? Because if I super maximum stretch, I tend to have my pecs into my throat. And it chokes me out of the same bro. Same. Just vibe it. That's one of those things that the folks on the TV will be like, what? When you get jacked enough, you say, remember distinctly two years ago, I finally got jacked enough to choke myself on bull downs. And I was like, oh, the dumb. Try your best. We'll see how it is. Also, let the blood flow when you're down here so that you don't pass out. Are you gonna pass out? No, no, no, no. It's just uncomfortable. You bitching about uncomfortable. But why am I getting you know about sacrifice here? If I'm honest, it just turns me on a bit. I don't want to do that on your channel. Oh. How does the covering feel back to 100%. I don't feel anything in my scar. No pain. It's a little tight and still inflamed. It'll be inflamed up to a year after surgery. What? I still haven't done any heavy flexion rolling. Sure. But I'm cleared for it now, officially. I start GJJ next week. Oh, cool. So yeah. So, yeah, pretty goddamn good. Cool. And in terms of aesthetics for scar bodybuilding, if you sure looks all right. There's going to be two vertical scars that stick out all the time in every pose. Okay. I don't give a shit. I think scar is look cool. Also. But the main scar is completely hidden in my pose and trunks. Awesome. That's great. That's like half the eye of UV. I'm kidding. That was a UV. There's like a three things you have to consider during a given set. One thing is how hard am I trying? That's indistensive. Yeah. Because you can be like, oh, man, I'm going to really feel my last. But you're using like 30 pounds for like, that's a 10 or 50 R I R. Wow, I trained. They want to do that. And the other one is technique, like externally validated technique, like your elbows moving the right way, you're not cheating, et cetera. And the last one is like, are you connected to your muscles that you're supposed to be hitting? And like, are your lats really doing something or something else taking over? Which you do have some small say in budget. And so all three of those need to be checkmarked with a green check. And it's as little of expense of each other as possible. So the way I like to do it is this, I like to for people who are training for hypertrophy for other sports like strong man. It's intensities number one, go hard. Make sure you have good technique, don't sacrifice. And then way lastly, fuck it if at all, worry about where your lats are doing. You're lats are fine. Yeah, strong man. They're going to get some benefit. For pure bodybuilding, pure physique, you actually start with technique. Like technique, gun to my head, I'll never can fail the technique. Then you miss, if it's good technique, then every single rep I have to have intensity on. But that's roughly tied to feel. So if I have good technique, put it more around. And I can't feel my lats anymore. The next rep I pull from my lats. I'm only here to train my lats. If I'm not feeling, I'm not sure sure that it's going well. However, the intensity still there because if you really feel your lats, which are not inclining, you're not pushing in a lot of force, then you're just kind of showing. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense, of course. This guy is a great, great question. It's a real, a real thing. Music Music Oh, that's it. Rack, I missed the pump so much. In training in the first place, that's what I fell in love with the most. Yeah, it's good. Well, you can always make a return to the real sport. The body building, the real sport becoming incredibly incapable and doing a beauty pattern. Hey, you know what I'm saying? Beauty is about pain or whatever. For what it is, I think body buildings are awesome. For what I'm saying, call it a sport. Agreed. You know, agreed. It's a great performance out. Agreed. I have actually a technical, a technical reason why I wouldn't call it a sport. Okay. My, one of my favorite definitions of what a sport is is that it is a competitive interaction. The outcome of which is based at least in part on your physiological performance limit. Cool. So people will say chess is a sport. Like are the pieces really heavy? Will you fall over from time? Yeah. Not a sport. Golf is a debate. It could be a game. Now, okay. Because it doesn't really push you to your limit and hardly any way. Not. Is body building a sport? Intraining, yes. In competition, absolutely not. Yeah. No, in a way. Is it a pageant? Yes. I'll tell you what body building really is. And this is a big compliment to body building art. Yeah. It's a real art. Absolutely. Now, you give me three world-strogous man contenders and a big puddle of jealous. No, I'm sorry. Scott's dying from laughter over there. He's got you sick. Fuck. You got four. Let's go. System. System. Come on. Why was that, Jim? I thought it was going to get harder for you. Yeah. Yeah. I was waiting for it to get harder to share you on. You're good. I can get hard, Mitch. Oh, exercise. Yeah. Two things. One fake failure. Two. Um. My failure for many exercises. Looks like that. So two reps away from there. I would have had to start cheating to get any reps. What? Yeah. But it looks fine up into that. I don't feel fine. Yeah. Looks fine. Yeah. I know it looks like I don't train close to failure. But I just want you guys to know, like, I'm really tough. Like, I'm a tough guy. Yeah. You want me to show you tough? How show you tough? Hey! Hey! Last one. Good one. Boom. Flow. Big stretch. Yes. So you guys say, come on. Two more. Good. And let's go. Strip. Come on. Roo. Whoa. Hello. Just several years ago, I was wandering homeless and alone in the Los Angeles suburbs. And I was picked up by the police and they told me that I can't come back to that neighborhood. Unless I come in with the best grip assistance advice ever, the VersuGrip. I came back in and they welcomed me in like family. And now I'm a real human being with with the goals and ambitions. And one of my ambitions is to make sure that when I'm training back or shoulders or hamstrings with stiff leg and that lifts. And then I can do that because the VersuGrip is wrapped around the bar and giving everything you need to take my back shoulders and hamstrings to bounce. I'm going to say pound town, better than me. Funkey town. Sure. VersuGrip is a great and even a world-striker man, Mitchell Hooper, is here to have me read this ad read, but I don't know who he's sponsored by and who not cited and want to include. You could tell me the pound town, if you want. We'll be back. I thought it was going to be a however for you. I can get hard, Mitch. Next exercise, which we can do just one warm-up set for, is going to be the lat prayer, aka the straight arm lat pulled out. I've been fuzzing with this attachment on it recently. It brings your lats in close at the top, which extra stretch is done, which is awesome. The other thing is, it has these stoppers, which with VersuGrip's or straps, you might not need him. We have chalk too. Really make sure that you're not slipping. I see guys do the rope, but not on the back stoppers. Like a middle of the rope. Yeah, like, for sure, no, you're not trying to. Yeah. There you go. Come on. Yep. Let's get into it. Let's get it. We're trying to find where the pain is and go in more. That's right. You heard exactly like I said it. Couple more. Couple more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Oh. There it is. Finish. Finish. Finish. Oh, and control. There you go. Beautiful. Wait a fix. I'm sorry. How many was that? 18. So good news, bad news. You have three sets of 18. With many breaks. Yes. I don't get to let him go. No. No. Maya Ratnach. So however many reps you did in the first set, all the subsequent sets of which we have three today are some total of the same number of reps. That's what you take as many breaks as you want. Five to ten seconds between reps to go. You might get like ten and then four and then another four. That's going to hurt. It's going to hurt. Yeah. The thing about training for growth intensity fucking matters going close to failure matters. Once you get to within a certain amount close to failure, we're after the set you feel kind of pumped and like ten Chin was really good. Yeah. The thing that matters the most after us, how much volume you do. A clean and simple. And then so volume can measure in total sets or total reps. But it really can be measured also in number of approaches to failure. Yeah. And so with Maya Ratnach, you do 18 times four number of reps with like eight approaches to failure. Holy fucking shit. That's a lot of volume. Yeah. That's a lot of stuff. And there is no way around it either. You got to put in that fucking work. And again, let's go. 12. 12. 12. 13. Go ahead, Mike. You got three. Show rest. Let's go. You got a bite. See, last one perfect. Good man. Stretch. Hold it. Your back's going to be double the size after this shit. Yes. One more Mitch. Let's go. Yeah. One more Mitch. Let's go. Oh. Yeah. One more. My man. Yeah. Finish. Strong slow. Big stretch. Rest. Oh. Whoa. Bro. That was a slow. My man. Somebody got three left. Three left. You're the fucking man. Let's do it. Man's physique. World champ. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Slow. That's it. Oh. Man. Oh. Yeah. That's it. Oh. Man. Oh. Yeah. Good stop. That's it. That was a cue there. It really seemed to work for you. Athletic and strong. Yeah. That was a good stop. Yeah. I'm just concentrating on my concentration. Bodybuilding control bullshed on the eccentric. Yeah. Works every time. You can take that cue and put it in your pocket for all of your head hurts. We training. Yeah. So, a lot of people get into this phase in this mode. Where there's like a real mind muscle connection on that powerfully centric. When you're really slowing it to try to like get stuff going. For people overdue that and like so for example, on leg curls. I'll curl fast in the way up because I'm just trying to like match them. And then I'll slow a centric on the way down. Half the comments like, oh, shouldn't you be like controlling that movement? Like on the way down. Yes. On the way up. Be athletic. As long as the mechanics are good, which they are like push up power and don't like do this pretend. I'm not saying you're doing it by the way. Yeah. People do it all the time. Yeah. The pretend kind of like fucking really feel it on the way down. Like stop. Yeah. Move it on the way down on the way up is when you're really going to feel sure. Sure. Which makes sense because I suppose that's a closer match between e-cens or concentric as well. If you try to explode. 100% versus control. 100%. All right. So last back exercise coming up. Probably you want your straps for this one. Okay. Let me check my RPA picture view. RPA picture view. I got my own voice stuck in my own head. Chesaporter row. Chesaporter rows for these chest supported hose. We got three of my let's go. Two. One more good one. Keep it solid. The extra. Ugh. Ugh. Whoa that hits. 12 weight of strength. 12 weight of strength. 13, two more good ones. Okay. Keep it chest down. Yes. 15. Rack. Fortress. Wow that's so much heavier than it looks. Yeah. Yeah. I got a lot of shit for doing two plates on this and I'm just like, I don't know. That's all I have. Yes. Because it commercial james are four plates on that first shot. Still not. Well, first shot. That Atlantis does not go around. 16. Okay. Four per cent. One. Stretch. Do it halfway there. And again. Last one. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. We're ain't a control two more. Slow. Slow. Slow. Deep stretch. Pulled it. Rack. Oh. That's so humbling though. Jesus. Yeah. Good stuff man. Scott. If you ever work. Up to this. I'm here. You are the world's strongest man. We're done on here. We're going to go do lying straight arm front raises for five sets of a shit load of reps. My right match. I'll talk about that in a sec. But the only way really I got my shoulder to grow was to do a little volume. I can hate it. I hate training shoulders. I ain't going to do it anywhere. I'm just having a shot today. So he's. I want to see what you can do on this because. Dems are some big showyledes. You know, no. What's your best standing over at press? Uh, Barbeau. Barbeau. Not split jerk. I've done. No pushing. Oh, straight. Straight. Ah. Four ten four fifteen. No. Not much. Just more than everyone has spot. But that's Barbeau. Like log is logs about four thirty. Yeah. Yeah. Or should be able to do more than me on this. What I'm trying to say. Maybe because I only over had press four or five. And my dreams. Okay. Let's go. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Two. Yes. Finish. Oh, there's another control. Bragg. Oh, Jesus. Great. That was like what? 25 or 60? 23. 23. So for next time, instead, what did you do? 100 and a 5. Why don't you do like 120? And then just that's a 15 or something. Yeah. Another four sets of 15 at 120 or so. And then. 17. Straight through. 15. 15. Oh. That was awesome. I can't believe that your shoulder endurance compared to mine. I couldn't imagine doing what I did on the first set for. For even one more set. Yeah. It's just that I have really big. I don't know. I've been doing this for like weeks where I've been doing. I'm doing like three to five. My up match sets for shoulders. Yeah. Every. Basically four times a week. Like I'm doing like 25 set equivalence of shoulders per week. Yeah. And like they, they will get adaptations. Yeah. It's also the only thing that's really moved the need to learn my dull hyper-tripe. And now like legitimately like right now, I have the biggest delts I have ever had by a long shot. Right. Like just and I don't. I've been saying this recently in the internet. I don't want the fact that I have the biggest shoulders that I've ever had to be because of just grinding. King volume. You look at the literature. Yeah. But okay. Yes. I just don't know where. Which is like it's getting a game. Right. On the one hand it kind of sucks. There's nothing like I want the micmen's should to be true. Yeah. I want me in one emotional set on the axe blocks to be the difference in the league. I would love that. Yeah. But the reality is more grim. But also the positive is it's really straightforward. You don't like like how do I grow my muscles? Like are you having trouble recovering? No. Do more volume. Yeah. Really like. Yeah. How do I get better at math? Like do your homework more like fuck me. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't this a good time to read it for you? Of course. All right folks. Trying to read books to figure it out. That's a it's a rookie mistake. We didn't learn our shit and books. Man's work. That you know I've both known our respective fields. For not being that sharp. We got that work. We got that flavor. Get that shit. We're out here doing it. You feel me in way is zero prisoners taken. And no regrets. And any other means you would like to add into this conversation. Just a quick shout out there on the. Promise. And you guys forget about her on bay. How dare you. Mitchell Hooper, a real strongest man. He's got an excellent YouTube channel. That's not only informative, but also entertaining. And if it's late at night, you put it on mute. You can watch him talk. Perfect. Catch him there. Big back workout for here. Hopefully you guys enjoyed it. Look for more content from both of us in the future. I'll see you next time. Thanks, guys. Bye.
