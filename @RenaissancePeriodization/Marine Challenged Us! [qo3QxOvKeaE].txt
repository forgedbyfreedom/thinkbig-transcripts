Go! Go, Mother! Up! Up! You will continue to stand up. Check, stop! Slow, this leg leads. Go! You Tube! I'm Dr. Mike. This is Will. This is Zach. Will hit us up and he was like, hey, I've seen a bunch of your workouts. He didn't say I'm a big fan of anything. You just said, you guys don't know how to train hard. And I will physically destroy all of your workouts, about batting. And then he said a lot of expert things, and I'm going to do it in sensitive stuff. After I read the email and cried for a while, I decided why not invite Will over, have an RP style high rep quad workout, to see if it's really true that we can't train people hard. But you brought a secret weapon, 18 year old, barely legal, YouTube don't demonetize me. Zach over here is a real strong competitive power lifter. Can he compete with a high rep quad workout? We'll see, place your bets on the comments below. We're going to do hackswats. Then we're going to do a question about question about question mark. If the guys are still alive, maybe some pendulum squats, let's get it. Done, gentlemen, any comments on how you think this will go. Today we kill a Russian don't believe. Russian, not the event that I'll come through anymore. Zach, what do you think? I'm ready. Ready to go? Can you or a Polish ancestry? Yes. Mars, Christianowski, better show up. Back in the year 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell, they asked one East German individual, what is your most, what is the thing you want from the West that you're most excited to get? And he said, soft-survice cream. Soft-survice cream. The next thing he said was, I want to be able to do deep high repetition hackswats. Isn't freedom fucking awesome. We're going to start with hackswats. We're going to do three to five sets here, 10 to 20 reps, two paws, my reps style. You guys already know what that is. These folks are used to more west side style training. Let's see how that all adds up. Deeper still. I think I will not marry. Deeper still. Is this a sin? Yes, that was better, but pause at the bottom. I'm going to full convincing pause. Good, deeper pause lower. Good, yes. Control on the way down all the way until you hit the bottom. That's it. Now we know for both of you guys, until you hit the bottom, don't come up. I want one second at the bottom. We'll have to ask the bottom out every time. We're going to bottom out on big mic. What got you into strength? Weakness. Like that? We'll get this off-clancer. I was wrestling in high school and I decided to do one of you weak anymore. It's just a training in the weight room, and then I fell in love with the weight room. And then I ended up coming back to grappling nine years ago, so now I do two gypsum. Good control again. Slow.

I don't think all. Got that. Got a leg pump. Nobody's fucking business. Oh, we're just starting to have fun. All right. Folks, the hack squatting has gone off to an excellent start. And now we do an excellent finish with the pendulum squat or whatever the fuck this is called pendulum. Whatever. We call it the heaven right maker. That's someone from down river says that you can treat it skeptically because those people are all in down river folk. They're different. If you're using this machine guys, what you want to do is make sure in most cases you put your feet nice and low on the platform. High in the platform, you'll be able to lift more weight, but it'll be less specific to the quads. Low on the platform means you get lots of knee flexion and then lots of muscle growth. Always a slow and controlled decent. We're always going to pause. I actually have never done this machine before. Oh, look at this guy here. Never yield the guys. But it's just pretty radically. I think it's hot works. It's going to be really hard to make. There's go down slow. That's not as hard. All the way full pause. Yes. And all the way up. Good. And a couple more. Just to get there. I mean, he's been talking to me. Sets are reps. Both. You know, I'm not quite sure yet on the sets, but reps are going to be around the fish. So you're going to be around the 15 reprangers. Now, if you wanted to keep something like this, audio lower back, how would you do that? This machine really probably doesn't pretty well, and you put your feet as low as possible. Okay. Get in the tips from the master. Good master. Rack of you. Amazing. All day. The letter pops with you. Show. Up. Again. Show them. Hands up. Slow. Up. Drive. Up. Up. Up. Rest. Go anywhere. Hands up one more. Drive. Control. Go. Slow. Up. Up. One last one. Go right now. Slow. Control. Deep. Up. Stores. Go, go, go. Rack. Oh, that was great. That was so good. I heard just looking at it. That dude. Get the bad dude. Just like his daddy. Get everything. Oh, I'm not his daddy. You know what I mean? I'm not his daddy. Up. Rope. Again. So, I started again. I didn't say rest. That was dumb. Up. Rope. Rest for real now. Rest. I want the next wrap to be slowing the way down. We're not dropping onto a deal. Do it your day job. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's not a slithing. Slow. Yes.

And one final one for the books. Right now. That was so cool. That was so beautiful. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Now I want to touch me. I've been waiting to touch you this whole time. Do that was awesome. I didn't think you'd get that many reps based on how your warm-up work. Fucking problems. I've been serious problems. Oh. You're warm-up looks shaky. This one was way better. I was really impressed. All right. Zack. High quality reps just like last time. You don't have to do anything differently. It was perfect. Slow and controlled. Super deep. Let's get a couple reps in there, man. Good. Hey. The more of these you do, the taller you go. Oh. Let's go. Up. No mercy. No bouncing. Slow. Up. I like him slower. I'm right. You got him. Slow. Get out down. Up. Drive. Back. Again. Hands up.

Don't touch your fucking legs, Zach. You're the fucking man. Do the shirt right. Do it right. Yes. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. One more. Bring down the wood. You're done. That's it. So I got a question for you. I can check this out. What does it that you have against quadriceps muscles? I hate them. Why don't you get them to that fucking bar? I hate them. You have a lot of time. I'm not going to get them. I'm going to get them. Finish it. Up. Up. Again. Right away. No rest. Slow. Up. Up. Again. Go. Slow. Up. Up. Up. Again. Go. Go. Slow. Now. Up. Up. Up. Rest. Rest.

That was really good. That's training. You showed up today. That's training. That's training. All right. YouTube. A couple things that I want to know. Zack is the fucking man. Crush this workout. He's not even breathing heavy. Huge awesome future head. Honor to have you here sir. Amazing work. Well, I've trained three people that were more pathetic than you, but you're real close. Amazing work today. Amazing. Way to put yourself off course. And for the rest of you, if you ever get to be, what would you do to what did you do in the US Marines back when you were in the US? This is a great color for Rick Hives and maybe his engineer. Some people are born tougher. Some people are made tougher. So think about talking to your recruiting officer. Some people are free. Some people are free. Some people are just fake. They're all shit. Don't blinks. Overweight Jewish people. They're also balding. I'll see you guys next to stay brutal. Thank you.
