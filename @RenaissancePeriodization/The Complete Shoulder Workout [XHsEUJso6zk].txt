One more, one more, one more. Lift, one more. One more. Go! Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, down slow. Aye! I'm gonna do it. Yo, YouTube, what up? Got a few people to introduce you to me. I'm Dr. Mike. Hello. Hey, held on. Jared Feather, IFBB Pro, Master's degree in Exercise and Sport Science. Elite Coach of Elite Pro, that's all true. And the most true part, my literal biological son. Look at him. My boy. See, he's in and he had a daughter recently. Oh, my, this is Jenna Geary. She is not due to the channel. You guys know her. Tell her what up in the comments. She trains at one speed. Hard. I don't know if hard is a speed. Hard as 10 today. Hard as your body. You know what I'm saying girl? Aye. I'm going that. I'm 100. Shout-off, Dr. Mike. Let's get to the video. First exercise is the face bolt. Can be done in a variety of ways with a variety of grips. We have some interesting dildo handles today. They're new here, Dragonslayer. And we kind of think like, hey, why not? Let's try. The purpose of the face pull is to train any part of the delts, which lines up best with a direction of pull. In the case with baseball, it really just depends on where you put the attachment itself and how it slides. So if you put it lower, then you pull more up. It's more side belt. If you put it higher and you pull down, it's more rear belt. But if you put it too high, you get a lot of backwards as well. So we like to say right at about face level is a good place to start and work from there. Remember to get a big stretch at the bottom. And a nice peak contraction at the top to hold for a second and squeeze and connect with those rear belts if you can. And then we go from there sets of, oh yeah, you know, 15 to 25 reps really is the kicker here. Whether the reason is because these reps don't take a long time each, it's not a lot of distance to move. And it ends up being that we can generate more tension over more time. Get a bigger burn if we can actually do a few more reps. Watch this technique. Jen is fucking ace when it comes to the shit. I'm sure my head will pop up later until you more tips. Yes, three more. Three more. Yeah, this time no bullshit. Let's go. One slow. Oh shit. Okay, don't swing. We're adult. Two slow. One jump. We're adult. We're adult. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. Go ahead and wrap. Uh. You know, I can't open her belts already. You fucking wrecked your belts like really stupid. Holy shit. That's a nice one. Oh, my god. Oh, is there already a way to get instant cheated? A couple more reps for sure. No, no. You're adults. Oh, how are you? Yeah. One jump. Munchin. Dells. Yeah. Two more. No swinging. One. Last one coming up. Helples back. Yes, slow. One. One. Hey. Yeah. Oh, sweet. That was so good. You know, it's got their own zip code at this point. Oh. Oh, I want a drink, but I can't. I wish I had straw. Why can't you drink? Because I can't hold my cut. Are we getting this? Gen is so fucking jack and lean that you will see the direction of her fiber contraction. In this exercise, making the coaching easier shit, you'll also see that at the tail end of the range of motion as the pull on the Delta cursor. The rear belts are very elongated and they are significantly short and happy end. Does this mean it's all rear belt. No. The side belts also go through the same process. And the extra size of the backrest is very easy to. And the more we execute it, the more we execute it. Exercise in this case for the growth face pull includes a rear belt as well as side belts. Because side belts are very resistant to hypertrophy, your rear belts are already getting a craplot of work from back training every single back exercise. Trains your rear belt are known. And that means the rear bolts are already kind of being trained really well. Kind of like the front delts are from chest training. We'll take as much extra side-to-side don't work as we can. The key here is quality and watch this. One of the cues you're gonna use is to tell Jen to have a slow, e-centre control. It's easy to pull it up to here. Slowly lowering and feeling those fibers, micro-terr. Oh, that is, as people say, the bees knees. The Jenner-brash, the understood what that means. Do bees in fucking have me, the shirt, shit on our kneecaps. Another little shit's been, but the two preview to look at, under-microscope is oo. They got all that air in the bite. Fuck that, fuck you in sack. One more, go check me, if it stops and stops, whatever. Up, up, up, up, up, up. And I'm gonna take a picture of it. Oh, very good. Oh, I want to stop left. I'm gonna sore hands. Good. You got this. Oh, these are so good. Excellent. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Excellent. Oh, good. Good. Good. Three more, you're done. Good technique though. Almost back. One. One. Hold it back there for a second. Two. Two. Last one. Yes. Oh, God, fuck my hands. Don't fuck my hands. Fuck something else. Sorry. I was gonna appropriate. We'll let her wait for her. We'll wait for her. All right. You, yeah. That's okay. Sorry. All right. So here's the deal. A variation on the theme of side belt training with lateral scumballaderos. It is totally great to do dumbbell ladderos to just below parallel. Amazing. It is totally great to do them to just above parallel. Amazing. It is totally cool to do them and stop at whatever point you want for a split second. Another way to do them is this. We realize that between here and here, gravity doesn't affect us much because the joint angle is all wrong. We're having only points down. From here to here, not a whole lot happens either. So what we're gonna try today is Jenna's gonna start at roughly 45 degree angle. Go up to above 45, come back down under control. Up and pause, down under control. Every time it's 45 degrees, 45 degrees. This means constant tension on the muscle, which isn't some magical thing. It just means lack of gas, but it'll accumulate. And interesting things will happen. As soon as you're done with a set like that, you switch to the dumbbells pointed this way and you pull up with your elbows to do dumbbell upright rows. These will also be with a pause. Sound good? Yes. Don't worry about how high the reps are. Just every rep quality. Oh, these are so good. Good. I'm swinging. Up. Get your thumbs in there. Get your thumbs under. You'll couple more. Okay. Good. Two more. Wait my god. Oh, my god. That's it. Okay, up right rows. Close. High and pause. Slow. Okay. One more. Just don't. Oh, you got a couple more. You got this. You got this. That's it. Two more. Nothing. Right away. Slow. I need some bottom beat. That's it. Pause. Slow. And good enough. That's a good. Very good. Those suck. It tends just toast. Oh, God. Why don't you feel like a suck? You great. This is the, for you came here to hurt. They're going to accomplish. See what I'm wearing. Oh, we're doing the five. Can you tell the camera why we're doing the five? Yeah. Because I suck. That's like a lot of times. Because I'm going to find a five because she is doing an attempt to technique. She's obviously very pump-up already from the exercise before this. And this whole, like he said earlier, it's like constant tension on a muscle. True constant tension on a muscle. You're just constantly sequestered more and more and more in metabolites. The entire set. So no, she does not suck. She says very fucking big delts between you actually can sequester even more metabolites. So we're going down so she can get more reps, kind of meet the needs of the intensity technique that we're doing. You don't suck. I do suck. I do suck. I do suck. I do suck. I do suck. That are doing 25, 50s, 60s. Fucking loud. Or is it like this? With 80s? Get out of here with that shit. Yes. Two more. Two more. Two more. Oh, you're so steady. Come on. Hell yeah. Yes. Two. One more. You're fucking down, Jen. Beautiful. And then I'm right, Rose. Pause. Close. Close. Yes. Bring it to you face. Beautiful. Yes. That's perfect. I'm swinging. Yes. Just delts. I'm just tired. Hold on. Down. Yes again. Keep going. Go. Go. Two more. Two more in your down. Delts. I'm swinging. Hold. One more. Go. Go. Hold. Go. Go. Go. Go. I'm by. Ha ha. I think it's drinkless. Oh, you've got a problem with Delts. There's nowhere to hide from the left. Yeah. You can put your legs down. You're on your arms. Your belts are just like, yeah. Oh, it hurts so bad right now. I'm just like, I'm so bad. No. The outcome tells us how to take it. Maybe I'll get some action. You're like, uh, oops, my man. Actually, like, if I wanted to. If I was. If I became violent and I wanted to strain you, go like this. I just do like, right. Take off. I just don't know. Go. Try. Oh, no. How. Jans delts are enormous. And with proper technique and a high level of relative efforts, how much you give to each set. She's using the five's. Your boy, you know, TLDR. I do from the side. I do have quite large delts. Just not from the front. And I have overhead pressed to 75 for eight standing. It is on YouTube. And I only need like the 20s or the 25s for the sector size. I can even get a ton out of the 50s. You're just trying to make me feel better. No, it's legitimately true. I don't have never tried to make you feel good in my life. Oh, yeah, sure. Good one. Good one. So, honestly, you need to use progressive overload. More reps, more weight over time. That place where you start or replace where you start with really good technique could be so low. You look around the gym. You're like, and I have the only here person here doing the fives. Remember, at your gym, if Jans showed up and fucking got a belt pump, she would shut everything down. All the guys who be looking at all the girls who are looking at that. Holy fuck, shit. This is a nice me pro. This is good as it gets. She's using the fives. Don't you fucking worry about what you're using. Think about your technique. Jared, what are you used for this exercise? 15 to 20. Jared delts have their own delts. And those delts, they're working on delts in their own. Think about that shit. Let's do it up a sec. Wonder what the food? Never heard of her. Let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Yes. Beautiful, too, bar. Put them up there and keep them up. Hold it. Go in for a door. Hold it. Hold it. Down. Again, again. Again, I know you do. Hold it. Down. Keep going. Keep going. Come on. Go. I always. Go. Go. One more. One more. Go. Go. One more. Go. Go. Yes. Another one. We're here for pain. A fucking day. Yes. Go. Go. Go. Go. One more. One more. Lift. Go. Go. Hold it. Hold. Hold. Hold. Down. Drop. Drop. I'm not damn doomed. I don't train. I'm not telling you that for years, Mike. The delts are almost destroyed. We could use a little bit more fraught deltwork just to cap the whole thing off. And when you're rear and side delts are really really toasted, if you're doing standing barbell overhead presses properly, they will also begin to be the limiting factor, especially the side delts. So this actually is a very good side delt exercise. If your side delts are pretty exhaust, you're going to notice that Jenna is doing the quintessential thing for good overhead press. This is not a good overhead press. That's just more upper chest and just front delt. A good overhead press pushes over the face. And as soon as you pass the face, real close to the face, you're going to push the bar backwards. And you're going to push your face forward. And you're going to reverse that movement on the way back down. That backward pushing, you'll notice the angle is that actually hits your side delt. It's a really awesome movement. I wouldn't do it first in an exercise training session because you're going to be fresh and lift the trillion pound. And your front delts and triceps are good anyway from chest and trice up training. But at the end of a session for shoulders, if you hit the rear, if you hit the sides, and Jen's done two exercises already for the sides and one for the rear. This begins to be a really good overall shoulder exercise. Technique is king, slowly centric, touch the clavic lever time. Keep the bar as close to your face every time, tight core, chest slightly up. Let's do things. Good, slow. Yes! Slow. Slow. Off to the back. Back. Do it one more. Take your time with this one, slow on the way down, pause at the bottom. Oh yeah. Up. Back. One. Yes! Slow and then wrap. Push it down as if you're going to do another. Hold. Rack. This should. You're like if a Wonder Woman action figure was built properly for the first time ever. It's fucking awesome. I'll take that shit. I'll take it. Now, I'm taking that shit right here. Take my money. There you go. I give the good with the bad. The bad news has started. Okay. Slow. Good. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. That's it, rat, rat, rat. That's it, Bethlehem. Yeah, your delts are really fucked, huh? Fuck. Yes. They are. Ah. Do we get the thumbnail already? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do we get the thumbnail already? Okay. Do I legs look good? Does my waist look small? Did you? Scott, are you doing your job? Oh, they want, okay. Do your job. I'm sure they have. Shrinking, inch and a half. Okay. I bet that hasn't shrunk. No, it hasn't happened to her big dick. Oh, I'm on my arm. According to the internet of the human toy. I'm going to lose it. If you talk, I like that. All right. Folks. Gen. You're training intensity is in another level. All together. How do you do it? Tell your fans what the secret is to get a genetic year. Level of intensity. For me, I push as hard as I push because I can't physically. Can't quit. So like, if I have anything in me, I'm going to give everything I got to push. The reps. Why not just quit? It's easy. Because I want to see what my body's capable of. And if I just keep pushing my limits, then I'm going to capitalize on every rep on everything. And then I really truly see what I can do. I can't do a better out trip than that. See you guys next time.
