Stop doing regular steady state cardio. Be Shred is a fucking super-hearies here to save us from the shit because we know steady state cardio is bad because... Just stop doing it. Just stop doing it. That's the reason enough for me Mr. Be Shred. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Anacense Predization on the creator of the RPI Perchryfy app and a professor of exercise at Sports Science, Lehman College in the Bronx, in New York City, in the state of New York, in the country of the United States, on the North American continent, in the Western Hemisphere, on the planet Earth, in the solar system, in a very, very important thing to do with you guys today. It's going to be an activity in which we cooperate together. It is to critique and examine and parse and explain the V-Shred workout diet, whatever advice V-Shred is giving out. Now, for the purpose of this video, I'm going to assume that there is one individual whose name is V-Shred. And that's what I'm going to call him. Mr. Be Shred. Sure, he has a real name. I don't care about it. Off to the races. Which body type are you? I have an answer to that. There is no such thing as body type and science has confirmed that about 10,000 times body types or myth. So I'm not a body type, but let's see what Mr. Be Shred thinks about that. You're not allowed to play these games? Yes. Yes. Also, yes. People are making all these different fitness programs. People like UV Shred. But they're not talking about the most important piece. Lying to people about results that they're going to get on your programs? Oh, sorry, I digress. Which is making sure that the program actually fits your body type and actually fits your goals. Tell me you didn't go to school without telling me you didn't go to school. That's here about body types. If you're trying to lose weight, the last thing you need is to follow my workout plan where I'm trying to bulk up. Okay. The workout plan doesn't have a ton to do with whether you lose your game weight. That's actually almost entirely dictated by your diet and an energy expenditure. If you're very physically active and you don't eat a lot, it doesn't matter how you train you're going to lose weight. And if you're training hard, you're going to keep all your muscle and lean down. If you eat lots of food and your physical activities more limited, you're going to be gaining weight and if you train the exact same weight, just like he does, then you will gain muscle and gain weight. So really the workout specific to your goals is already overstated. If you're trying to bulk up, the last thing you need to do is follow some weight loss plan. That's not going to work for you and your body types. So I don't think your body type changes when you pick a different goal. Maybe there's a contradiction in terms here somewhere. I'm sure if we get to how the f*** body type has anything to do with anything. But so far, I just talked about goals. Not body types. I get not doing a plan that's different for your goals, which also isn't true in this case. But how does body type lead in there at all? What we did to combat this. Well, f***er, who is weest? You in a f*** cell phone camera. Was we over here at V-shred created? Which is your name is V-shred. Your first name is V-shred. This V-shred. First name, last name. A free body type quiz. Oh, thank God. I thought I was going to have to pay my own harder money to take a body type quiz. Luckily it's free. That takes into account what shape you're in. What shape you're in has nothing to do with your body type? The body type is supposed to be something that is immutable about. It is a way that you are shaped that muscle and fatter added into that equation. It's attracted from it. But I don't know where he means by body type. And I guarantee you he doesn't either. What your exact goals are in your body measurements. Okay, that's not a body type quiz. That's a body type goals and measurements quiz. And it basically gives you three free tips based on your body type. E last, that f***. E more protein while eating less and lift some weights. You're welcome. I saved you the quiz. And then also has a little hidden surprise at the end of it. So. Oh, f***. Wait, wait, wait, wait. If there's a hidden surprise, you're not going to stop me from being able to click on an R-U. I'm going to click on it. And I'm going to do whatever it takes in that surprise. If it's that entering the top of the funnel for your bullshit, Ponsi Fitness Scheme Count Me in. If you're looking to get in shape, understand if you're an extomorb, a mesomorph or an into morph. Yep, those aren't real things. Those are all mythical.

What's up, ishred? I got a quick tip for anybody who is trying to get in shape. Not anyone who is trying to get in shape. Because according to the last thing you said, general tips don't work. You have to take the body type quiz. If I'm of the wrong body type or kind of goal, then no tip is going to be good for me. That's also good for you. Now you're saying there's one universal tip that's good for us all. Well, this is just confusing. Stop doing regular steady state cardio. I mean, guys, everyone knows regular steady state cardio is like starvation in Africa. The massacre in Myanmar right between a steady state cardio and the here devilishness that exerts on our poor, f***ing unsuspecting world. vshred is a f***ing super here. He's here to save us from the shit because we know steady state cardio is bad because just stopped doing it. Just stopped doing it. That's reason enough for me mr. vshred. Because why? You asked why? vshred's going to cook you up some f***ing knowledge. Because it's not good for you. Okay. steady state cardio is not good for you. says vshred. Counter-apingian American College of Sports Medicine. All the doctors that study the heart and the lungs. Every doctor that is concerned with health, every professor of exercise and sports science. But there is only one vshred. Let's hear some facts facts. Why isn't it good for you? Because first off it takes like 40 minutes a day. Whatever. He doesn't even know because he doesn't even do it. He's got to know how long he will f*** do it. 40 sounds like a fine number. And I don't have 40 minutes because I hear him f***ing that f***ing cheddar. I got 18 businesses, five side hustles. Can be bought up with a shit. Just to get a cardio session in and you burn what? 300 calories. You could burn more than 300. But yes, burning calories takes time. But maybe he has some good retort here. So if you have to do that every single day and you all see you don't burn calories after you stop. So you continue to burn calories after you stop. But not a ton, so we're just trying to give him as much credit as possible. 300 calories for 40 minutes of horrible exercise. If you're burning 300 calories in 40 minutes, it's actually not that horrible. That's not impressive. It's not fun. So you don't stick to it very long. The verse is doing hit cardio. Okay. So hit cardio, he's going to sell us on the hit cardio bullshit. This is a training fad from about 15 or 20 years ago. Everyone thought it was going to be miraculously better than steady state cardio and they were wrong. Why were they wrong? What he's going to do is estimate later that hit cardio burns a ton of calories after it's finished. And the reality is you don't burn very many after it's finished. So the epoch excess post exercise oxygen consumption was always over-estimated with hit cardio from the very beginning. More, well, more recently 10 years ago we found out it was vastly over-estimated. Making hit cardio not as cool as people thought it was going to be. In addition to that hit cardio is even less sustainable in steady state cardio at a lower level of exertion because it has more impact than it causes more fatigue. So hit cardio is something that people who don't have a lot of time and or are lazy attempt to do instead of steady state cardio in generally fail almost as much if not more than what steady state cardio. Now hit cardio does have a place. It can be part of an integrated program. But so can steady state cardio. It's not one or the other. Hit cardio is not categorically better because yes it doesn't take as long but it also doesn't burn as many calories and know the epoch does not make up for that. And it also beats you up more. So it's more fatigue. I wonder if he mentions anything. This is when you do like 20 seconds max intensity then a 20 second rest and you do that like 10 times. So the work that's only like five minutes and you burn more calories during the workout and after the workout. I guarantee you don't. If you're doing steady state cardio and it's not the easiest thing in the world you can burn many more calories in a 40 minute session of stay state cardio that you could do anything for five minutes long. This is straight up false due to excess post oxygen consumption. Weird. Can this be so science? My name. 20 years out of date. Something that I don't have time to explain here but don't worry. He doesn't know how to explain this. We want more free tips like this. Head over to V-Shred. Funnel. This guy's a f***ing marketing master.

That's how funnels work I think. If you feel like you can't make much progress in the gym. Yes or you're holding on to too much body fat. Definitely. Or your sex drive is lower than ever. My psychiatrist says it's actually too high and it's a problem. But uh... curious. Robmeon. Or you frequently just seem down in the dumps and... Just in life man. It's like... Just a blot. Help me V-Shread. Help me find happiness. Feel like you're aging faster than you should be. I don't know how people estimate how fast they should be aging. But uh... Definitely I'm aging at all. Which is to say too fast. V-Shread. I mean your help. Today I want to talk a little bit about a hormone that your body might be low on. It's not testosterone is it? Which is testosterone. How do I know that? And one thing that's important to understand is that it's normal for testosterone levels to decline as you age. So far so good. Low test levels are something that you should be aware of. Even in let's say your 20s and your 30s. Now the good news is... Good news. There are easy things that you can do from home. I certainly wouldn't be compelled to drive anywhere to improve my testosterone. Now I need it to be at home in I need high test levels. Ideally right now that don't require going to the doctor to slow or maybe even reverse the decline. Yeah. The doctor is only going to give you prescriptions for exogenous testosterone. Which will definitely fix your ass up. Then you got a shoot drug all the time. You're a f***ing f***ing f***ing. Maybe the shred can spare us all that nonsense and get us the real testosterone boosting secrets that we've come here for. In fact, down there a choir, a trip to your local grocery store. The shred. You just promised us we could do this from home. Now you're saying this testosterone cure requires a trip to the local grocery store. Which is not in my home. grocery store? No, that's not going to work. And I'm going to tell you about a couple of natural herbs. Okay, I'll start with the actual science. There is no natural herb that dependably raises your testosterone in a measurable way that has been confirmed, multiply through a plethora of studies. Not phenogenic or phenogenic Greek or whatever the f***ing. Not any of that other weird sounding shit, not triveless, not shit. Sorry, herbs don't do pretty much shit in almost any situation. There are no natural herbs to raise your testosterone levels. But I'm sure he's going to give us the typical bullshit. They're super powerful. They are not super powerful. So you absolutely need to know about them, but there are also a couple of others that are easy to find that you probably have in your fridge or your pantry. I already have steroids in my fridge in pantry. Wow, that just may not be as potent but good nonetheless. I'll just take more of them, same potency. One area that researchers have studied is how your diet can impact testosterone levels. Diet's not in an herb, but cool. And they found that increasing foods that contain testosterone mimicking nutrients and supplementing with certain natural herbs may help. He's not good at reading off the f***ing cards. This does not sound very fluid. But he's doing it, I'm in. And there's two nutrients that seem to be especially crucial to your diet. Let me guess cholesterol and saturated fat. When it comes to increasing testosterone and those are vitamin D. Oh, I was wrong, vitamin D. Okay, excellent. And zinc. And zinc. I know nothing. Starting with vitamin D, according to researchers, it can help boost testosterone levels by up to 90 percent in one study. Yep, this is what we call cherry picking. Most of you, if you take all of vitamin D in the world, we'll see no increase in testosterone whatsoever. But every now and again, people who are vitamin D deficient, see improvements in all sorts of hormones when they in a longer-become deficient. But you're probably not deficient. 200 healthy participants were given either a daily dose of 3,000, 300 and 32 I use vitamin D or a placebo for a full year. Cherry picking. Just one study at a time because we're much as studies that found didly deck for this. He's not reporting them. And compared to baseline values, there was a significant increase in total testosterone levels, bioactive testosterone and free testosterone levels in the vitamin D supplemented group. And once study, they actually restricted zinc and young healthy men. Don't do that. Eat normal foods that have zinc in them. Found that after 20 weeks of losing, test subjects saw a significant drop in serum testosterone levels. And oysters are a great source of zinc. But f***. They just randomly like throws a food at us. Like oysters. You don't like oysters. You can also get a good dose of zinc from crab. Damn, this is the f*** an expensive diet. Oysters, crab, what's next lobster? According to National Institutes of Health, a Laskin King crab provides 43% of your daily value of zinc. You don't have f***ing expensive, Laskin crab is Jesus Christ. Kind of advices this. And if you don't enjoy eating seafood at all, or you're worried about mercury levels, egg yolks contain a good dose of vitamin D and beef. Ah yes, finally common foods. You probably eat anyway. How do I say you guys this? Almost all information, which tells you one micro nutrient. One potential beneficial thing it does in a few studies. And then good sources for it is just a waste of your cognitive bandwidth. There are a trillion different micro nutrients, if you include phytochemicals, phytointrancy. They're all available in every food. There's too much diversity to account for. And if you just eat a whole food diet of mostly healthy foods, lots of veggies, fruits, all grains, lean meats, and every now and again you eat some junk food. And you have a multivitamin multibinol tab. You are going to cover everything, all the mechanisms, all the weird stuff. So this one should in a time bullshit, again you're not going to be in a position rug. Oh man, you get f***ing warning. Better eat. Three ounces of crab. You will be sorely f***ed disappointed. So eating some whole eggs instead of egg whites in the morning, or even adding a burger to your diet can actually help you a ton. Adding a burger to your diet will not help you a ton. All right, if you guys like that, we have an extended cut available for members only so hit the join button to become a member. Another food that can actually help to improve serum levels up to Stasron is one that most of you will be glad is on the list that you have a sweet tooth. And that is honey. Oh, thank God. I knew any diet in which I was going to be restricted in my honey and take one that never works for me. Luckily, honey helps with stuff in nutrients and thank God that it does. I'm going to eat tons of it. Researchers have tested honey in both human and rodent trials and they found that honey did, in fact, increase serum test levels likely because it helps increase. Guys, these are incredibly transient low level effects that amount to nothing. Nobody ever got jacked eating extra f***ing honey. See that guy with the veins in his f***ing shoulders and he weighs 350, that ain't honey. That's called trend blown. Loot-nizing hormone, which is a hormone produced by the Petuitary gland. I like when he tries to speak science, he's a two-a-tary gland. I think. So food number three on our list is garlic. This is the worst video ever. Garlic has a connection with another hormone, which is your stress hormone, which is cortisol, which is super important because cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland. That's an important feature, which is where testosterone is produced. testosterone is produced mostly in your testies, and not in your adrenal gland. Basic science fact wrong. Thanks, V-sred. How shock? Scientists have found that if your cortisol levels are too high, which could happen due to anything from lack of sleep, to mental stress. Yeah, don't fix lack of sleep with mental stress, just eat more garlic. You could be blocking your body's ability to produce testosterone. That's true. Let's find out how garlic helps. So if your cortisol is too high, it won't matter how many oysters you eat or how much honey you put in your tea, your tests could be negatively impact. It actually would matter because if your cortisol is high, but your razor test, the balance is what matters. So wrongly and V-sred. And that's why it's so important that in addition to eating foods that could potentially boost the test, you should also eat foods or take supplements that reduce cortisol. Why don't we still hear it? Just suffer. There are no foods or supplements other than advanced pharmacological drugs that reduce cortisol. You also don't want cortisol reduced all the time, because cortisol is a very important part of the stress pathways that actually cause adaptation. So what you want is for cortisol to be very high during your workouts, rapidly fall off after it'd be low most of the time throughout the day. Don't eat garlic before your workout, I guess. Garlic has been linked to being able to do just that. Be sure to, for audacity and false confidence in 11 out of 10. For good advice, somewhere peppered in there, six out of 10. For tons of bullshit that you wish you had never heard, lower my IQ and now I feel sick to my stomach. 10 out of 10 out of that stuff. Why the fuck doing this for living? See you guys next time.
