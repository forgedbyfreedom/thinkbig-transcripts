Use the pen. Oh yeah come on. Hey! Hey! Hey! Alright good luck getting up. Alright folks, this is Kevin. He tells me he competes in men's physique, which I feel like what? A lot of big men's physique's out there, but I'm trying to say. Hi, Bruce. There you go. I compete as you guys all know, rather unsuccessfully, and open body building. Jay had feathers, of course. Very classic. Look at our class kids. And it turns out, you know what I'm saying? We got beef. Because Kevin looked at Jay at one day and he was like, I don't like how your face looks. Stop looking at me. And Jayard was like, you think you have a big chest, huh? I can't believe he was like, no, no, no, it's sign the papers. Let's get this on video. Crazy chest workout. And this gentleman has a brand that's called. Shut up and stuff. Shut up and stuff. And we'll see if Mr. Kevin does just that. If we get a few win per side, we'll let's get to it. Yeah. Yeah, I need an injury. You got to work around with anything? Are you pretty good? Not pretty good. That's good. So you're done to do whatever. Alright. Scott, let's get out of here and get to the origin event. We're going to go to an origin event. We're going to go to an origin event. We're going to go to an origin event. Alright. You see right. You put it in the wrong way. How long have we been training? How many years have you been training? How many years have we been training? How many years? How many years have we been training? What do we do today? I've figured it out. That's a wrong way, not a wrong whole. Alright folks, big chest workout means. Alright, a few other muscles after this. But we begin often, not always. But definitely today, with a compound. Incline press. Get the upper packs. Get the whole packs. Go on. It's going to be really good. Today, we're going to do a split for machine presses. Just as Jared says, the machine here is pretty nice. And we'll work the try. You want me to run your ass? Watch for this technique. Slow, controlled, gentle pause for range of motion. Let's get to it. You can make it a lot harder. I'm gonna follow you guys, but soft falls on the top. Soft falls. Go down, go down, go down. Right here. All tension. Up. Again. Soft falls on the top. Slow. Talk to your chest, but barely. Up. Up. One more. Let's go. Slow, slow, god damn it. Hold on. Pause. Ugh. Go. Push. Oh. How are you? How are you? Sheesh. How are you? That's what you want to see right here. That's it. That's it. And that's the whole workout. We're doing it. We're not moving. Just kidding. There's like 10 more sets. So you guys will notice on here that Jared is going to really push his chest up. Really retract his shoulder blades. Nice, powerful arch-sweak and press them on big platform. He's going to descend to very slowly. He's going to pause at the bottom of the chest. And then he's going to come all the way up. And a pretty explosive manner. But it's accelerating from the chest. It's not an explosion. And just kind of wish I looked like that. I put in years to this. Years of looking after him. Look at me. I look like fucking homework. I'm doing it. Oh, six. Couple more. You got this. OK. One more. Come on. Pause. Up. Go. Go. Go. Rack. Oh, fuck. Beautiful. We've been in this shit. It's just too hot. I was going to only five. Not at all. Another heavy set like that is fast-wish guy. We have an option here to keep going and doing heavy sets for Kevin or to let him cook it heavy sort of five to ten rep range, which is in now. Or to reduce the weight and bump him into a higher rep range. And we're just going to take a rough guess that is a high proportion of fast-wish muscle fibers. I'm going to try to correct about that. Sweet. You know what I'm saying? And that means that he's probably going to benefit from some lower up sets just like this. So we're going to leave him here for a while. These low-wrap sets tend to hit you pretty well. That sets a five to ten mess you up. There you go. Correct, guess. We're going to get out of for a while. And later we're going to do some high rough stuff. Two to four minute rest periods. One heavy compound stuff. The deep break in the prep. The more intense heavy techniques, like super sets and shit like that. I'm throwing in. So the rest periods are short and I'm just trying to get a really good pump. So longer rest periods in the front of the workout. And generally you reduce them as the workout goes on because you're going into like isolation, shit. And that's why usually go like the first two exercises have everything else. This quick like 30 seconds. We'll do something similar. Good, stop Jared. One more heavy set for Kevin. Perfect, keep going. Chastop. Got a pause longer. That was really good. Pause, wait. Good. A little longer, wait. Let's make this one count. Chastop. Up. Another clue. We're here to work. There's slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow pause. Up. One more. I'm right here with you. Be your best. Chastop. Up. Go. Go. Up. Rack. Yeah, I'm so hungry. That's a sick. That was good. That was too pale here. All set here. You know, when you get tired, that's what you want to do. So you can use your Chastop to the springboard. So when you're pausing on the top of the chair. That was a bautonalassem, please. That's why I'm here. Call you on the bullshit. Fly's next year. Yep. Oh, they're full of this soap. I don't know where it's. Well, at least it's going to be very clean. I'll just get the fuck out there. So you're opening up to that wall and you're trying to keep it. Most people only fly to go like this. Yeah. We're trying to keep it out to that wall. I'm really used to pecks. But a whole range of motion. Incline pressing is done. Four sets there. Now we're going to get into four sets of machine-chastoplies. These are awesome. Set them from big stretch. Full contraction. A pause at the top. Different kind of force curve for the chest. They're usually experienced with something like dumbbell flies, which gravity doesn't affect at the top. And all the way control big chest at the bottom. This is temptation to collapse at the bottom. So do that. Leverage your chest up. Shoulders back. And then feel free to cave in. Jared is teaching the technique here. Where you stay retracting, even all the way up. That makes it really hard. But super effective for the pecks. Multiple sets here of anywhere between five and 15. Usually between ten and fifteen reps. And a little super bonus. To the end of these sets, we're going to superset them with wide grip push-ups. Probably to a deficit. Really fry up the whole thing. Let's get to it. Slow. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Go. All the way. Keep your fingers together. There you go slow. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Chest up. Hold. Right. Good. Good stuff, man. Excellent. They're popping out of the skin. Huh? Oh, fuck. Big chest. Ah. Ah. Slow. Mmm. Let's go. Yes, Jared. I'm a more man. Let's do this. Oh, yes. Yes. Oh. Got a pause at the top. Make this one pause with three seconds at the top. Go. Three seconds. Hold. One. Two. Three. And slow. Chest up. Chest up. Right away here for push ups. Slow. Slow. Slow. Deep. Deeper. Pause. Up. One more. Right away. No setup. Go. Yes. You ready? Chest. Slow. Deep. Deep. Deep. Deep. Pause. Up. Go. Go. One more. Bonus. Time to suffer a little bit. Up. Okay. Cheat. Rack. Good enough. Good. Stop. So who want to approach your chest a little more to the exercise? I set it in here. I was saying keep here. But in something back, I mean, like this here. And you're using all pecks. Like this stretch. Instead of being here. I'm sick. Yeah. I exercise way too easy. So here, you're strong. Right here. All chest. Stretch. Stretch. And the extent. Do you not? When you come down, this is the first thing you do. Right. That's like completely taking. You were more stretched here than you were here. Gotcha. So you're here. You want to maintain that stretch the hallway through. And instead of being here, that literally takes the stretch off. Okay. Think about that as you're doing it. When you feel the shit start going toward the floor. Go. Hold it up there. Hold it. What if fuck is that? That was zero. Zero. And that's it. Right to the push-up. Let's go. There you go. That's perfect. That's some half of that right there. Right down again. Zero rest at the top. Barely locked out on come back up. Down. Slow. Deep. Wait. Up. Down right away. Slow. We've got butter from the way up. Deep. On the way up here. Don't see. Deep. Use the press. Up. Come on. Up. One more. One more. I'm going to fuck that. I'm going to let you go. All day. All day. Warrior shit today. Slow. Control. Deep. I want that stretch. Wait for it. Up. Up. Okay. Kick those out. Just push-ups on the ground. Again again. Pull your arm up. Slow. Up. Shoot. Up. One more. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Wait. Use the press. Up. Oh yeah. Come on. Nice. Come on. All right. Good luck getting up. I think my chest grew just being close to that. So Kevin has the interesting opposite problem that I have. He's not supposed to train his arms according to his coach. He says he doesn't want to. So we're going to use it today as that one time. And show him a. Try to exercise that he probably hasn't done. All right. Folks. So Jared is going to be warming up and thus demonstrating the Smith machine. Spell crusher just in the variation. But you guys can try it. Kevin's going to try it today. Jared is going to get it so that more or less the bar lines up just under his chin. And he's going to keep his elbows in as much as he can on the way down. He's low big. So that's hard. The rest of you can probably push your elbows in further. He's going to control the centric on the way down pushing his elbows towards his hips the entire time. It's like for quads. If you're squatting, you want your knees to be pushed forward as you go down. Same here with elbows elbows forward and in all the way deep in a pause. And then all the way up, it's that simple give it a shot. You'll have to adjust the Smith machine position a bit to get it right. But once you get it right, oh my god. Fucking beautiful. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Let's give it a round. All right. Get out of here. This is the elbow issues when he does skull crusher. So I asked him does he do them like everybody else. Which when he's he will do skulls they lie down and they go like this or some shit. This is probably a little better for elbows. I've at least done in a go to the for myself and clients and stuff. Putting your elbows behind your body like this and putting in that position. Really weird. A lot of people just kind of let that weight drop behind them a bunch and it's just like ripping on your elbow, shit load. This is a little more controlled. I like it more. Why should you try to demo overhead looks like you get that mic is a level of a little bit. Oh yeah for sure right now. Yeah. Well I was demonstrating lying down. That's me lying down shoving it behind my head like most people. I'll shove some of my down. Slow. Gabbos in. Yes. Big pause. Up. Up. One more. Let's go Kevin. Slow. I got you on right here. Slow. Elbows in. Big pause. Up. One more. Bonus round. Reposition. There you go. Hit it. Slow. Elbows in. Slow it down. Big pause. Find him in. I'll go way up too. Press. Go. Rack. Hell yeah. Tell me you feel that. Yeah. Let's do another. What the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. Big stretch all the way through here. That's all good. All right. So as soon as you're done with your Tri-Subsettle at you know, you're going to rack, Requisition Superquit. Still grip here and here. Closed grip bench press right away as many as you can. I'll talk you through that. So just first good technique here. Again. That was no both in. Slow. Press. Go. One more. Elbows in. Nobody said. Press. Elbows in. In. There you go. Slow pause. Up. Okay. Yep. Go. Good. Slide up a little bit. Slow. Boom. Really chuck the elbows. Fuck the shit out of me. Up full lockout. Good. Slow. Up. Again. Go. Slow. You got a fucking man. This is how muscle grows. Up. One more. Slow. Slow. Elbows in. Up into a full lockout. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. Slow. Down. Down. Elbows in. Elbows in. Up. Go. Go. Up. Up. Six. Up. Up. We got the chills on that one. Oh, it's really funny. That's a good look. You guys want to hit some poses together real quick for the camera. Sure. Well, this is a good lighting. The way to have a big chest is to do clearly shit like these guys are doing Holy crap. Amazing workout. Kevin, where'd you think? It was awesome. Awesome. I knew how to train chest. Wow, it was clearly wrong. So, compared to what you normally do. Yeah. Yeah. How much comedy less working sets do we do? A lot less. Usually I'm doing like at least 30. I want to do it more than that. No, no, no, no. I was done after the first exercise. That's good stuff. Dude, you are a pleasure to train your technique with instantly flawless. Amazing easy to coach. Awesome. That was awesome. All around. A good pleasure for us. Yeah, what about this guy? I don't appreciate him too much. I told you the color of the day was blue and purple. You come in here wearing red. I don't know if that's. He just got to be different. That's what I was always like. As my biological son when he was growing up, he was always trying to be good. Anyway, guys, give him Kevin a follow. He's a big deal. Clearly. Follow his brand. You hooked up to it today. That's your damn show. You know, if you're trying to suffer and shut up about it, this is a guy to follow and get a chop about it. I'm going to go shut up about a lot of stuff. I'll see you guys next time.
