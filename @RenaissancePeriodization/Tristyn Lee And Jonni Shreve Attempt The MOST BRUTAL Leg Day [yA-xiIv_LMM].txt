Go! Go! Go! Go! I'm back! I'm amazing. Amazing. YouTube is up, Dr. Mike here. List. Some tough years behind us from a racial unity perspective. I don't worry, now hold up, don't worry. We're about to heal all that isch with one leg workout. Mr. Tristan Lee, Mr. Johnny Sreeve. They had their beef, we squashed it. No worries. A little bit of beef left over, but that's getting squashed today. And it's getting squashed by a hypertrophy RP run by the RP. I've got a somewhere in my pocket. They built the workout. You guys will see that in a sec. And there's nothing, there's no animosity and cultural misunderstanding. The high repetition, vomit and dozing, give up on life. Like workout can't fix. How are you supposed to be mad at some shit when you can't even walk? I'm just kidding. Bella's, you'll be fine. Everyone's gonna walk just fine. Isn't that right, Johnny? You've done a leg workout with us before? We're not walking. All right. Tristan, you feeling good? I'm doing good. And that'll be the last time you say that, let's run a perfect. All right, guys. First exercise today is going to be the lying leg curl. Now, we are here at Pure Muscle and Fitness Gym in Toronto, well, Burlington, Ontario, but close enough. And they have like a trillion lying leg curls, but there's only one the best lying leg curl. And that's any lying leg curl really, if we get picky, that allows you to descend super, super deep into the stretch while loaded. And this particular life fitness machine is one of the very few in which you are allowed to go extra low. Now, check out this design really quick. Here is the plane on which your legs will be lying and notice that we have a few inches of separation here for depth. So what ends up happening is a lot of leg curls if you leg curl on them. You come up and then it stops right here and you come up and it stops right here. And that's really a problem because the stretch under load is a huge mediator of hypertrophy. It is essentially not allowed to occur. But with this machine, I can barely even tuck into it, tuck in. See if I can get into it. The stretch is super deep all the way down and all the way up. This part from here to here is critical for a growth. It's going to do an unbelievable amount of muscle damage in the best way possible. This is going to stimulate a ton of hypertrophy. And honestly, it's not even that psychologically difficult in a part of the movement because a lot of it is eccentric sort of passive resistance. Thus, and it also registers really low on the EMG. So this is hugely beneficial way, huge stimulus, small fatigue, way to grow the hamstrings. Let's get into it. We're going to be doing three or four sets of leg curls. I'll be for sets of don't tell the guys 20 reps or so. My rep match hamstrings. Where you at? Hi, hi, hi, my hamstrings. Two, and as if you're going to do another slow controlled deep pause unload. Oh shit, JK. We got extra extra. You get testicle. I mean, you say, he was unloaded. That's why I thought you unloaded an rep. What the fuck? One more coming up. You got it. You got it. You got it. Yeah, slow slow. Take a pause at the bottom of the deep deep stretch and wrap. Good shit. Oh. Good shit. Set one. Like the lyrious of that, and am I said, I love it. No, he's taxing somebody. He's just putting on some tellers to get fired up this. Yeah. Two. Three, one, push. Three, one more. One more. Yeah. Yes. Slow. Slow. Yeah. Yeah. The rest. Oh. Almost done. Slow. Dude, fuck you. Ah. Ah. Ah. Now we'll work again. Hey, bro. Push. Come on. There you go. Three. Nice. One more coming up, and then we get a break. Come on. K. Come on. There you go. Get it. Get it. Yes. There you go. Slow. Slow. Fight it. Fight it. Rack. Raspers second. All right. Sineasy. We got three, and then you're all set. Trust me, you're the fucking man. Let's go. Go. Stay strong. Come on. Jai. One nice work. Good one, nice. Good one. Good one. Good one. Gorgeous. Jai. Nice. Amazing. Amazing technique. One last one. That's a big giant. Big giant. Big giant. Come on. Go. Pull it. Pull it. Very. And then slow it. Pull back. Pull back. Fight it. Fight it. Fight it. E-HOSIMA. Hold. Let's go. Rack. Oof. Fuck. Oof. BAAA. Oh my god. Oh my god. BAAA. I went to another dimension in the last year. We lost you here for a second. You teleported in and out for a little bit. That's it, fellas. Let's walk to our next exercise. Cool. Whatever. It's like KGB towards your ship. Listen. You boss. We'll tell us. Oh, secrets. Yes. Oh. I got to say. So Johnny's an ice-beap pro. I expect that's much from him. Your control on the eccentric and the dedication to a full range. Impressive. Because you are young and as tick-talking about the fun. Yep. I expect you to do some trend-trains type of shit. But you're out here doing the real real. That's what's up. It's only because you're here. I'll get the fuck up. Hey, as soon as I leave, you're like, ah, ah. I'm going to do the blue machine. That's it. Blue, one-glut on a time. One-glut on a time. All right. Next up is the leg press. Luckily it's just like one set. Really heavy partial range motion. No way. Wait. It's with it up. Multiple sets. Super deep. I'm sorry in advance. I'm sorry in advance. I'm so glad to be shared with us. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So leg press time. Hamstrings are cooked. Quad time. The thing with most leg presses is that they're built wrong by people who don't know how to build machines as they don't lift weights. The purpose of the leg press is to stress the quadriceps, which means we want not a ton of hip movement, but a ton of knee movement. Which means we want to lean every back pad deep as far deep down as possible. This might not be the most comfortable thing, but you guys will be all right. We insert some kind of device to lift the hips. So that we get way more knee flexion. So what we're trying to do here sit right on top of this thing. Really prop your hips right onto it. We're not going to be going super heavy. So it shouldn't feel too uncomfortable. Unrack. Nice and low on the machine. Toast point it slightly out. And then as you go down, you let your tummy expand out and you bring your knees out essentially to your shoulders. Big chest. Knees out. All the way down for a deep stretch. He'll still on the machine. One second pause at the bottom. Full extension to a lock out if you like. If not, no big deal. And then again all the way down. Every rep the same ever rep slow on the eccentric. If you notice that during the leg press, you are experiencing a lot of pain in the quadriceps. Something that my friend colleague and training partner Jared Feather, Ithmi Pro says, is when you feel the pain in training in the gym. There is a natural human tendency to try to avoid pain to recoil from it. But we have to remember that we're here for the pain because the pain means muscle damage. And then it's metabolitic accumulation and those things are all at least correlative to our causative of hypertrophy. And so when you feel that deep burning, sighing and sane pain in your quad, you have to reframe the pain as this is something I want. This is something that like I'm a moth and I see light. I want more of the pain. And then go towards the pain is and usually the pain is that deeper stretches, longer muscle lengths lower, eccentric control and another rep and another rep and another rep. And when we do my reps here, so as soon as you get tired, lock out and nod. Because like as many reps as you can do, stay locked out, breathe a little bit. I'll let you know when to go again. We'll do a few more reps and we'll peel you out of the machine and send you the fuck home at a box. How's that? Turn it. When you're joining, Mike's cult, that's how he gets you to get involved in his ball and territory devices. Just try it out. Just try it out. I do. I do. Okay. Wait a second. Don't tell the guys, four sets of leg press, my rep sets, probably two my rep breaks inside each one. So even the first set is going to be like they're going to do like 12, rest like four, rest like three, something like that. Every single set like that, that gives us, yeah, G-Wiz something like 12 approaches to failure in four sets of leg press. My god, this is going to hurt. One, and my last one, come it up. Hell yeah. Make this one cow Johnny. Rapp. Look. What the fuck. What a set into the workout. Come on. Däds it. Come on. Fight it. Fight it. You're a control. Yes, you're a control. Let's go. Oh my. Slow, be. Fight it. Fight it. Slow. Salt. Pause. Go. Go. Stay there. I lost somebody to see Tristan's legs and be like, how much you leg press man is like two plates, like, but properly. One more. One more. I'm right here with you Johnny, fucking push. Move. Go. Last breath. One left. Take your time with this one. That's your apple model. In a full one second pause at the bottom. Go. Go. Go. Go. Back. Back. Back. Two. Two. It's amazing. Amazing. I like what I feel, Johnny. What? What? What? What? It's that that took Johnny's shoe to the cross for you to stretch and go Friday. That's right. Blocking my range of motion. Never given the way of anyone's round. Yeah. He's like, oh shit. I'm in an electrosic. No. There everywhere. I can't get a scared. Leg press. You don't always have to do it this way, but this is probably one of the more effective ways. As soon as the movement starts and you unlock your knees, the slow eccentric means that you are taking every part of the repetition and making it as muscle growth promoting as possible. And then you control it all the way down. Open up your hips, open up your knees, open up your chest. Take the maximum range of motion keeping a tight lower back. Pause for one second at the bottom and you will feel searing pain that accumulates in magnitude. As you pause longer, we want that sort of thing. And then on the way up, feel free to be athletic and then repeat the motion. There is a tendency psychologically for all of us to want to get through the reps. Checklists, the reps. Get it done. Let me ask you a question. This could go another way if you feel free to answer in the comments. When you're having amazing sex with somebody that you like, shit somebody that you love. Shit somebody you just met, but what's up girl? Are you trying to get through it? The fuck is wrong with you? Every single stroke is the point. You're there for that shit. If you want to not turn on pro, pour in on 30 seconds later your voice out. I'm out. Napkin, whatever. I don't even wipe anymore. That's not the way to do it. You're there for the shit. It's the quality time that you're there for every touch every stroke, every movement. You're absorbing the shit. She or here, they whatever the fuck absorbing the shit. The leg press is the same way. It's a weird way of having sex with your muscles that hurts them a lot. But the key point is you're there for the pain to take it all in. Let's take it all in. Three. Again. Oh my god, amazing control. Big pause. Go. Go. Rast breathe. Three hit it. One down. Slow. Slow. Two down right away. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slower. Pause for a long time. Up. Up. Go. Go. Rast. Up. Up. God damn. How many sets for her here? A. Four here. Yeah. And then just one more exercise and it's all done. Pause for a long time. Rast. Rast. One more. One more. But a good one. Take a time with this one. The last half. Come on, Johnny. Push. Hit it. Steve. Up. Rast. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. You know what to do? What do you do? I miss the rear rack. Oops. All's welded and as well. I'll start to talk shit with you. You can't watch this. Hey, hey, do some pussy. You'll all bitch to get out. Get out. Trying to fight you. That's a hard set to look like, guys. Hey. All right. Let's go. Here's what we're going to do, gentlemen. Every now and again. We do something a little bit different. It turns out that isometric contractions are not overly productive for hypertrophy in most cases. Which means if we don't move the muscle, we just stress it while it's standing still. There's some hypertrophy. But isometric contractions are very long muscle lengths. They do actually provide a robust muscle growth stimulus. So what we're going to do today is so easy. It's almost difficult for me to explain it because it's going to sound like not a challenge. Here it is. If I was bringing a line you to up at the same time, you are going to go down. Not to where your calves touch your hamstrings. But one inch above that. You are going to maintain that position until I say up. And it's usually going to be a four or five second count. You come up and then it's going to be a slow descent. And when both people have descended, I begin the count. One, two, three, four, up. Just like that. And we'll see who collapses first. The U2 close to each other is a more of a camaraderie. U2 bullshit influence a thing. This is not a competition because all of the reps are for you. The other person falls, it doesn't matter. You're still in the fight. You didn't be anyone. No one got defeated. It's versus for fun on YouTube. Good thumbnail. But this is this is all internal. Connect with your muscles. And make sure that burn is there. Sound good? One, two, three, four, up. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. One, two, three, four, up. Down, slow. Stop right there. One, two, three, four, up. Down, slow. Stop. One, two, three, four, up. Up, z. Down. Slow. One, two, three, four, up. Down, slow. Control. Stop right there. Do not move. One, two, do not sink down. Three, four, up. Down. Come on. There you go. Slow. Chastop. Stop. One, two, three, four, up. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. I got nothing else fellas. I'm all on a trip. Let me type that into the RP-Pantin' Hi-Purtsrophy app. You can do it, Johnny. Everyone believes in you there. We go. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. Fuh. Done. Success. Done. Johnny and Tristan. Annihilated this workout. The take-home for me are this. The technique was right from get-go. The effort was right. And there was more reps to be done. They did it. And they never slack. They never cheated zero excuses. Sure, you have to wipe yourself up off the ground after you set. And listen, after you do, the next set is up. You guys did phenomenal work. Couldn't be happier. The RP-Py-Purtsrophy app for programming something stupid and insane. You want to buy the app that's on sale soon or already, depending on what this video comes out. I guess have fun. Oh, whatever. Yeah. The gentleman, what do you think? Have this feel. Death. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. All right. Awesome. See you guys next time.
