Let's go Jeff. Whenever you're ready, buddy, whenever you're ready. Jeff, let's go. Give me a second, Mike. The closest thing that happens is failure. Let's go. Let's go. Yo, what up? Clearly I'm Dr. Mike for Renaissance and this is Mr. Jeff Nipperd of Jeff Nipperd. And he was gracious enough to descend from on high in the heavens to bless us with his Elven presence for a psychotic R.P. Leegwreck out top full of myoreps and insanity. And all this done is stopped now. Jeff Nipperd is such an important person. And we need to take such good care from the we have to have a board certified sports medicine doctor doing the workout with us luckily my lovely wife, Dr. Crystal. But you can follow on Instagram as Dr. Crystal is a board certified sports medicine physician. Jeff, if anything bad happens either on top lane or she's to help. That's also going to work. Feeling good? I can't wait. I feel great. I love the intros. And that's the last time we'll be saying I feel great. Let's kick it. I think it should have folded. Oh my god. Let me just pat it. That is real body. What does it look like? Fuck. Okay. I feel like come on. You can do it. No. All right. That'll do. I think that's actually pretty good weight from you. I mean, I did three or four. But I think in the eight to ten range, I'll be pretty crisp. We want 15ish. Oh, 15. Yeah. Oh. With a slow tempo like that. Oh yeah. Oh. Jeff today will be less than coming to the. There will be comfort somewhere today, but it won't be in this gym. Okay. Okay. First exercise is going to be a lying leg curl. We are going to do my rep match something like, oh, 10 to 20 reps sets. Whatever you get on the first set straight. That's the number. Remember that right that down on our RPI. Virtua Fee app afterwards. Trade in. Everyone does their set. Everyone remembers the number. Second set. You have to get exactly the same number of reps again. But you may be too tired to do so. So if you get, let's say 18 reps on the first set. But only 15 on the second. That means you get off the machine. Relax for five to ten seconds. Shake it out. Get in and do another three reps. So every single set matches the first sets repetitions. Brute'sality is here. Awesome. I'm sure I'm the way down athletic on the way up. Good. Couple more. Go. Yes. Slow. That's it. Come on. Have a question for you. How many was that? I didn't count. I just went to zero one hour a year. I thought I'd have had to guess I'd say it was eight, seven or eight. Maybe? Yeah. So I obviously over-estimated my, my loads capacity. There's another softball. I would have failed in terms of I couldn't get it all the way to my butt. Right? But I did a little bit of a, like a little bit of a shrug kind of thing. All right. Pop my hips a little bit to get the weight up. Should I have not done that and just kind of cut it or like yes. Good question. So in the future, correct. Yeah. We count it today. But you also know that no more reps in the tank after that. No. So I would say that you probably could have gotten it anyway. If you hadn't done the shrug, you just fucking tried a little bit. Okay. Okay. But which is why I'm not going to be like, don't just fucking 12 and up 13, man. Yeah. But yes. In the future, generally get it done with this clean up attack Nika's can within a reason. I think I was just thinking like get the weight up, get the weight up. Rather than like, prioritizing the technique first. Yes. I prioritized getting the rep first. Yes. You're saying prioritize the technique first. And then the reps will happen or they won't. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go Mike. Come on. How many? 15. Full stack in it too. Full stack. No, they say you beat the machine. And you get the full stack. However many sets of takes to get 15. Okay. Okay. Go. Slow. Slow all the way down. Finish. Finish. Yes. Slow. As if another. All the way down. Stay with it. Get out for a sec. How many of that? Five seconds. Relax. Relax. That was 12. Slow. Unwrap. Rest a bit. One more left. Take the same. Take some time with this one, Jeff. Well, one good rap. Go. Yes. Finish. Slow. Slow. Fuck yeah. That's it. That hurt me watching. Let's go. Do I do give me a Canadian? Let's go. Come on. That Jordan Peterson. What are you doing? If you're all leg rolling. You're not. Are you even trying? Are you ready, Crystal? Yeah. Accelerate on the Ascent. Yes. Go. Come on. 11 more. One more. 12. Slow. Unwrap. Rest. Get it. Oh. Oh. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Rest. Let's go. Yes. Slow. Slow. Control. And you're done. Good. That was great. I'm glad I'm not the only one who, like, like, stick around when things get hurt. Because you do that too. I feel better. I. Yeah. Otherwise, I totally see them. I'm not. Yeah. I know. It gets harder from here, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Next exercise is the hack squat. But not just any hack squat. The Atlantis hacks squat. They plugged it right out of the wreckage of Atlantis in the ocean. It is a super lit of machine. It's the smoothest thing you will ever use in the gym. It's unbelievable. That's a great thing from a muscle stimulus perspective. Because it's a great thing. The most dangerous perspective because the eccentric loading can be really, really hard. And on the way up at so smooth, the concentrate loading isn't much harder, which allows us to really, really, really get an unbelievable stimulus because you want a smooth machine that doesn't reduce the eccentric. It doesn't increase the concentrate too much. Much eccentric as possible for the concentrate. The Atlantis is where it's at super far range motion as always. Probably three sets here again. And a 20 maybe 15 to 20 repetitions. We're going to do my reps here. So everyone that is doing this machine today is going to get a two my rep. Pause with every single set of top my rep match. It's just you get in and even the first set. You do as many as you can. Rest at the top. Five seconds or so. Do as many as you can. Rest again. Do as many can. Rack. So it's really three sets. But it's nine approaches to failure. Rotality is among us. Let's get it going. Up. Thank you. Good. One more. Rest brief. One more. One. Up. Go Jeff. Rest brief. One more up in your done. Big moves. Yes. Done. Yeah. Next time we'll go two plates. Two plates. Yes. And then you will learn what hell really looks like. In a good way. Oh, shoot. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Good speed. Good job. That's a lot of rap. Not bad. Oh, thanks, champ. Incredible. You sure I want to. I'm going to get a lot of reps with you. That's the idea, Jeff. I got 16 reps. Okay. How do you time your breathing? Because I found with the slow negative and the pause. I do get a little bit light headed. Yeah. You just fight through with high reps. You just keep breathing. Just before you get to the bottom. Okay. And then come off. So you're doing a double breath sometimes on rap. Triple. Okay. Okay. So I was trying to do the power lift or Val Salva the whole way. I was starting to lose. You're going to pass off trying that shit. So I'm listening for rest, pause and rap. Yes. And that's it. And I'm going to control the negative. Yes. And I'm going to pause for about a second and the rest. Okay. Quality. Better to make a rap harder than easier. Rest. Three. Begin. One. Two. Down. Slow. Pause. Up. Up. Rest. Breathe. Two more and you're done with the set. Begin. Slow, Jeff. Milk it out. Stimulus. Pause. Big pause. Up. You're done. Yes. Pause. Up. Up. Up. Up. Daly. Rack. Good stuff, Jeff. All right, baby. You're ready? Yeah. Two. Yes. Beautiful. Rest. Three. Last two. Coming up. Go. Control. Up. One down. Go. Slow. Go. Rack. Yep. Beautiful. Good job, guys. Are you feeling Jeff? How do you mean by feeling? I want to give everything on this one. Good. All right. Then we have to get 18 reps. Okay. One. All day, Jeff. Two. Two. One more, Jeff. Go. Go. Slow. Big pause. Up. Up. Up. Up. I got more and more. I know. One at a time. One. Go. Up. Go. Yes. I got more. One. Go. Hmm. Up. Up. Up. I got more. Up. Up. Hit it. Slow. Yes. Control. Good pause here. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Yes. Holy crap. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Phomas, I'm not trying to be dramatic. Down there, honey, honey. I just can't walk right now. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Let your knees flay forward as possible as long as your heels are still on the ground. The range of motion for your quad system is amazing. We are going to take one to two second bottom pauses. It's going to be awful. Pain. Oh, no, it chast up. Yes. 10 rest brief. Breathe. Hit it. Big chest. Knees forward. Archer back. Up. 12. Push through your legs. It's going to be harder but better for you. Chast it. Yes. Up. 13. Up. Up, Jeff. One more. One more. Into the pain, Jeff. Into it. Big moves. A black. 13. By last set of the day here. 10. Ah! Well, Jeff will do 95 also. Don't go easy on me. Trust me, it's not easy. This is going to be really, really hard. But I want you to do 20 reps. I want you to stay there until you get 20. This is going to be off the plate so it's going to be ultra depth. I want you to wait lifting style, open everything up. All right. Notice how this pushes my quad's out. Yep. Quads out, chast up. All right. Push up instead of back. I'll do set of back. If your quads are hurting, you're doing it right. Yeah. I'm doing it right. Full one second pause at the bottom. I'm on those quads that peel apart. Up. Boom. One. Three more. Up. Two. Breathe. Three. Straight up. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. Chast up. Up. Up. Up. Track. Don't go anywhere. Chill out here for a sec, Jeff. You got 12. We need 20. Jeff, you are capable of this. And the worst thing that happens if you're not is we just peel you out. Nobody's getting hurt. It's a light load. You might throw up a little bit. Let's go, Jeff. Whenever you're ready, buddy. Whenever you're ready. Oh. Jeff, let's go. Just give me a second, mate. However long you need, Jeff. Let's go. You got four. No problem. No problem. No problem. Get into position. Chris, let me right here with you. Breathe the whole time. Deep. Up. One. Yes, beautiful. Breathe, Jeff. You can breathe through the whole part of the movement. Up. Good. No, not in no. Only not in yes. It's going to happen. Up. Up. Up, Jeff stand up. Go. One more. One more in the new break. Yes, the cast. Strong. Good. Breathe. Breathe. Stay here. That's 16. We need 20. We need 20, Jeff. There. You wanted hard. You said don't take it easy on me, mate. I listened. Stand up. One, no problem. Big pause down there. Gather your strength at the bottom. These four, just up. Strong. Yes, another one. Big chest. Big chest. Up. Strong. One last one. One last one to finish up. Come on, Mark. Just up. We're here with you. Breathe. Stand up. Up. Amazing. Amazing, Jeff. Amazing. Yes. All right. Roll out of the way. Crystal's got to go. And we roll. Go ahead, Crystal. She's good, yeah? That's the workout, man. You did fucking amazing, man. Thank you, man. That's fine. You didn't go easy on me. No, Jeff, would you think about the RPI Purchase for workout? Um, honest thoughts? No, please be dishonest. The leg curls were really fun. The hacksquots were fun. The last exercise was... Bruce. Bruce. Yeah. Think of that point. I just... Party described it. It's like a... It's like a string burn in the muscle. Yeah, that's just really uncomfortable. Yes. Unemployable? Yes. But apart from that, it was great. Awesome. Yeah. For you, Massica's out there. Even that part's the great part. Folks, if you're listening to this, whatever Scott Community Guide decides to release if who knows the RPI Purchase App will either be in the Beta U sign-up for it and get it for a cheap period or the Beta period where it's already outpaid Beta so you can go buy it. The link will be in the description. And uh... Listen, it'll hurt you. But in a good way, see you guys next time.
