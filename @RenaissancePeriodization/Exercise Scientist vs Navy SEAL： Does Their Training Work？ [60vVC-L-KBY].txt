Folks, I'm Dr. Mike and I don't know anything about warfare, but these guys do. This is Vernon, this is DJ and they get people ready for their best shape ever in special operations tactics, equipment, and physical fitness. I'm gonna take the physical fitness test today to see how dog shit I am at this. Thank God somebody defending America, not me. She did hard to f**k. Every event here is based off of three tiers, we're trying to develop a well-rounded tactical professional. We will have the first one which is our minimum standard is what we think. If you are on a SWAT team military, things that you should absolutely be able to check the box on and hopefully be able to maintain those for as long as possible. And then we also want to constantly be pushing that needle a little bit further. So we're pushing that to our lead, which is our second level, and then we would call our B-approach. Which is what we are seeking here at the G-DRAF Performance Program and what we're pushing for is constantly maintaining that B-approach status. And being able to maintain that for as long as possible when it comes to operators and guys that I've worked with, it's not just getting them into the game, it's keeping them in the game as long as possible and being able to maintain that level of physical fitness. That's 70%. Well then, well then. All right, so that was like nice and easy. Okay, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I respect it. So the first test in our performance standards is a broad jump. The standard here is going for height and they were going plus 12 and plus 12 for B-approach. The whole point of this is covering ground horizontally, accelerating with a good shin angle, sprinting, moving around a room, CQB, being dynamic, and also the mobility effect of landing in the hips, being able to land into our feet, maintaining the arch of our foot, just a good expression of power, and it's something that anyone can do. You don't need a vertex to check or something, just a horizontal expression of power. Can I take a couple more? Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Find some ribbon, use your arms. You got to stick our landing so I can measure it off your, for me, throw your arms, place your feet. We do have to stick that landing so we can measure it though. There's a flatestism requirement for that. All right, big guy. Aggressive, aggressive, big launch, big launch, violent arms. So it's down, so it's down, by your shin. Which feet there? Which feet there? Better, better, better. You've got to stick in my guy. It's just because the four momentum keeps going, I guess. Big low. There you go. Five four. Big arms swing, low, big! Nine four. Did you have a nine four? I might got a five four. I'll get that standard. Ooh, there you go. There we go. There we go. Then that five, five nine. Minimum standard. That was a very unathetic five nine, but I'll give it to you. That was five nine, number less. That was five nine, number less. So Mike did hit it. Five. Barely. Barely. What we got here is for the trap art dealer. We're going to go for five reps. The minimum is 1.5 times our body weight for five reps. At least going to be 1.75 times our body weight for five reps. And then B approach the wall, A and E four here is two times our body weight for five reps. Like how do you feel like this will come? About this one, that good bro. I'm saying I had a tube, like, you're still here, you feel me, but you know what I'm saying? If you're like, you can hear your pulse. Just pulseing. Two times, two times. Two times. Salin, a wonder. Why'd you self-in? Push. Push hits. Push hits. There you go. Two more. All hits. Hmm. Great sent in guy. Mike looks pretty strong. How do you think he's going to fare on this wall? I'm not too unconfident here. I think he might do well. This is enough traditional strength. We should be okay, but who knows? Put your body weight at Mike. About 240 on the scales. Okay. Yeah. It's all real too. You know what I'm saying? Four. Or he's at 240. So we're at 4. 4. 80. 360. Minimum. Minimum. Okay. Stop and start. Touch and go. Touch and go. To balance just for safety reasons, but control it. And back right back up. Yeesh. It's at rocket science. Hit. There we go, Mike. There we go. So we get fun of us. Hit the brakes where we get to the top. Is this what I did? Yes. So I'm going to trap our deadlift. DJ hit it for two times. His body weight for five reps. Executed and well. Could have won a little bit more. We're going to save some for the rest of the test. Mike, I think you hit 1.5. His body weight. I think it was around 360 with this current body weight. With the worries I took out. Honestly, a little bit better than I thought. So hopefully we can keep this going throughout the rest of the test. I look pretty easy. It's weird. I haven't haven't deadlifted in like maybe eight years or something. That was a trip. Really? Oh yeah. I purposely don't deadlift in our low back injuries. No, it's not that I'm going to be doing this in the fatigue, isn't it? Yeah. But if I could deadlift, I would die with do more. It's what I'm trying to say. Performance. Plast excuses. Plus what I could have done on my best day, I'm a f***ing athlete, maybe brother. You remember that? Whatever you said. Next we've probably got the most traditional movement when it comes to the military training. I pull up. The shoulder joint is a joint of punishment and a tactical population, whether it's come all the time. We spent in the front leaning rest position, holding something overhead, holding a dead bar pull-up bar. So just being able to be functional overhead, good movement of the scabs, good grip, good form, strength, all those extended long positions. Our minimum here is going to be 10 pull-ups. Our lead's going to be 15 and be a pros going to be 20. We're looking for eyes above the bar and a good descent all the way down to the bottom. All right DJ, I'll start. Let me get you. 13. 14. 15. Good rhythm. 16. Yes. 17. 18. 18. And what? 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. I used to be upset that I was not tall, but then I realized my dick was concomitantly short. So no big deal. It's all proportional. 20. OK. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 20. 30. There we go. Oh, oh. There we go, Mike. Five. There we go. Six. You do. Seven. Eight. Nine. Get it? Ten. All the good. Nice, dude. It's all that I thought. Nine. Six. You don't do a pull-up softening all the time. OK. I do them more or less like that. Yeah. Like a two-secondary centric in a dead-hame. Yeah. It's all for aesthetics. Which is important. Huge. I mean, aesthetics matter, like presence matters. When someone walks into a room, especially in tactical profession, like it would de-escalate a situation when someone walks in in a uniform, and they look like they're capable of doing something. Versus someone that's not and everyone's like, oh, I don't feel comfortable now. And we joke all the time. Like if there was a fire in my house and firefighter showed up, and they were jacked. I'm like, yes, my dogs upstairs. Yeah. Versus someone that's like pulling up their pants and walking in the house, and it's like, oh my god, maybe I should go back in my house. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. You run in Coleman's car. You imagine that dude pulling you over? Like some registration. Uh-huh. Yes, sir. You have to be running Coleman. But I mean, you see some of these dudes. We got him in Virginia Beach. Like you see him on the side of the road, you know, pulling somebody over. Like, oh, you better hope you don't piss. I do it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He looks like Bingo. Ronnie is on record saying he was looking to fight people as a cop. And it never happened. He said it never happened. Because every time he would show up, everyone was like, ah. Yeah. I can't see him. I don't know what I'm going to do. Yeah. Just finished the pull-ups. My kit 10. That is our minimum there. Uh, 10 is a minimum for standard. 15's elite. 20's be a pro. DJ hit 22 at a couple in the tank. But we still got Ben's press. We still got farmers carries. We still got a one ahead of us. Next we're going to the farmers. Wake carry for body weight. We're going for distance here. Not only is this loading. Our posture, our position, our grip, our stance, all the things we build on here. GBRS when it comes to building a good tactical profession. But also being able to carry that weight for us to stay in distance, often with operators or people that are in the tactical profession. You're not doing something fresh. We're doing something under fatigue. So being able to support that position for long durations of time. If we're carrying a gurney, carrying a body, carrying someone, a long period of distance. For our minimum here, we're going 175 feet of body weight. Or elite is going to be 225. And then be approaching to be 250 for distance. There is no technique. It's not a time base. Just pick that amount of grip and walk. Or you can see the rubber. Still. But I will say the slow you walked the harder it is. Yeah, 100 percent. One you guys, same time, same time. So you can compare you to why not. One. That's it. Safe we up. Let's go. Block it in, lock it in. Good strong posture, nice and tall, nice and tall. Lock it in, lock it in, lock it in. Finish through, finish through. Just up mic. More, more, more. Let's go DJ. Add a boy. Reset. Yeah. Well done. Thank you so much. Most importantly formed in look too bad there. Stayed confidence, stay tall, no issues. My kid, the standard 175 feet body weight. DJ finished up a little bit further. Be a pro. Now they have the great task of bringing them back. Are we holding up in this? A life, but barely. I was supposed to be a run outside. Her 800 meters. Now, around here, Merrick and Brother, we don't count in communist units. We're... Pretty standard and a selection is having a horizontal press. I think very common in military selections. Pushups, very endurance focused. Obviously horizontal pressing. We also want to be able to meet something. And we want to program a training standard that we can replicate in the gym. So we're not just training for a test. We're also doing something that we're doing 52 times a year. So we chose to bench press, proximal stability, really willing to match stability of the bench. Press something away from us. That is combatives being able to create tension, drive something away from us, that anterior power. We're going to go with body weight here. Our minimums going to be 10 reps. A lead's going to be 15 and be a pro's or a lead's in for 20 reps in body weight. Good, call the. The chest should be super warm up. That is just for help. Wow. Oh, you want excuses. You can't just do an excuse afterwards. Some of them, I just think you were lying. Do you need to shoot before and during and after. So let's see before I just worked out. I just have to go really, really hard life, you know. And no one walks around with as much emotional pain like I do. I mean, I take that every bit of the lift. Let's get one more going. My elbows. Up. So we'll see you later for more excuses. Let's go DJ. Lock it in. Go. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven stay in that rhythm eight. Nine. Ten. Meet the ball. Drive 11. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Yep. Then the shot. Twenty. Yeah, one more. Twenty one. Oh my man. You know, two dollars. Yep. Good to show. And all right. Put you up. Yeah. This is the guy. God damn. This is a excuses. Yeah, like excuses are like a currency except I'm like some Bobway. I'm pretty much shit off and they've eaten. Scott, what fraction of the day are we out here? Twenty five eight. Twenty five eight. Twenty five eight. Ten reps minimum. Fifteen. Fifteen. No. Twenty. So yeah, three or four. Like if I was really trying to try and shit, you'd more just pull the cork off. I bet just like, I'm out. I'm gonna come myself too much side like nine thousand. For how many reps? You can't count that high. I can't you, pal. Two. There we go. Back. We're doing clusters. Are you want to like? Was that it? Was that it? Like does that? Does that's a can of if I do it in cluster? No, no, no, no. No. All right, now I ask promised. Excuse time. I already used a few, but I remember them. So new ways. Like again. Full of screparations that you're trying to whack. But I don't even know anything. Yes. Also, I just had surgery here. Like drive. I can't use it. And to be honest, like, I'm just in a point, like emotionally. We're like my ego is like pretty good. I just like don't need to back up. So that's three. And a surprising turn of events. These I hit 22 as expected and my kid too. So didn't expect that, expected a little bit more hands on a bar. But you know what we're here to be surprised. You know, we're here is a moment where enjoying it, we're experiencing this together. And we're all having fun. So we started with like these are serious life and death standards. An operators via pro and we're down to like, hey man, everyone has their own spirit journey. You know what I'm saying? Get that. Okay. Okay. Hey, mental health. Mental health is a big thing. You know, mental health awareness. I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to have you leave here with mental scar tissue to last forever. You know what I'm saying? I also have a lot of physical scar tissue. We want to leave you good pat on the button and have a good day. You know, send you home with some balloons. Stand low there. The last time I had a head of the butt and balloons were involved. It was a clown also. And my second try to trust us, I just keep bringing them out. That's a weird process. They had exam, but it was highly effective. From the next test, we wanted to go with a body weight standard for core. We tossed around a lot of ideas of sit ups, hanging from a bar, he'll clicks above. But the army did that quite a bit. So just trying to find an exercise that's familiar with the tactical population, that's something they can program on their own. They can provide a progressive stimulus to with time or weight. So it just made sense. So when I reckon on the lower back with our head flexors, with the traditional tests of like sit ups and flutter kicks, for here the minimum is going to be two minutes, a lead's going to be two minutes, 30 seconds, be a pros going to be three minutes. What were aiming for? Because watch out to get more, too. I haven't yet. I saw a guy watching another play next. I mean, he was a gig when his ass got injured. So not as funny as it used to be because they definitely cleaned up the language. It's not a family movement at all. What? I mean, they still have some, but it's not. What is in jelly medicine? It's not heavy. You're a lot more. What movie was it that I just saw that had like a warning. I'll throw it at it. What do you want? They had like a warning now for movies that from the 90's, like some of these jokes maybe highly offensive. You're like, what? Two minutes. I'm going to do a for both of us, man. Don't I know a play for me? Rest with me, guys. This is my kid two minutes, which is our standard DJ. I want a little bit further, be a pro, three minutes. I thought that was going to happen. Ready? Time starts. Now! Next we got the 800 meter run. We wanted to have an aerobic event. More capacity focused. We spend a lot of time sprinting whether it's short durations. Those 40, 50, 60 intermediate sprints opening up to those 400 meters. We also want to have an opacity moment. So that's what we want the 800 meter run. It's also pretty standard with SWAT testing. Minimum standard here's going to be three minutes 15 seconds for 800 meters. A lead's going to be three and then be opposing the anything under two minutes and 45 seconds. Really taking the slow and steady thing serious, huh? This is fast for me. Run against the wind. They were running against the wind. Scott, you didn't got to work. My shins are gone. Ha ha ha ha. This hat makes them look like the empire here. That's sort of hat. You can run in a lot faster with as much wind as getting on that thing. Five, there's a total left calf. The other one. Yep. No split. 30 feet. Yeah, that's all. 30 feet. They're like my Kiwi spot. Shit. It's trippy. I'm barely out of breath. But my calves are done. My shins are done. I mean, just repetitive motion, repetitive motion. I just don't ever run. Yeah. Luckily, the grappling and shit has my cardio, okay? Yeah. It's not my f-ing legs, or like, uh, sorry. Let me do the racially appropriate thing. My legs are fine. Aye. Just wrapped up the 800 meter run, DJ ran it in 242, which is that B-upro level. Mike came in at a blistering. Five minutes and 30 seconds. I mean, you should have seen the wind just blowing through his hair. It was amazing. Um, but great test. Wrap it up strong. A lot better than I thought it would be. But glad DJ wrapped it up set the set the table set the standard. Be a pro at everything. Mike pretty consistent along the way. We knew the run was going to be a thing. But he's healthy. No injuries. Wait. It's not been thinking about this, uh, battery of test you guys have, kind of a sports science perspective. I think it's, uh, very innovative. I think it is very much the standard that you want to be shooting for. Because a lot of standards are just carry over physical fitness standards from way back in the 60s or some shit. Yeah. Back when our understanding wasn't as specific to the task as it could have been. And so you get this like what five mile run and a bunch of push ups. And that's cool. That means a generally good shape. But a lot of the situations run into and, and, uh, tactical pursuits, moving a heavy object out of the way. Someone goes down. You have to pick them up and run out with them. Breaking doors down, putting hands on people. That limit strength, which is very well tested by the rep's of bench, pull ups and stuff, explosiveness with broad jump, athleticism with broad jump, which I illustrated, I think, excellently today. Myself or fine may say so myself. And I just did. I gave myself permission. Yeah, you did. And so I think it's just, uh, it's excellent that you guys are in the space, promoting a logical standard. And you guys all have a combat experience to go with it, which is, you know, because if I make, make beliefs and ship, it even makes sense. No one's going to believe me as well. They shouldn't. Guys, G-Barris is absolutely the gold standard. If you are in the coastal Virginia area, look at them up. And, uh, a really good idea is find out where they live. It just bust through the door in the middle of the night. They're never armed. They don't shoot on site. They'll be fine. See you guys next time. Yeah. Yeah.
