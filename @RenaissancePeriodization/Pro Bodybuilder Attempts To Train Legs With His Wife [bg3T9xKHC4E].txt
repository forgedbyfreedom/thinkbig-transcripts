up. Oh, breathe. Almost got to in your gun. Sheep. Sheep again but go slow or we don't count him. Now. I'm going to do it. Alright folks, we are recording this video the day after Valentine's Day. So here's how Cuban by the fuck of putting his arrows in his sheet. Blue offers a little dumb ass baby wings. And looking from the fuckers' shoe and he looked at me and he's like, oh, you're married already. And I'm like, yep, so Dr. Crystal, he's like, what up? I'm like, what up? Alright, you're good. Keep flowing. Flying on. Here's Max Shit. Then he flew over to Mr. Jared Feather. And he was like, ha ha, I'm a zapped this dumb ass. And Jared was like, just grab the arrow. A few Vegeta theme. Not today, cute bit. And then he just crunched it in the arrow fell. The cube is like, holy shit. He flew away. And then Cuban flew his dumb little ass to these two lovebirds who are clearly in insane romantic love. Actually, they weren't until yesterday. When Valentine's Day, they were actually standing like this. Like, she was in front and he wasn't in the back. The cube is like, oh, watch this. Damn. I went to both of them. They're like, oh god. And then they got the arrow out of it. Oh god, we're in love with each other. Let's celebrate how real lovers do. What is the quintessential unity in love? Every really romantic movie, at least two here. Hey, hey, Jerry, you beat me two. Hey, and oh, oh, I have evidence. Titanic. What happened to them on the floor? Nothing good. Romeo and Juliet, that turned out okay, didn't it? Great. It did. Today, couples like day. We're on a journey. We're on a journey. I'm a match made in Kevin. But I don't see any heaven around. I see a big ass dragon back there. They're looking like an angel. We're the fuck as cute when you need him. Cuban is taking the day off. Works so hard on Valentine's Day. Jerry, we're going to step in and get warm. And you guys feeling loving the air? We're about to die together. Oh, that's that romance. Holly with time. Hit it. First, seated leg curls. I don't know what I'm doing this. My rep match sets as usual. Because in our opinion, isolation exercises like leg curls, you're in the old already. It's easy to rest in the machine. It's easy to approach failure multiple times. With my rep match as a reminder, or those of you who do the channel, would you one set very close to failure? That's the baseline set. That set number one. The first set is the straight set. The set after is a my rep set where you take those 5 to 10 seconds breaks in order to get those totals. That'll be the theme for kind of the rest of this work. But don't tell our lovely two contestants because, uh, yes, kind of bad news for that. Fuck that. I just tell them what to do. Let's get it done. Touch it. 22. 23. I'm trying to hit the back. 24. One more. 25. I'm actually like a wrap. Very good. So 110 pounds. 25 reps. Remember that, okay? 4. 1. 1. Let's go. 5. Back. 1. Yeah, that's wrong. Amstring. J.K. We're going to change the weight out. 1. Come on. Go on. Damn it. Rest. Reef. Push yourself back. Kips back into the pad. Good. 3. 3. Go. 1. 2. Come on, Kevin. 4. Go. Go. Oh, yeah. Rest. Do it when you're done. Up. Yep. One good one. Smash it. Yes. Slow. Trow it to the end. That's it. Great stuff. Beautiful. 3. 2 more. Go. Oh. Oh. Press. Press. We won't count that one. Take a breath or two. You can't do it. You won't count that one. Hit it. Oh. 1. That was good. Hit it hard. Yes. Slow. And that's it. 50. Beautiful. Get me out. 2. 2. Go. Go. Go. Go. Press. Do it when you're done. Up. Yep. One good one. Smash it. Yes. Slow. That's it. Great stuff. You don't want to hear sounds. Go. Go. Yes. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Slow. Rack. That's it. Good. Stop. That is great stuff. You guys feel good? So we're done, right? You guys see this last year. You guys see that last year. Everybody got jokes until the hacksawating starts. Go. We're not nice people, Jared and I. Everyone knows this. So we've been doing a lot of pretty heavy hacks. Today these folks are going to do something much harder than that. They are going to be doing hacksawats. We're going to try to pick a load that they can wire up their way. Per each set to about 15 to 25 reps. When you're going to start with a weight that they can do 20 to 25 reps with. Keep that weight pretty close to the same. And then fatigue will break them down from there. My rep traditional style this time. So even the first set is going to have two or three little five to ten second breaks. So you get a little bit more wind in their sales. So again for another few reps. This gets us close to failure multiple times throughout the set. Which means after this we just don't have a lot left to do. We're still going to do some shit. But we like at RP to take an exercise and really build a fucking dog shit out of it. Do milk, dog shit, is that where dog shit comes from? You guys know what I'm saying? Really do it right. Really do it intensely. So you don't have to do 50 different exercises in a gym. And when you pull up your shit on your, you know what I'm saying? RP training at the shit will say tax once and you're not thinking oh man. Wish I could do more. You're thinking back four sets of this. That's find out how the flow's like. One lower slow slow slow up. One more go right now slow slow control pause up. Yeah, oh, breathe almost got 200 done shit. Begin but go slow or we don't count them now slow patrol there. Just up deep up last one go slow slow slow slow. Pressure. Up stand up. Yeah, yeah, wrap. Wrap. Wrap you're good. Oh, fuck. 20 half. All day today all fucking day slow. Up strong. Again down slow slow slow slow slow. Stop stop. Stop. I'm doing this all by myself. Go go go go breathe don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere. Lock your legs out. Lock it out slow. Up. One more go slow slow pause speed. Go go go go go go. Wrap. Up a little. Good. So this is about in the third mince physique guy. We've had on the channel that's bigger than a classic physique bro. Mince physique bro, classic physique bro. If you, he's going to do a classic this year. We turn pro mince physique. If you guys follow bodybuilding at all in the comments, let us know. Should mince physique have a fucking wake cap. What is this shit? He doesn't even train arms. He doesn't even train them.

You can rack it. Very amazing set. Amazing set. Amazing set. You might be less forceful out of the hole on the first few. Just so you can feel for keeping your heel down. Okay. So I'm going to give a shit about you being as fast as possible on the way up. Just really push through your entire foot so that we whenever it gets hard. You can focus on doing that. Okay. You want to, you want like probably five reps pass where you should have last night because you're going up on your heel again. Yeah. So we're here. Oh, I felt it's a little bit too hot. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're like I said, we're saying you just fucking sit in the bottom. I'm done. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You got three more. Wait off. Okay.

With the usual. We're not going to do anything non-traditional. Love in almost every culture universally is consumated by doing lung squat supersets. Yep. As many lunges as you can pretty much. It's fat. Look it up. Good. Just go and go. You can just go to the line. All right. So. We're going to do walking lunges. This way and back. When you feel nice and queasy, we'll tell you to come back. As soon as you come back. You can put your entire body on here or you can do a half. No big deal. Slightly wider stance. Hands up. Slow squat. Now watch this. As I squat. My pelvis is going to tilt backwards. My chest stays completely vertical the entire time. And I'm pushing my quads forward as I'm staying on my heels. Such that at the bottom I do one of these and hold for a second. And then come up. Sound good. So with your lunges. Stay nice and upright because we're trying to get the use some loop but also some quad focus. Nice and upright. Take a nice long step. Slowly bring your knee gently to touch the ground. Most of your weight on your front foot. Come up. And then begin again. Four more steps. One. Two. Three. Don't you touch your front legs. Slow. Up. Up. Right in. This is your last set of the day.

We've traded a handful of couples now. And a lot of them do really well. You guys are at the tip of the spear. Colour me impressed. Just incredible effort, incredible effort all around. I just tried to pack Kevin on the back for a good job. And my hand just soaked in sweat. This man is at 100% sweaty mess. All I have to say to you now, sorry Jared, go ahead. They're all the time actually. They're training partners. All as per since you're dying, compared to normal, you guys do like how many exercises for legness. We do at least like seven or eight. Seven or eight exercises, how many sets? Like usually three to five, three to five, one to seven to eight exercises. Today we did three to total exercise. Three to total exercises, which just three sets four sets each. You guys want to do more? Four to five, four to five. Four to five. All right. So what I thought? All right. Now, the only thing I have has a message for both you, the viewer and YouTube is go home and make sweet love. That's cute, but in 10 minutes. It can't be a game. Let's don't get a hand in whatever you get off the ground. You could just do it here. Fuck it as drag as leg, baby. We're Gucci. See you guys next time.
