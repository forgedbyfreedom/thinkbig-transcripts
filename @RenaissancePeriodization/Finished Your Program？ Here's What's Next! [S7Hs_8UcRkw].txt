Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for NS�psPirudization. Welcome to video number 12 in the building your hypertrophy mesocycle series, the last video in our series. And we've been building all of the hypertrophy mesocycles through the series with the RP hypertrophy app. It's new, it's great, it's amazing, it'll be your friend, you want a little distance and you just need a quaintance, it'll do that too. Link in the description to buy it, give that some thought. Today's video is about how to make your next mesocycle after you've made your first one in successfully completed your first hypertrophy program. What do you do into the next one? First, consider what training block you are in for how to design your next one. So for example, you could be in a muscle game phase, you could be in a fat loss phase, a maintenance phase, or an active rest phase. You could be in all those phases and you'll have to design mesocycles for them specifically. If you were building a muscle game, mesocycle, you just did a muscle game one and the next one's muscle game. You just build a normal cycle in the app, you don't have to specify anything because this app is optimized for muscle game. If you're building a fat loss, mesocycle, you don't have to tell the app you are in fat loss mode. One of the interesting things that people have been requesting and eventually we're going to get this done anyway. But they're like, hey, does your diet app and training app talk to each other? The answer right now is no, and the future it'll be yes for some other reasons. But the training app doesn't actually need to know what diet phase you're in because it's auto regulation. It's algorithms for a pump, you are a sore, you are your volume, perception, fatigue, etc. It handles automatically the transition for muscle game to fat loss, so it's already going to be the best fat loss mesocycle builder that you can have. So you don't need to tell the app extra anything. Now, if you're doing maintenance in the app, you're going to want to keep it to one to three sets per exercise. And if you're getting very sore or very pumped, you're going to want to manually reduce the volume. And every single week that you do, your maintenance phase, you're going to want to click pushed my limits on your workload questionnaire portion. Because the app is just going to not add sets anywhere. You don't want the app adding sets. So for maintenance, the shortcut is just hit push my limits start with a low volume, keep the low volume the entire time. For active rest, I would just say do a D load week at the end of your month cycle and then take the next one week entirely off of training. That counts us two weeks of active rest, so no problem there. Now, when you're building your new mesocycle, you go and you have this as example, we did legs and Toronto together. The Dildo Mezzo we just did last time that's green box here means we're still in the mezzo, but I'm trying to show you guys how this works really quick. So what you would do is you either go here to the new or you all the way to the left and say plan and you measure, they take you to the exact same screen. And then you just start building your mesocycle and of course, you picked your sex. You pick which day of the week you want to begin your mezzo for simplicity, you can choose a preset, which means you've got all these options in here. Good God. Oh, and we'll let me choose a preset because I have chosen a sex yet. Oh, come on Mike, we'll say I'm female today, I feel female. Choose a preset, you've got all these options. Six workouts per week, five workouts per week, four or two, all this stuff. These are all preloaded plans. As a matter of fact, let's say low about a three times a week. We can just do that. Now you can also create a custom mezzo where you build it out yourself. But if you do lower about a few times a week, it'd continue Monday, Wednesday, Friday. It's already picked all of your muscle groups that you want to train and all you have to do is select the exercises. If you get really lazy and we're going to make this feature better and better over time, you can go here to the option and just say auto fill. And it'll just auto fill the exercises with suggestions that things are a good idea. And then you go down a second, that's good. That's good. And I want to do bodyweight squat. I'm going to do something else. And I'm going to say front squat, you can change it. No problem, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then when you fill in everything, you can even delete some of the user's hand. I want to do quads today. But I'm going to add and say I'm going to do more by steps work because I'm trying to be a bro. I'm going to do by steps. I'm going to do barbell curl mirror grip. And then you create the mezzo and it creates the whole thing for you. So making mezzo is in the app. I mean, she is you can make a mezzo in a minute if you want. This is a big deal. Eventually, we will allow the app to be a portal or it trains other people for you. You can DM them in the app and train all of your online clients. That is coming. The engineer's will kill me for saying this. I will not put a date on when it's coming. We are working on it. But right now, if you are a personal trainer, you can build as many mesocycles as you want for all of your clients. It takes a very little time. And they are just all going to be here on the screen. So when you go from mesocycles, as you build more and more mesos, you just fill up and you have your clients name. You have the description. Anything else you want to do with it? So when you can already use it as a personal trainer to train as many clients as you want. You just have it there. You know exactly what they are doing every single time. Soon, as soon as we can, we are going to allow this to do online training as well. And that will be a really big thing. But to that end, when you are making the mesocycles and you are trying to choose exercises, I would say consider reusing exercises that you most enjoyed and are making the best progress for you in the last meson. Over time, we are going to make the app smarter so that it begins to suggest which exercises you should keep in which ones you should replace. Absolutely, we will get to doing that. Lots of stuff to do before that it will get there. But for now, you just pick the stuff that you like that you are progressing on and then you can vary anything else that you want. At the end of the day, I would probably say just pick exercises that you really enjoy. You get a good kick out of and they are working well for you. They don't hurt your joints. They give you good pumps. You are making progress on them. There's you can always do that manually and it will work every single time. Now, when it comes time to doing exercises that you've never done before, you will not be picked your loads you go. But if you are doing the same exercise over, last mesonated barbelled mesonated, you got to 15 reps of 150 pounds at the end. What do you choose this time? The recommendation is you go back to week one of Barbell Bentro exercise in your last mesocycle. You see that you did 130 pounds then. I would increase that load by roughly 5% probably no more. Put that in as the load that you want and then go from there and then you will get 5% stronger again over the next mesonate. That's not always going to work if you are more advanced, it might be more like 2 to 1.5%. Something that will target the same rep range that you want. If the same rep range is your target. So if you are doing sets of 15 to 20 in a bottle of that rose, pick a weight that you can progress with starting out. That's at least 5 pounds heavier than the weight you started in your last meson. Pick it next and then go from there. If you're feeling great, if you're really blowing it out of water, make it 10 pounds or 15 pounds heavier in my recommendation is be conservative. If you discover that it's way too easy, you can always go up and increase load and you haven't even gotten too much fatigue. Something's way too hard away to heavy can beat you up and you're less than learned of when in the next week or right in the next session to decrease the load. That's a problem. If you missed the load and you first working set is sucks, you can just take that works at weight. If you say, I'm just going to start this over and pick a new weight or you can make duplicate exercises. And if you make those duplicate exercises, you make it with lower weight, the next week, you just delete that first exercise, the duplicate set of the new exercise and you go from there. So this is something that is so tempting to get wrong because you're like, well, look, if I just assign myself more weight, I'll have to get stronger. That's not how it works. You want a weight that you can handle for the rep range, you want with good technique. And if it's only ever five pounds more than last time, you can do like six mesocycles a year or no problem or like eight. Forty pounds of increase and strength, five times a year or whatever, that's huge for reps, you're going to get way, way bigger. If your body is growing and you're getting stronger, faster, you will know. And then the side of a little bit conservative and then go from there. Do not chase progression at the expense of technique, mine muscle connection or your stimulus to fatigue ratio. Don't be like, I have to get 155 pounds for 15 of bar above rows or I haven't grown. Well, if you have or haven't grown, that's already done. That's not up to you to decide. That's all biochemical. So just do your best with the best technique and if you're not progressing, you can look at why. Maybe it's because your technique has gotten so much better, that it's more challenging and you really have gotten more muscular, but your technique is the thing that was like, hey, like, so much better now using less weight. I've had years where my technique improves and I don't get stronger in the exercises. I said my chest and my quads and my dulse just going growing growing. And if I go back to my old technique, I can double the reps and like, oh yeah, I can't believe I used to technique that was a shitty. I had great squat technique that I watched videos from 10 years ago where I was squatting to depth and all that stuff and I was like, man, I'm bouncing out of the hole. I'm using a crap load of lutes and lower back. This isn't like a super upright modern type of squat that I do. So don't get too addicted to the weight progression they should handle themselves. Challenge yourself just a little bit more every mesocycle. And if look, you're growing a ton, then your reps are going to start skyrocketing. And in the middle of the muscle, you'll have to add more weight than the program predicts, which is totally great. All right, folks, that is it for our series. Thank you so much for tuning in. The RP-Highperrophy app is live. It is for sale. It is awesome. People are using it. Some people even love it. They say some people are in love with it. Link in the description. Give that a look and I'll see you guys next time.
