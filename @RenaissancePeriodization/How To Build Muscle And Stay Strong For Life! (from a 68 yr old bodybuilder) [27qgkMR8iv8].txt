Music Hey folks, Dr. Mike here, Jared Feather, for our science organization with Raymond Sonsossey. Yeah, you got it. I'm trying. I'm trying. That's pretty good. He is the founder of the entire Atlantis brand. And of course, we're here at Atlantis Gym. And he is sullen. Oh, I don't want to say it right. Sixty-eight. Yeah. Years young. And Jack, and he is going to show us how he trains. And we're going to ask him all kinds of questions about what he's seen growing up. Why he got into fitness and maybe what you can take away as an older individual, trying to stay in the best shape of your life. Let's do it. to it. Something to do like 15, 20 reps. Sure. Just warm up. We used this machine like yesterday. Yeah. It was amazing. Yeah. It was amazing machine. The smoothest machines ever. Even the cable stacks are so smooth. I'm like, I was going up. You know, when you've been tweeting the machine for 40 years, that's the, to try to improve. There's always room for improvement. Sure. Training. Why did you start training at all? I was, you know, seven, eight years old. I went to the basement of our house and I saw a box of magazine, muscle building magazine because my father was training back then. We had like 10 pounds dumbbells, 5 pounds dumbbells. So I tried some exercises from the magazine and I cut up the pitcher, put some scotch tape, you know, on the wall and each time I wasn't my bed at night I said, one day I'm going to do like this. So you've been training for 60 years. Yeah. My first contest. So I went to the gym. I got a member in the San Timber and in March, it was a contest in Montreal. So after six months, I went to the contest again win. But just for the trail to go on the stage for me, it's a, oh my god. So after that, I won the junior Mr. Monthly All-Katech after a year. So at 17 or so. Were you eating a lot or no? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Because I gained like 30 pounds in that year. I remember I had 16 years old, I had 16 inches of barn to be honest. I was following that year, you know, 17, 17, 18, 18 inches of barnman. Yeah, 18 inches of barn, 18 inches of barn. Listen. Yeah. Yeah. My was training like the six days a week. Great job. When did you win the Mr. Canada? You know, I won Mr. Montreal for a music comeback. Eastern Canada came third twice in Mr. Canada. Those year was the best year because you could compete naturally. So I went to I built him in 78. I came second. And the year after it was Mr. Canada, here in Montreal, 1999. As prestigious, the Plasties are. And it's like, the guess pose or the idea. I want the Mr. Canada. I saw the picture of it there. Oh yeah. How did that feel? Oh, it was great. Because my dream was to be Mr. Universe. And because I won Mr. Canada, I was the guy who represented Canada in Mr. Universe. But I understood that you need to have, you know, other things, you know, than training. Sure. So I was afraid, you know, of those things, you know. I'm not pretty to be that. I don't know where I'm going to go with this, you know. So I stopped. I opened a gym. I saw that was not a result by then in 17. But I didn't have the money, you know, to buy those machines. I said, one of my friends taught me all to well and out to build the things because I have a financial degree, you know, bachelor degree. So I didn't know all to well. So I'm going to make the machine like the way I think, you know. My first machine was a power rack. Oh, yeah. That's all I remember. I didn't have a power rack. Where did the company name come from? In 1986 I said, I want like more commercial name. So for me, I saw a movie. I planned this. And apparently it was healthy people. And they took their own house. It bounced. It's a really nice name. It's a great name. You've been working out a long time. Common mistakes people make in the gym and prevent them from having the best games. Sometimes they know they take too heavy. And they do like half-movement. Yeah, you have to train with the kings of four-injim motion. Arnold and all those guys back then. They were all there for movement. Yeah. I don't know about the technique today. If it's going or not. But I can't see that. For me to do it's only half of the movement. I don't feel, but some machines, you know, that you have on the market. Sometimes you cannot do the full movement. Most wide-process. Yeah. Or some chess movement. The machine, the weather, done. It's hard to make full movement. And also, they want to grow fast. Me, it took me like 10 years to win this weekend. It takes time sometimes. It takes time to make a decision. I have decayed. I know it's to do something. I think. So the workouts typically don't take more than 45 minutes. Yeah. I think the idea that it was overtrained. Yeah. It was hard on bodybuilder. You know, it was like crazy, a little bit. And after that, you know, I had some discussion with all the bodybuilders. It was a little bit too much. You don't need to be too hours in the gym. You know, but a good training. You know, I feel it. You know, I can feel it. For me, it's like, it's a, it's a wheel of life. Yeah. I have a lot of passion. But my passion, if she said, you can take only one, it's going to be training. Like any measure you're a very successful person. Successful and sport. Successful and family. Successful and business. What, anything you can say to the folks at home watching. Your top tip. Just for anything you do. How to be successful. What is something about one word? Perseverance. I went four times to win Mr. Canada. You know, working out maybe nine times a week. And, you know, during four years, I did that. So, but that I wanted to win. So, I had to persevere in order to do my things. Even in business sometimes, you said, I'm tired. I had so much things, you know. I'm going to continue. That's probably the key of my success. It's perseverance. It's very inspirational. That's awesome. That's awesome. That's awesome. Raymond, Mr. San Francisco, thank you so much. I was so glad you guys were here. You just got your learning a time for you. Hopefully, Jared and I can become a third of what you are. This is it. The man in the myth of legend. Thank you so much for tuning in. See you next time.
