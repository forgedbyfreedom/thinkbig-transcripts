Real talk I had no idea what the fuck you were 7 Racks Devon Devon, Devon, Paul, Paul, why? What? Awesome Folks, I'm Dr. Mike for our sounds presentation. This is Mr. Tristan Lee for Tristan Lee for the show. And in any case, we got this together. I looked at Tristan. I thought, My God, that guy's arms are huge. But, Tristan, what is the size of an arm that is big enough? Is there even... I don't think so. Which is why we're going to train arms. We're going to do it using the RP hypertrophy app as always. And by always, I mean, recently since it's starting to hit. Pain is on the menu, but we already trained legs and Tristan possibly never flinched a single time, which tells me he's a cyborg from the future. And this arm workout should be a breeze. But prepare for pumps. Do you have some kind of stringent little situation under there that we're going to be exposing later? After I get a pump, yes. And that is the rule of the day. 1, 2, 3, let's go. 1, 2, 3, let's go. Which in the overhead, easy bar extension. This is a great, amazing try to step exercise. I no longer do it because I have so much trap. I think that I can't even get into position anymore, it sucks. I used to love this exercise. It was yours first, it was responsible for a huge, huge fraction of my try to step growth. The big cues here are to keep the elbows pointed forward, and then the other side of the arm. It's like wrong with putting them out, except it brings a little bit more shoulder into the equation. If you point them forward, it really just ends up being all triceps. So it's a small matter, but a matter that I think can make a very solid difference. That's a big cue. We're going to be going to slow on the way down. You've got to go deep. People don't want to go deep on the exercise because it humbles them with how little weight they have to use in the end. It's not about how much weight you use because there's nobody keeping track of that. Hey, how much weight are we using? How much weight? Nobody gives the shit. Do proper technique, the nice food, deep pause at the bottom stretch, and a full lock out of the top. Then we're making money. We're going to do four sets here, 10 to 20 reps. Super high quality. That's the first thing I want to say. The second thing? Why is my hoodie up? Because Toronto Canada is a high primary. I don't want to be seen by the wrong games you feel me? Up. Fifteen. How goes in? Slow. Go. Go. Sixty. Now it's time to go. Go. Sixty. Now it's time to turn it on. Let's go. Elbows in. Good pause here. No rush. Speed. Yes. Go. Go. Go. A grab. Hell yes. Hell yes. Life won. Yeah. Yeah. Technique never broke down a single time. Up. Go. You got one more. Let's go. We're here to go hard. Elbows in. Deep. Up. Go. Go. Go. Yes. I'm back. Oh my god. Amazing. 11. Very good. My grab drop off for arms compared to like legs or anything else is so much higher. They drop off more for arms. Yeah. I think I know why. Or I have a hypothesis at least. You have really, really gifted arms. And I think they're probably stronger relative to the rest of your body. And also bigger and also more composed probably a faster twitch muscle fibers. And that tends to mean that because of all of those factors independently am combined, they just don't recover as fast. Which is a good thing. If you have muscles that recover instantly, they're probably small and slow to which and they suck. Mm-hmm. Like anyone that can just like back to back do the same number of reps. I'm like, you need to get bigger. You're either training like a pussy or you're of a bunch of slow to push. Yeah. Yeah. You'll get bigger, but maybe not as much as you would have if you'd be. Yeah. Seven. Two more. Deep. Eight. One last one. Opposin. Deep. Head down. Up. Up. Up. Yes. Oh, my God. Perfect. That'll fucking do. Hey, no one in the last year. I was like, shake it. You can feel your quads dancing. Why am I quads camping? I've had my quads fully cramp on an overhead press before. Your body hair was actually very terrifying. Yeah. It was actually very terrifying. All right. Let's take it easy for a sec and then go do dips. Let's do it. Very cool. Now that you don't have try-subsetting more. Yeah. Cool. Good and I'm right. Yeah, let's find you a box. Sure. Go a pie. Yeah, that way you can just stretch out. We'll also have some man ready. Is that one better? Is this small one? Oh. Yeah. Overhead, try-sub extensions are done. Four sets of somewhere around 10 to 15 reps. And we have that logged in to the RBI Perch Fiat. Excellent. Now with dips. Type the inner body weight. distance weighing around 150 pounds. 147. Ish. And these dips are done in a special way. We don't want to come forward too much. We want to stay more upright and come down. It's not ultra comfortable as far as how much strength you're able to produce. But it is ultra uncomfortable for the try-sub-sets getting stretch under load, which is exactly what we want. We want a measured descent, full pause at the bottom, and a full lockout at the top. Four sets of dips. Yikes. He can do like 40 dips normally. Fresh. We'll not be getting sets of 40 because the try-sets are super super pretty exhausted, which is perfect. Let's get into it. Up. Six. More. Deep as you can. Up. Up. Seven. Rack. Oh my god. Seven dips there. Four. Four. What? What's that? Awesome. That is awesome. That tells me two things. One. You are really hard on the overhead extension. You're trying to set your shot. And two, the technique you're using here is exactly the kind of technique that leverages the most into your try-sets, the least of everything else. And it just makes them a huge limiting factor. Yes. Six. More. Up. Seven. More. You got this. Deep. Go. One more. Again. All the way down. Up. Go. Rack. Oh. Hell yes. Redemption. Good stuff, man. Five. Up. Couple more here. Deep. Six. I see that nose touching. One more. You got this. Up. Be athletic. Lock it. Lock it. Well. Yes. Hell yes. Oh, shit. That was the rep of a century, sir. Holy shit. I felt like a century. Fuck. Bicep training time before. Can I ask you to fill something out really quick? Just do it. Just basically how did your whole tricep situation feel. If you just answer each question, just kind of wondering what you think about this whole system. Definitely was my little excellent. That's it. Boom. You need like a death option. Like I died. Or if you just don't fill it in, they know you died. Yes. It's like a 30 second time. You're really. It just messages 911. It's like a 30 second time. We want a maximum stretch on the bicep because stretch under load is a big thing for hypertrophy. So what we're going to do. Have you stepped forward? You can stagger step if you want whatever is best. Big chest at the bottom. You don't want to be here. This stretch is the bicep's a lot. And then you arc through and come up to here. You don't have to come up like this just to hear slow and controlled. Big stretch at the bottom and a little pause. Boom. Big stretch in a pause. Boom. Makes sense? That's good. One slow. Big strike. Finish. And as if another slow. Trash up. Rack. Phenomenal. So guys, my rep match. Whatever number of reps, trusting gets in his first set. We're going to write that down into the app. And then all the other sets after if he falls a little short of it. He just takes a tiny little five second, ten second break. And then finishes however many reps he has to. Oh, shit. You got a few more. Four. Oh, my. Go. Go. Go. Slow. Now, don't go anywhere. Just stay right there. Finish. Last one. Up. Up. Up. And as if another slow. Big chest. Big chest. Big chest. And Rack. Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. Jesus. Yeah. That works. That fucking works. One set left. Seven. One more. One more. Move. Yes. And then slow. Chastop. Rack. Excellent. Another four. One. Ray technique. Two. Three. Pause at the bottom. Go. Slow. Chastop. Pause. Rack. Nice. Easy rest. Two when you're ready. Oh. Yes. Now, slow. Big chest. Big chest. Pause. Rack. Oh. Shh. Fuck, yeah. Let's go kick them all their down, yeah. Let's do it. Last exercise. For today with Mr. Tristan. This is a standing two arm dumbbell curl, but it's done very special style. We took the Jared Feather Jerry curl. We modified it to be even more extreme. So here it is. And I'm glad you're here for this. We are going to grab the dumbbells. And, well, actually, without dumbbells for now. Typically, people curl like this, which is totally fine. What you want to do is pre-stretch the bicep, which means you're going to the entire time have your chest up and out. You're actually arching your back and leading back. And you take all the dumbbells all the way back here. You come up high enough that it's a little easier at the top. You pause for just a fraction of a second. And then slow a centroid of the dumbbells. Slow a centroid all the way down. Pause. Slow a centroid just like that. Give it a shot a couple times. What happens if my arms fall off? We will get someone to plug them back in and you'll do a few more reps. Go. 11. Slow. Up. Go, go, go, go, go. Slow. That's 12. Couple more. You got this. Up. Up. Up. 13. Chest up. Chest up. It's not going to make it easy. It's going to make it harder. We want harder. Up. Go, slow. Chest up. Chest up. Rack 14. Good. Yes. Holy crap. Unluck by step is just so far. I don't know why I'm in luck when sometimes one of them just gets asked. Yeah, I know. Good stuff, man. Chest up, chest up, chest up, chest up, chest up, chest up, Good more lean back. Yes. Nine. Chest up. Keep it up. All the biceps stretching my man. One more. Big curl. Yes. Yes. Finish. And then slow. Ooh. Rack it for a bit. Four more left over. Take your time with this. We're on good reps only. Good reps only. Three. Chest. Yes. Make your quality. Finish. Is there for another? Slow. Slow. Rack. One set left. Beautiful work. She's... Dude, fuck yeah. Tell me you got an arm pump. I can't feel my arm. I got it. I don't know what that means. Two. Slow. Chest up. Go. Slow. Slow. Slow. Rack. Let's finish your fucking great workout. Big chest. Everything right. Two reps to make it right. Yes. Slow. Extra slow this time. Yes. Beautiful. Everything you got. Good technique. Move. And then ultra slow. Fuck yeah. Rack. Dude. Oh, fuck it. Hell. Solid. Thank you. Listen. Real talk? I had no idea what the fuck you were. As far as a human being. I knew he was a celebrity or whatever. It's like celebrity. Please. Please.
