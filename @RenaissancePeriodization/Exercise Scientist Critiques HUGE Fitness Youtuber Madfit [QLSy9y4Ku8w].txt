Today I'm leading you through a 15 minute toned arms workout without any equipment These are tough. These are tough videos to critique just your body weight's not gonna do a lot, man Well, let's see what she does maybe I'll let you eat my words. You're going to draw a little tiny seas Okay, yeah, I mean yeah Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for RP Strength I am a former professor of exercise and sports science It's a matter of fact I'm a PhD in sport physiology a GG at sub-black belt and I body built in lift weights and workout and So does mad fit in saying fit a young woman Who's helping other folks get in shape with her own mega massive YouTube channel and we're gonna lens in and some of the stuff She's saying take a look at her training take a look at her diet recommendations and see if we can make any sense of anything and say some nice things And say some critical but all while man love and respect things three two one become very angry mad even Today I'm leading you through a 20 minute full body workout that is all on the floor Scott how come when I'm on the floor moving my body gy rating very minimally dressed The FBI doesn't call it a workout but it calls them a kind of tape that you can't just hand out to people and public and expect them to not sue you I'm calling this a lazy workout Okay, we're gonna do a lot of yin and yang today Scott on the Plusside It's kind of a cool admission that look I know you're not gonna work hard I'm gonna try to give you the best workout in the context in which you were actually able to do it I love that respect me people where they are on the other hand The idea that you can lean into laziness and still get a lot of really good fitness results is It to some large extent for many people in the illusion If you're looking for the easy way out and you get the lazy go work out you're probably just gonna get zero results You're probably lazy about your workout to lazy your gains You're probably too lazy about your diet and Too lazy about consistency and you're probably gonna fail so while it's possible that some people do benefit from leaning in to the lazy Admitting it and just doing their best and and there's tons of that minimalism is a really cool thing on the other hand It's kind of like if you can help yourself and try to challenge yourself a little bit Don't lean into your laziness that might also help too Don't anyway, all right. I'll joke side. Let's see what's going on I don't mean all jokes aside. There's gonna be plenty more dumb jokes at press into the floor Nice neutral pelvis rolling up through the spine pressing the hips all the way to the ceiling What is the color of her outfit and water bottle? What color is that Scott? I don't know but I love that they're matching it's like you don't match an arby do those with the fun I don't have a sense of taste off cucumber Yeah, yeah, I think good. Do you think that she has Element in her shake there? I mean I hope so but this lazy girl workout or sure she's gonna sweat a lot she needs a leg. Okay, TVH She probably does not need any element if you work out really really hard And you look spell lots of fluids from pores by sweating then element can be a great thing to dump into your workout drink To make sure you're rehydrating all the electrolytes back not just the fluids element link in description One of our sponsors of the mat. Okay. Let's see what was when we're done. Okay. One more snarky thing And I mean this with all do one truly a percent love in respect I'm hideous and I know this are her feet pretty big Scott, what do you think I think they're normal really? Do I have small feet? Oh, that makes sense That does make sense and then trying to hold the squeeze and the glutes as long as possible Ooh good idea goody center control really connecting with the glutes the sus great and not so lazy So if you're really lazy, it would just dump right on the ground not in the literal sense though You could also do that the disgusting workout Great, I love it. I love it. I love it. As we come down Dang in this position. We're gonna do some slow Crunches lifting up towards the ceiling. Well, this is lazy like you just in one position lined out of the ground and you're like lifting Cool, okay, and then control same thing trying hold that squeeze in your abs as long as possible Thank you about bringing those ribs together as we come up and keeping a space in between your chin and your chest So neck is nice and long Cool, so the long neck frankly does nothing at all and you're not gonna hurt your neck by bending it in any particular way when you're training The cues for the crunch are very good trying to really shorten that midsection and really lengthen under control is really awesome One of my questions about workouts like this in general is like how close to muscular failure and thus a very effective stimulus Percept are we getting here like this is cool for just moving around and if you're like really trying to get into Fitness, but you're very out of shape. You just don't train at all. You don't move much This can be like a really cool few weeks of introductory movement to your body Is it gonna get you in the kind of shape that she's in? Almost certainly not she probably trains with specialized programs included for shoulders arms chest back legs Abs and glutes each one with male and female options You get them all and can use them as often as you like even building off of them to make your own customized versions For only about a dollar a day click on the link in the description of this video to get started and So basically yeah, you want to train to look like her You can do this for a few weeks and then once you're in better shape. You see those dumbbells next to her You're gonna be getting them shits and you're gonna get off the ground You're gonna walk around and lunge as you're gonna squat so you're gonna press as you're gonna rose and Really challenge yourself really push the pace because that's kind of the only way that You can have results that look like that We're gonna lower those toes down and then bring them back up so we're doing a leg drop in this position This is a cool exercise because it shorts the lever arm by bending the knee Which means that you don't have to overstrain yourself if you're not a very good shape Straight leg lowering is really really tough and it also means you won't like flip over while you're doing it It does limit the exposure to length and tension at the bottom your abs aren't super stretch because your toes touching you come back up But again, very much in line for the in a very introductory exercises that are going on again if you feel your back Starting to come off the floor you can just slightly lower the toes and then bring them back up They don't have to touch the floor nothing wrong with your back coming off the ground totally totally fine Your hip flexors actually pull up against your spine and thus bring it up no big deal at all lower Bring the knee in towards the chest and out as you bring that knee in make sure you're keeping this Same height So directly out from the hip and don't let your body fall back. We want to use our core Now the lifting leg part does does train some glutes and a little bit of a bleaks The coming up with anything Doesn't do much Hello everybody welcome back today. I'm leading you through a 15 minute toned arms workout without any equipment These are tough. These are tough videos to critique mostly because I really have a thing for White background plant based minimalism and how can it look Scott look at the scene? But I'm a serious note seeing a side You guys there's no way to train your arms with just body weight Maybe I'm gonna eat my words in a second Scotchy picks up the plant and starts curling it you're like damn Okay, yeah, you know we're allowed to use shit in the room Let me go on this rant for you guys for a second It's totally fine to ask the intellectual question of How little can I do and still benefit? Like if you are totally over the career thing It's totally fine to ask like what kind of job can I get that'll pay the bills and give me as much leisure time as possible to pursue my hobbies totally fine But there is a floor to answers of that question that are valid and in just the same way asking how little can I do? Little measure does any way time Of the workout intensity of the workout Frequency like do I have to train five times a week and I train once and Even do I need to use weights at all like do I need to go to the gym? Do I need to have dumbbells do I need to have bands? Do I need to have anything and There's this totally normal totally cool natural human desire task okay if I do this little Can I still get something that I can be like hey I'm working out? I'm getting a benefit and up until a very low point the answer is yes and Surprisingly if you're really creative and you guys can check out my appearance on the diary VSCO podcast where I talk about this Jaws would like 15 to 25 pound dumbbells and one bench and maybe not even a bench You could have excellent physique results in many cases with just man really an hour total per week of training Two very intense sessions notice the tradeoff to intensity twice a week But we also have to admit something that yes while to a point doing less can still get you something meaningful There's a drop off there you guys it to wear like yeah just your body we're just gonna do a lot man This is a real thing well, let's see what she does maybe I'll be eating my words I'm always impressed with a cleverness like this is very creative like I would have never come up with Sees shit. I'm doing eskachi's like that's a G you can get it. I'm like oh god damn I'm doing a little loop at the end shit. Okay. Yeah. I mean Yeah It's a weird feeling when followed somebody and They've been vegan for a while oh boy vegans stay calm stay calm. I will say things about the get us a minute second and then they come out and say that they're not vegan It's kind of it's like a total WTF moment. I Decided to include a very small amount of animal products into my diet because I wasn't feeling my best I'm still pretty much plant-based like I would say my diet facts Check this out vegans Plant-based diet has a very important Three operative terms in it Plant-based diet diet self-explanatory Damn it. I chose the wrong finger Plant self-explanatory. Let me just leave these off based When a diet is based In or on plants that in Typical understanding of human language Seems to me not to say that it is bereft of everything else Like when you say the Asian peoples have a rice-based diet Which they do It is not that you're saying the eat only rice because they don't Having a base of something can be understood to Represent the fact that is the majority of the intake that may be as the most high frequency food that it Composes the vast proportion of calories or nutrients that the eat and that is all facts What based is not supposed to convey Is that it is the only thing that they eat So it turns out the vast majority of people in the world short of like carnivore dieters or Inuates who eat a mostly meat diet you could even say a meat-based diet Almost all diets are plant-based you guys most human calories come from plants and not from animals as consumed And so the term plant-based diet I can't tell if it was developed With all the best vegan intentions in mind to be a fuscatory to the idea that it's really just the vegan diet Which is what it actually is Plant-based diet. I tell people I eat a plant-based diet. They're like you eat meat all the time like yes That's correct but I eat the vast proportion of my calories from plant sources When I go to Chipotle to get a burrito I get a tortilla Scott plant-based or not Rice how we doing so far beans And then I get chicken and I get some cheese sauce Chicken and cheese sauce is like one fifth of my burrito by volume and one third by calories That is a plant-based meal you guys there's no other way to say and I don't need to take the sales out of the vegans who are in I think the final maybe that final it sounds a little dramatic In the long term of history are going to be judged is just more ethical than the rest of us and really more forward thinking and kinder I think in the end the vegans win I think once lab grown meat becomes a possibility here in the next I don't know how many years I'm sure it's this shit switching. I absolutely have no intention of hurting anything ever The idea that animals have to suffer from I asked to eat a food that feels nice to me in my mouth is dog shit But at the same time I really like clarity in terminology and so when you say plant-based diet that's saying almost nothing at all because almost everyone is a plant-based diet What you really want to say is vegan diet. I know what's the sales tactic? You say all plant-based because people like typically associate Unfortunately vegans with no offense fellas no offense statistical accuracy Psychotic socialists That hate you and will throw things at you and they'll spill red ink on you and you wear fur And they're coming almost always from the best possible place. I mean like industrial slaughter of animals Is it really fucked up now? It's a nuanced perspective because if you can take a really good steps to make sure the animals are not suffering You let them live at or above their naturally expected lifespan You inoculate them from almost all disease completely save them from predation So like pasture raised cattle for example Is by no means clear doing an ethical thing you can say well you're restricting animals freedom But the animals have like a understanding of a epistemology and enough to know that agency is something they really want Probably not cows sure shit not and so if you're raising an animal way beyond its expected lifespan in the wild In a quality of life that is objectively higher than it would get in the wild and then you slaughter it for meat That's probably not an ethical really an ethical is Suffering plus plus then some Narly fact reforming which I think should be some combination of I don't know about outlawed maybe outlawed But definitely like I think most people who have the money should be buying food intentionally That's ethically sourced with animals that are having a good time until they're a little older and Way older than they'd be in the wild and they're very humanely put down and all all this great I think that's totally fine But on the vegan side there's this huge huge advantage of like dude killing other things for food is kind of And it kind of is But if you speak clearly and address your vegan concerns say look I'm not gonna call plant based I'm a call that vegan you know why cuz it's vegan and That's a good thing because the vegan diet is a morally superior diet period It's got if I was like a more of a man else fear guy and a carnivore dude I could have really interpreted this video totally differently huh? See what I'm talking about man This is the implementation of our society brother First they want us to turn vegan so our hair falls out Then they want us to drive preuses Scott what else can we say What what's next The globalists Down the drain we go Anyway, folks, there is still more video to come but we have a members area where you get an extended version of this video every other exercise science critiques videos tons of vlogs and vlogs from Jared and myself training in the real world tons of nerdy stuff Little bit of extra money tons of extra value give it a click somewhere around here And back to the video right now. There's no I've struggled a lot with my hormones I've struggled a lot with very very bad period pain It's been something that I've been struggling with pretty much every since I'd gone vegan came off the birth control pill And I started to include animal products I started to notice a big difference I was struggling so much to the point where I was at my breaking point where I I was just like Ready to completely give up. I was struggling with really bad anxiety depression My skin Well, that's intense husk out Was horrible and the pain was Absolutely insane like The worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life to the point where I was throwing up Every single time I got my period because the pain was so intense Well, that's fucked up. I sure hope Maddie gets her shit sorted Here's the thing for folks that need to consume animal products But they're ethically vegan but their health isn't allowing them Definitely of course number one is try to make sure you check all of your supplementation boxes More protein more b vitamins and any talk with chatGBT will tell you exactly what more you need to be having If that's not working then the next thing you can address is absorption issues sometimes you think you're eating enough of something But it's getting absorbed out of fifth of what normal people normal people you're totally normal The average person can absorb and so you just need a lot more of it sometimes that helps If that's not a thing that is effective You can consider moving into animal products that are ethically acquired and that is actually a possibility because V in check this out If the average insert animal here that you're gonna be eating parts of lives 10 years in the wild and Typically dies in a really f-dup way and by the way almost every animal Every animal in the wild dies when they're just get older and their body isn't good enough to do normal things anymore And they break a leg trying to climb a tree for food and they just like Scatter around the ground and starve to death slowly and agony that's a real world There is no pokahonus paradise out there does not exist If you can have a situation where you're raising similar animals Scatter yes in this case we're eating squirrels in this example And you know instead of 10 year average lifespan You know every animal you slaughter has to be at least 15 years old or something like that or whatever the the analog is here And so it's outliving its natural Comparator group on average by a long shot and also it's Inoculated against any kind of diseases that we know it gets antibiotics and all that good stuff Which by the way are very good for animals because it keeps them from rabid bacterial infection Is that a way more f***ed up and at the same time they're completely protected from predation Then the and you know and they're allowed to roam in a very huge enclosure and Socialize with their animal friends and their families then all of a sudden it's kind of like Had it actually happened a better time in captivity and then when you consume their animal parts later You're really kind of like not doing anything that seems ethically off limits for animals and so Then it's time to get into Basically the kind of farming practices and consuming animal products from the kinds of Producers that follow very ethical practices and I didn't no matter where you live You're gonna be able to find some ethically sourced animal products eat them to the whatever minimum That you need to fuel your best. It is a many plants as possible to fill the difference That's probably the way to go but for most people I will say if you're not particularly attached to the idea of eating meat and You want a consider going vegan It's not gonna improve your health because there's no health difference between vegan and I'm never a diets if you factor in like everyone's eating healthy food and controlling it and take a V excessive calories But it's just as healthy and if you supplement properly and you keep track of your health It is definitely awesome to be in a world where you're not contributing to animal suffering at all Yes, I know that if you eat farm foods that are plants you're killing a ton of squirrels and rodents when the fishet gets Farmed again You have to ask the question of do those rodents die any worse or more painful of a death getting chopped up by a combine Then they would getting torn apart by a jack-old answer is no, it's probably better for them to be killed by the combine Yes, I do mean that so on average because all animals die If you were a vegan you're causing less animal suffering than if you were meat eater Never mind the fact then again in addition that meat a meat eating Humans consume the animals that also consume the grains so you're consuming double the grains and some effect even much more than that Because over its lifespan the cow eats way more grain than you will ever eat And so all that taken together. It's a really good to be a vegan vegans get my utmost mad love and respect and And That would be great if more people were vegan do it smart so that you don't have to come back and say veganism doesn't work Because most of the times it does for some people at work It won't work and then ethical farming of animal products is where they're the way to go Give that some thought and if you're vegan and you're Goth and you have colored hair I'm married but if I wasn't you know what's up? Scott's video guy. I'm saying you can hit him up to Huh Maddie You're awesome you're doing God's work helping people get in shape All my critiques were very well meant and I hope your health takes a turn for the better I've been Dr. Mike and I give this video a what the was this all about why am I saying vegan stuff out of 10 see you guys next time All right that was cool said some stuff all of nurse-necked all good vibes. They do get critical and that's the job Um If you want more of that stuff and there's right here is another video and I'll see you next time
