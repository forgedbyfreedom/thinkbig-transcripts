Let's go right now. Oh yeah. Good stop. Take a break. This is going to be like workout every set two failure. Hey folks, I'm Dr. Mike. This is Jared Feather, IFV Pro. And this is Bryce Adams. And she has the unique distinction that's having the most followers on the OnlyFans platform. And it's the most liked creator on OnlyFans. Which is cool because now we have three top OnlyFans people in the same video at the same time. As you know, Jared is the most requested feet picks of all time through EverCense. He's the onlyFans Jared's feet. I've been described this and Jell like as cathartic as sublime. You won't see them here because y'all motherfuckers go have to pay for that. Yeah, it's where on the other end. But in any case, me, everyone knows this old news. You're the most liked person on OnlyFans. And I feel that. I'm the most loved person on OnlyFans. There's like a secret love emoji that you open up for 59. The gentleman just spray me with love. In any case, my doctor said it was called somebody else and not love. But outside of that, we are going to do a smash and grab total leg workout. Mine is calves. Who trains calves anyway? We are going to do hamstrings. We are going to do glutes. And the quads, you don't do quads. They do you back. Yeah. What do you think your chances are of having just a magical fun time with no tears, no vomit and no rolling on the floor in your own spot? Like zero, but it's going to be a magical time. Magical time anyway, Jared. Any parting thoughts? Just get to the bank. Paying time now. Alright folks, Bryce's first exercise is going to be the good morning. It is also Sunday morning when we're reporting this. It's about to be a bad morning for her. Don't tell her. She can't hear this. Good mornings. It's the hamstrings and the glutes and the lower back. And the mid back. All at the same time. And the way you want them to hit the hamstrings most is we're going to hinge at the hips. Push into butt back. That way. How many only fans related jokes can we make? We'll see. But it starts right now. In any case, nothing you want to look for. If your knees bend a lot, it turns mostly into a glute movement. We've got glutes coming up later. Don't you worry. We are mostly hamstrings. Which is why we're going to take the knee and fix it right in place. Soft lock out just barely out of lock. And then all of the movement comes from the hip. When you feel a painful stretch, that's good. Another big tip for good mornings is to have it down to a predictable bar height where you put it on the platform that can tell you you're doing a standardized range of motion. It makes progression really easy. You're not for second guess yourself. We're doing multiple sets of five to ten repetitions. These centric controls, everything. I'll come back in a bit and tell you guys more stuff. But for now, I just want to address one thing. Why she got a mask on. You feel me? I'm here with my real face is ugly and awful as it is. What's the mask? Well, I'm inclined to believe that she's actually a crying fighting superhero in her other job. Just can't show that shit off. It's like Batman and Robin. Except she's Batman and Robin. I never thought that through. Let's go do exercises. Ooh, got a plus. Let's pause. That was pretty good. Got a pause. Slow. Slow. Pause. Up. Two more. Like the lower back. Big chest full pun. Slow. Slow. Good one more. Big pause this time. Wait for a second down there. Slow. Slow or? Oh, yeah. Up. Raph. Good job. I still find you my rhythm. It's hard. It's hard. It's not fair being a girl. It's technically flawless. Good morning on her second try ever. How does it feel like we are playing? It can be like this. Impressive. Impressive. Yeah. It'll be more in emotion. But I think you have the mobility flexibility for it. It's a little bit. It's a little less. Yeah. Roll us up here. Really push. Exactly. Just sit up and back. Up and back. And then try to open. Open your knees tonight. And then these three are feet. Yep. Exactly. Just like that. You're going to feel a little more. Yeah. It's going to be hard. Okay. There you go. Good. Good. Control. Control. Control. Control. Up. Excellent. Go back. Slow on the way down. Back. Back. Back. Back. There you go. Keep it going. All day. Slow. Slower. Back. Slower. A couple more. Keep it tight. We're back. Got this. You got it. Slow. You've got to slow. Yes. All bright. That was the best one. Gentle touch. You want to touch it as gently as possible. Slow. Slow. Gentle. Up. One more in your done. I think it's good. Slow. No rush. Slow. Back. Up. Good. Back. There you go. You're going to know? I'm going to go back on that. Sure. She hasn't done good mornings and long time. Long time. Time for more difficult things. Okay. Two sets of good mornings. In the tank. She hasn't trained her hamster usually. Center glowed to a while. She hasn't done good mornings and a long time. So we're going to call it there. We don't want to do rap, don't type shit. And training rest of the lower body more. So now we do front foot elevated dumbbell lunges. The front foot elevation is to hit the glutes more because it puts the front loop, which is the one that stretch under even greater stretch. The key with this exercise is to use the front foot to produce almost all the power. And the back foot is just there for balance and support. In addition to that, you want to make sure that you do a slow eccentric movement. Gently touch the knee to the ground. Potentially take a pause and then come back up. Do you want leg? Do you rest a little bit? Do you do the other leg? Do you rest a little bit? And so on and so forth. So sets of G-Py 10 to 20 here. This is going to be painful. The number one requirement is the technique has to stay good even during the painer. So we're occurring here in many other videos. Technique is the foundation on top of that. You lay a good repetitions. All of them are with good technique. So control up. Go, go, down you. Yes, more. More. Slow control. You're doing amazing. Gently up. Up. One more. This is going to be tough. Nobody said easy. You got this slow and gentle. Slow. Easy. Up. Go. One more. Last one. Right now. No rest. Slow. Slow. Up. Up. That's it. Yeah. Good stuff. Good stuff. All there you found it. Good stuff. That was excellent failure because your technique never broke down and you just couldn't do it at some point. That was awesome. Take real break. Keep yourself strapped in and we'll switch legs. Anything like this where your grip can become an element in the back there. It's smart to strap up. Every back session. Every straight leg deadlift. Every lunge. Anything where you're holding onto something for a while. Really controlling easing tricks. Why take the target muscle and make it the forearm so you can just do extra forearm work. So if you're really trying to hit the back really trying to hit the hamstrings and glutes whatever it is, the shoe straps, there's no point having a needle about that kind of thing. I still see people training back without them, especially. And it's like, if you can just actually target the back by using straps, not having the form. This is a limiting factor. Session is going to go way better. Keep it up. Slow. Slow. Slow. Slow. Up. Up. Up. Up. Stop. Stop. Hey, that was great. Did you think I'm going to do it too? Whatever. It's going to be a traction. You're going to take it. That was awesome. Let's strap it on. Yeah. You guys have been done strapped on work before and you strapped on? Yeah. I find it fun. It's hilarious. It's like, ah, I think it's finally like a little power. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Yeah, yeah. It's exactly lunges, but in reverse. The lunges fuck you over and spread it right up. Good job. Let's get one more here. One more. You got this. Slow. Control. Gen size. Stand up. All right. Get really dumbbells. Put them off the sides. Unboke. Back to the 10 dumbbells. Which legs? You got this go go go go go. Time is up. You feel free to have your hands out. Count now. Yes. Up. One more. Woo. Slow. Slow. Up. One more. Down. Right away. Down. Slow. Up. Good. Which legs? Relax for a second. Something to hit her with. Which legs? Relax for a second. Something to hit her with. So it's actually down to this slow control. They check. Up. Up. Up. Up. Again. Come on. Slow. Control. Go. Go. Again. Right here. Come on. Go. Slow. Relax. Gen. Push. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Thank you. Oh. Wee. You did great. You did fucking great. It's like a good kind of hurt. Yeah. You got a house loved having done it in the moment. You're like, okay. Let's get to this. It's always good afterwards. Oh, yes. Do you feel like throwing up or are you not quite yet? No. No. Wait. What? Oh. Stroll. All the way to her. Oh, shit. I'm not coming up. Press. All right. I'm going to help you come up. We're going to try one, two, three. Go. Help. Thank you. Oh. You're going to launch. Yeah. Now we beat you up. Yeah. Yeah. It's quite a waste of time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's quite a waste of time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's quite a waste of time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, bar squats. You got this thing on your back. You're probably close to grip because your arms are not the size of your legs. And what you're going to do is keep your chest upright. You're going to tilt your hips back. And then your knees are going to go on your knees. Go forward. So you're sitting a little bit back and then down. He'll stay down. You stay upright. Sit all the way down. Super deep. Your heel state on the ground at all times. Okay. You're going to use your four. Your chest is up. You pass for one split second. And then you stand up athletically. Go down slow under control. Okay. Stand up athletically. And then after you're done. Oh. Four feet. Shhh. You too. Sort of like. Yeah. That's why I was in fine. Thank you. Some of you probably drink. We're going to play a game called. Any time Mike makes a humble brag, you think it's shot. You're going to be fucked up by the end of the studio. They got some loud music. I can't hear it. Yeah. Yeah. But you're just the first thing that stands up is your chest. You're going to be a lot harder. You're going to be all quads. But just try to stand up from right there. No, no, ask back. There it is. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I call that stripper pulling. Yeah. We try not to stripper pull. Quads. There it is. There it is. Keep it going. Watch. Oh, oh. Hell yeah. Yeah. Now. Let's go. Let's go.

So, like, usually when I tell people, don't do this or don't do that, it gets hard. And that is exactly what they do. Yeah. But even on that last try, you could've shortly shot your butt back, probably quit. No, they wouldn't do that. You're nicer. You're super tough. Okay. Like, you're super successful.
