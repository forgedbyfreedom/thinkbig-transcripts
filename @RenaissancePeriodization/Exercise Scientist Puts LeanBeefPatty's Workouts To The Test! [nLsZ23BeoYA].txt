Guys, you will get more hypertrophy if you do the cat noise at the top if you don't, this movement is pointless. And if they come up and try to inquire us to what is a miss you go- Hey folks, Dr. Mike here for Renaissance Predensation. I'm an exercise on sports science professor at Lehman College and the creator of the RPI hypertrophy app and I'm going to be appraising Oden Beef Hatties training videos to see if her recommendations are up to muster. Lean Beef Patty, prepare yourself. Alright, let's see, can't do a push-up, lean Beef Patty can help you out, let's see what she's saying. Did a lot of push-ups? Three assisted variations. One from the knees, keep torso straight slash core engaged, good advice so far. Booty band assisted interesting. She's using it like a slingshot that Mark Bell makes. Clever would say in the real world this is just going to probably make you pretty uncomfortable and it rides up on your titties and I have titties. And also it does reduce the growth potential of this exercise because it reduces loading at the stretch and increases loading relatively at the peak contraction at the extension. So it does degrade the hypertrophy value, but it can be a tool for progression that eventually when you can do real push-ups you get even more hypertrophy out of the lens and then long resistance and assisted it's just another way to set up your band which makes sense suffers a little bit from that reduced hypertrophy with the lack of as much of a stretch at the bottom but nonetheless pretty clever pretty clever will work. Higher safety's equals more assist thinner band equals less assist yep makes a lot of sense and the end in two thumbs up. Not bad, not bad. Good advice. Let's see what else she has. Dumbbell only leg work out. People are always very curious about this because some folks just have dumbbells, hopefully more than one and it's good to know how if you have only a dumbbell you can put together a competent leg workout. Hopefully a competent leg routine that you can use a few times a week for a few months at a time to get really really good gains excellent posing there as well. Let's get into it. All right first up is heel elevated goblet squats. Three, thy 10, 15 and 20. So I don't know if she means first to 10 then 15 then 20 which means she's doing the heaviest load first then going lighter and lighter. I think that's unusual advice because most people pyramid from lighter to heavier and I also think her advice is excellent because you want to train heavier when you're the most fresh. You can always crank reps and fatigue a muscle with high reps even if it's already tired from low reps which you can't do a factor of low rep training once you're fatigued from high reps because there's just no more juice. Let's see how our technique here looks. Pretty good. If I was really pedantic I would prefer a pause at the bottom that'll probably accentuate the hypertrophic response but these are actually executed very well. I will say that she's on quite a few plates and it's a little bit tough to generate a lot of force when your heels are that high in the air. I would probably prefer a bit of a wider stance, a bit less of a heel support but I'm just being nitpicky. This is quite good. Oh yeah and then so she's gone from a heavier dumbbell to a lighter dumbbell to just bodyweight and increasing reps the whole time. This is awesome. Awesome stuff. And then four sets of 10 to 12 reps I think that is a dumbbell stiff leg and deadlift. She does have a little bit of a curious technique on it when she is in the descent phase and the eccentric phase she's bending her knees quite a bit a little bit more than I would like to see. You want to keep the knee back almost straight but not quite because of the eccentric and stretch tension at the hamstring is maximized because that muscle is pre-length and for you. As she comes up she straightens her knee which is good because it exerts a lot of requisite force on the hamstring to contract concentrically but we know from some literature that the eccentric portion of a contraction especially the deep stretch at the bottom is probably at least a little bit more muscle growth inducing than the concentric on the way up. So I would love to see her. This is very good technique but to be a perfectionist I would love to see her start with her knees back. Another quick thing and this is a mistake people make all the time a little bit more of a preference than a mistake and that is she's looking directly down into the ground and she's rounding her upper back in this exercise. What I would like to see is her arch her upper back that helps you arch the lower back and if you look up and forward and helps you do that helps you push your hips back more naturally it's an auto cue and then also can help you detect if your knees are too far forward and help you push your knees back. That upright posture is not the way to lift the most weight but the mind muscle connection you can generate with your hamstrings and the specific technique to make sure your hamstrings and the limiting factor will occur better for most people if they arch their entire back and lift their chest up. I see a lot of people doing this look down stuff. I don't really know where they got it from but this is not the ideal technique for the exercise. Alright that was very good a couple pointers but in general not terrible. Yes if I saw her doing the set the gym would be like okay respect I wouldn't be like what's that. Alright and now we have 45 degree back raises for sets of 12 to 15. So the first thing I'll say is if this is all in the same leg routine you're going to experience probably an unbelievable amount of hamstring deliad onset so on us in weakness and you won't be able to do this routine very often. I think to begin with this is a bit much I would do half the volume on stiff liganded lift half the volume on this and if you recover well from that and you heal on time for your next workout maybe half a week later you can get back into it and then over time if necessary add a certain number of sets. She's definitely doing this exercise seemingly to target her glutes we know this because people who say target the glutes want you to have her her around it up her back and they want you to sort of look down. The reason they do this is because it tilts the pelvis in such away that the glutes can really help it but it doesn't pre-stretch the hamstrings at time. I will say she's going so deep and her back is flattening out so much of the bottom that this is still a height stimulus the high stimulus high stimulus movement for the hamstrings so we have to factor in that volume which is again why I think starting out with this number of sets can be a bit much for some people but her technique on this is very good. Someone message her I guess you posted this and they said great pick THO and that's one hell of a pet peeve of mine because that's not how you spell though you lazy f***ing asshole you have a strange vibe on your Insta are you unhappy I would file this comment under trying to get laid in the most pathetic way possible I guarantee you this motherfucker is the world's driest dick and if you're the one that sent this to her that's you dog. Alright home back workout I said home back is one word because lean beef patty spelled it as one work I don't know what home back is but I sure hope it's a hard workout superman's possessive the apostrophe before the S means that Superman owns this it might be needlessly pedantic the answer Superman is a movement which trains mostly the spinal directors and it trains them at a shortened position and most of the force is highest in the shortened position making them not a very good movement but an interesting warmup and something I'm not terribly against. Australian pull ups interesting I didn't know they were called that I always called them inverted rows her execution here is excellent test the strength of the broom handle you're using I would also say that it would be who you to use slightly higher chairs than she's using so the bottom you can get a real deep stretch that deep stretch is a very important part of muscle growth process and it optimizes to create extent she has figured out a way to position the bar that gives her two things one it gives her a comfortable position to touch her body to another thing it does well is it's leverished just higher low enough so that you can get a good number of repetitions if you try to do this too high or too low it's either awkward or you're just not strong enough to do a good number of reps which is at least five percent okay so the top hold is not a very good exercise we know two things roughly from research that has amounted over 30 years so far in exercise and sports science one is that isometrics probably are of the three types of muscle contractions eccentric concentric and isometric probably the least likely to produce hypertrophy aka muscle growth and another thing we know is that contractions at shorter muscle lengths when your lats are closer to their peak contraction versus longer muscle lengths when they're stretched out typically are not as hyper-troph so you want longer muscle length contractions typically in a dynamic sequence of concentric in eccentric but if you're going to emphasize one it should be the e-centric. The easier great this is a great exercise I think in order to train to be able to do more pull-ups and in order to get a limited equipment situation of back hypertrophy at home but I would like to see is her actually eliminate that few seconds of top hold at the top as soon as she gets up to the top start even more slowly than she's doing coming all the way down holding at the bottom for a little bit re-jumping in hitting up another rep again emphasis on the eccentric and on the contraction at a longer muscle length rather than shorter. Another great tool to help you get your pull-ups though we get a little thumbs up from awkward nerd girl continuing on she can do pull-ups by herself which is all-term impressive she's just showing off struggling with pull-ups but scared of the band smacking you in the face this is a legitimate fear if you're a man it can also smack you in the genitals and it's supposed to do that to a woman too but there is another way okay a ha she's going to put the safety up and I assume she's going to string the band right there and then you step on the band yes so the problem with band assisted pull-ups is that precisely when you need the help which tends to be more at the top and at the bottom is where the band kicks out and doesn't help you much and precisely where you need the most tension which is at the very deep stretch of the bottom that your lats are getting pulled apart that's what caused the most growth that's when the band steal more of the force away from you the best possible way to be able to do pull-ups when you can't is to use the assisted pull-up machine it's a neutral force curve just like the regular pull-up it's the best your next best bet is a lat pull down and a bunch of rows if you do a bunch of rows and a bunch of pull-downs you get stronger and pull-downs for a while eventually doing pull-ups will be an obvious thing this kind of band assistance I would say is somewhere in third or fourth place maybe in third place before that is a friend helping you get the concentric version of the pull-up up by pulling up by your feet and then you come down under your own power with the concentric as soon as you're at the bottom they help you up again and so on and so forth that allows them actually to help you more where you need it less where you don't and makes a very very good force curve the situation is that you don't actually have any friends and you are too socially awkward to reach out to anyone at the gym to help you also you don't like people touching you and then so you are stuck doing band assisted pull-ups which isn't the worst thing in the world certainly not the best Smith machine leg exercises by leaving beef haddy let's take a look okay the back squat her technique general looks very good the depth is very good if you are interested in the best quad development and you're interested in keeping your lower back feeling as good as possible it would probably be a good idea to turn completely around in the Smith machine you want the Smith machine as it goes down if you have a slanted machine to also come out in front of you but that's going to allow you to do is to get your knees over your toes further keep your heels planted stay more upright that bar path which is the reverse of what she's doing is going to allow you to have your back not be as much of a landing factor and have your quad's really take most of the strength and get your body into a position where quad is the huge stimulus otherwise her technique is good you'll see her kind of sort of rounding out and forward at the bottom and that that is as a consequence of facing the wrong way in a sense in the Smith machine this is not a mortal sin but nonetheless there is some optimization missing here we've got a split squat also done in the reverse direction I would prefer to see it but less of an issue with split squat great include exercise she's doing it very well I would like to see her ideally go a little bit slower on the way down to build a very eccentric and then come up more athletically in the way up she's doing the athletic and we have part very well but slow on the way down and maybe a gentle pause at the bottom I don't even do this myself half a time with the sucks it hurts but it's a good kind of pain I suspect one of the reasons she's demoing it this way is because all of these are ass shots and the way you get to female start them as you show your ass a lot the way you get to male start them is you show your ass a lot god damn it I just figured out so familiar scissi squat brutal this is brutal now she's doing a very good job here in the scissi squat couple of notes for the for the wise one is she's wearing the knee sleeves which will help that bar sensation without them it's an interesting sensation on the back of your knee another thing is you had better hope that plate does not slip holy shit you were going to go flying I think based on the thinness of that bar she could go much deeper take a pause at the bottom I'm talking about don't click get those glutes real close to those ankles that stretches the quads out like crazy crazy crazy crazy and can allow you to get an unbelievable amount of muscle growth for each repetition slowly going down to the descent pausing there for she one or two seconds and then coming up that would take a very good exercise execution with she's illustrating and make it a great exercise let me tell you guys about the RP hypertrophy app with over 28 preset programs already in the app you can choose to make your own you can modify an existing program or you can just run the programs exactly as they were written by e-personal this app programs everything for you exercises weights sets reps frequency the whole thing after every single workout every single week the app adjusts to your unique parameters with every single input we have over 250 exercises in the app with detailed video tutorial links to every single one you never have to be confused about technique or form ever again guessing right now you're pretty interested in the app download the RP hypertrophy app today while Gary and split squat okay very very well executed again looking down for some strange reason I'll never figure out people do on social media she is sitting very far back into the movement that's excellent this is gonna toast her glutes right off of her body goody center control I really can't dog this movement at all this is a plus work all right body weight push work out let's see how this goes okay starting out with a pike pushup it's a fine exercise a little bit awkward and the range of motion at the shoulder and elbow joint is severely curtailed by the fact that your head gets in the way I don't love this exercise but it's okay if you're just using your body weight and the ground handstand pushup for the advanced uh yep very good similar to a pike pushup except harder again handstand pushup if you don't have any kind of supports to push your head through which you need to be even stronger for it's necessarily a partial range of motion movement at the top doesn't work ideally and you know that limited top range of motion is not superb but also requires a lot of balance a lot of setup I'm gonna say something a little bit controversial I think most handstand pushups are a lot more about showing off than they are about getting good high quality training but uh not saying she's showing off she should she's jacked and really strong but uh maybe not the ideal choice okay incline pushup very well executed this is a great movement for folks not quite strong enough to do regular pushups yet the benefit of an incline pushup is as you get lower the exposure of your strength to gravity increases because you're going for more vertical to more horizontal and this challenges your muscles more at longer muscle lengths during the stretch for both triceps front delts and chest making this a very very good choice for movement especially if you can be challenged in anywhere between 5 and 30 reps within client pushups all right decline pushups these are brutal she's doing them very appropriately so it looks quite good and she's controlling the eccentric pretty well if she lifted her head up she could get more range of motion and let her chest touch it round so I'd like to see her lift her head up maybe even archer back a little bit otherwise looks looks very good these are very challenging and not so comfortable because you have to make out with her ground basically I don't have anyone else to make out with so I make out with the ground all the time but it's pathetic and I hate myself every time I do it pushup plus ooh that's cool you do like a little cat back guys you will get more hypertrophy if you do the cat noise at the top if you don't this movement is pointless and you make sure everyone in the gym hears you and if they come up and try to inquire us to what is a miss you go all right that's it for miss lean beef patty overall I think this is great stuff of all of the mega influencers you could have on social media she's top tier because most of these movements are very good their foundational core movements often compound well controlled well progressed well thought through there's so much crap with single leg glue this and one arm across the body that little tiny pink dumbbells lean beef patty's not falling for any of that I give overall at least an A minus to this sort of lifting A minus that's my thing because she could do A and A plus work by slowing down her eccentric choosing slightly more optimal exercises for that bottom end position but overall this is really good stuff if you follow lean beef patty you're in for a whole lot of knowledge and awkward memes
