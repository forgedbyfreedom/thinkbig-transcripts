I'm just letting this go. Too much good footage. You too. Like many people you, and I know you right there are the viewer, have two distinct problems. Problem number one, your arms are too small. Problem number two, the amount of time you have to train them is also small. And that's a big deal, but it's nothing we can't handle. Myself and IHBB Pro Jared Feather, also known as the man with the biggest arms of all time. We're competing at that dish. Fucking weird. They're quite big. For you, they're the biggest all time. Oh sure. But they've ever been. Which is great. I'm just going to be a witness. And we did promise that you're going to do Get Big Arms Fast. But we meant with that this workouts fast, and you can do it and workouts like it, and we'll talk about principles in a bit. And then you can get the biggest arms you can get genetically. While doing this fast. Fast. It's really, really, really, really, really, really great. We like to do it by taking two, just call the qualification. That's the logical foul. The fast was the workout. The big arms was you will get something like big arms doing our fast workout. Will you get the big arms fast? No. Now, it should take some months, years. And we're not going to lie to you on this channel. Just in the clickbait. I guess. Here's what we have for you guys. Jared is only going to do. Two. And taginistic supersets. Buy a step and try a supersets. Just two. Each one is going to have. How toast do you want to get four sets? That's a sum total of 16 sets of arms. So, but in rapid succession, the actual workout itself, but for the fact that we're going to be blabbered about technique, is going to take cheese probably like 15 minutes. And if you have 20 or 30 minutes to spare about two to three times a week, you can do something like this workout. We'll talk about how you can exchange exercises. Talk about it right now. You can do any kind of bicep and tries to exercise this. And this way, you can smash arms, get out quick, get to the little cafe down the street with that one girl. Kind of looked at you that one time. You flashed them, shit said it was just looked at. You're the girl on the guy flashed. I did the big arm. Our people are in workout now. I'm like, you see that shit? No shit's button. Pop an after that. One. Two. Three. Arms. All right, folks. First exercise combo is cable curls. And again, no particular attachment to that bar. Yep, there's a little double arm time to there. Whatever bars comfy, I can't use this bar because I don't have the mobility any more Jared can. So this is going to be the first exercise. Pretty close to zero rest Jared's going to walk over after doing about G.W. Wis.20 reps there. He's going to go to cable push downs and do something like 20 reps there. Wait about 30 seconds. And then hit this again. 18. Slow on the descent. 19. Fuck. Slow. A pop-up. Super slow. As if another. Rack. Excellent. Excellent. Push downs. You're going to be interested in having your elbows move back. For that stretch as you come up. As soon as it's your viceps, you can stop here. You can continue here a little bit more long. Hent activation, but that's not so necessary. Give them deal with choice. And of course, a smooth push down all the way. If you have to press it a little more, if you can do the arc, it's all right answers. And you know what else is good? Be shutting up. Pop. And just letting Jared be beautiful. 11. Keep going. Two more. Lucky number 13. Let's go. Drop. My man. Go. Slow. Shit. Shit. Yeah. Now guys, calling an audible here, you want to stay in that 10 to 30 rep range. Jared, you want me to lower the weight a little bit for next time. We're going to take like a 10 to 20% reduction. Jared was at 120 for this. We're going to take him down to 90. We want 15 to 20 reps on the next one to keep that rep range where we want it. You're just going about one zero to two reps in reserve. And I've, you know, kind of out. I'll talk to myself. I think it's about 30 seconds. Jared hit it again. Tack me twice on this. You're of course doing all good technique. Not in this crazy bullshit. No swinging. But you're looking to take your pinkies and shove them up into the sky as you move up. And you're looking to do the same thing with the insides of your elbows. You want to show the insides of your elbows to God. Slow. Is that 10? You're going to rest a bit. Rest a bit. Don't go anywhere. Curve ball. We said 15. We're going to my Ruffo way too. That shit. And you can totally do this in this workout. So you got short time. You got to hit it hard. Four more Jared. Let's go baby. Three. Hell yeah. Big moves. Yes. Slow. Block yeah. Right into it. 12. I'm post-contest. These are good times to do. These types of short workouts are when you're having a ton of intensity techniques inside of your training. In vacation periods post-contest periods. Time's when you're limiting the load. If I see you're on a cruise, you have like 50 pound dumbbells as a high sick goes. These are times when you can really do antagonistic techniques. You're going to take two percent. Push. And. Rest a bit. Finish the two. Slow. Full lock out. Yes. Slow. Shit. Awesome. One more of these left. I'm going to sheep. You don't look at a sheep. Is this a belt workout? My lungs are fucked. Seven. Slow. Block yeah. Eight. Slow. Alright. Let's go Jared. Move. Yes. Slow. Slow. Slow. Oh. Right into it. Oh. Cool. Six. Racket rest. Four left. Take about five seconds here. Two. Three. Go. Slow. Yes. Go. Man. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Four. Take a break. Oh yeah. Yeah. My lungs get you. Alright. Jared's going to take a break. And then we have the next exercises. Let me demo them for you. So you see what's in store. First exercise in this second series is going to be a dumbbell skull crusher. Notice we did bicep curls as the first exercise in the first series. And that's because we want to make sure bicep's get the due diligence and thus the try set quality was much lower here for the push downs because you're so tired after bicep's every time. This time we flip the script to give due diligence to try set and make sure this work out evenly hits everything. Or roughly evenly. Another four sets here of both. And that's it. Hit it. Beautiful. Two. Last point here. Take a pause. One whole second. Up. Yes. Good stop. Good stop. Good stop. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Right into my sense. Lightweight here, Jared. 10 to 15. And then rest a little bit. Four on your gun. Go. Yep. Last one. Go. Go. Slow. Fuck yeah. IFBB Pro. Jared Feather got more than he bargained for. And the same he artwork out. One more. Slow. Pause. Push. Wait. Yeah. That's good stuff, Jared. Huh. That's stuff whenever you're ready another four. Yes. One. Two. Wait a minute. That he's such a cool. He's shit. One more Jared. Try. Got damage. Slow. Control. Pause. Push. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Three. And then you're done. Far too. Yeah. Well, you got a good form. I'm from all this. One. Two. Last one. Big push. Yeah. Rack. In this respect you're my weights. Forms get pumped after not you or else after not your form will just be like, I love that shit. I can't do this. Let's sweep. Get the eight. Two more. Go. Slow. Great. Relax. Four. One. Two. Three. Go. Four. Hell yeah. Oh shit yeah. Two more in your done. Last one. Victory Jared. Let's go. Ah. Slow. Beautiful. Great. Great. Little break. And then try steps. Good stuff. Yep. Yes. To the girls. Seven. Fuck yeah. Nine. Good stuff. One set of five and that's it. Good. Two more. One more. Fuck. God damn it. I just let this be going. It's too much good footage. Tell the camera what you feel. And why? Oh. Disanyments. Burn. Condolacty. Motabolis. My forearm for my biceps. My triceps. My front-dulse a little bit from that last bit. Do you have a pump? Oh my god. Pump out of this world. Post contest stuff. Or on a cruise after you get a shitload on the buffet. This is the type of pumps that you get. Especially when you're doing intensity techniques. So this is good. Can't bend my arm all the way down. No way. Yeah. Can't hit. I can't do like a front-dulge right now. Try. Looks really cool. That almost veins weird. Again, I'm a fan of agonistic superstets. But that was fun. I actually don't do antagonistic superstets ever. So I'm sure there's some sort of novelty. That's imparted if you do something like that. You know? So maybe something to throw in. Every like other block of training. So. Or all the time if you want to save a shitload of time. Right. So. Got a pump. Yeah. Getting going out. Go ahead. Take a shirt off and dance around the cruise or whatever. Dance around the cruise folks. If you're on a cruise, go talk to people. Everyone there have a good time. If you want to do this workout, it'll only take 20 minutes out of your day. And then you're back to party. It'll put inches on your arm. That's one of the course of your. That's the most important part. Yeah. Inches on your arms. More important is inches on something else. That's not that's kind of channel for that kind of stuff. We'll see you next time. If we had a cruise. One week cruise. What's up funny. But it was going on in your home. As your home state of Missouri was the cruise theme. That's awful. Kind of activities can be expected on the ship. Cornhole. Okay. That sounds fun. Are anyone there? Baseball. Okay. Great. Kids activity. Build your own rickety. Death barn. Oh yeah. You said dad. I did see dad. Let's get to that work.
