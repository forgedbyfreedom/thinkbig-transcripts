Did you punch him by the f***er's face? It just had to explode at at you. I'm pretty sure if you get that much blood on you, somebody lost the match at that point. Holy shit. Hey folks, Dr. Mike here. I'm the creator of the RPH hypertrophy app, and I'm Professor of Exercise and Sport Science, and Lehman College in the Bronx in the Urex City. I'll spare the rest of where I'm from. Jake Paul is a person on the internet that I know almost nothing about. And Scott, if anything, I was like, hey, do you want to review this training? And I said yes. So that's fine, how are that goes? All right, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fight Night Circuit. I heard he was very good at fighting. This is curious. I do have a bit of an expertise in combat sport. I'm a Brown Belt Brazilian agency. I've competed a bunch. I've been paid to fight at least once, so technically that makes me pro, but only technically. I'm not that good at jujitsu, but I've been beat up a lot. And I've studied quite a bit about how to organize combat sport training, specifically weight training, a four sport position to be the best combat sport athlete possible. Let's see what I first find. Love his gloves. I can't even see his hands because it's so camouflaged. The goal of today's workout is to simulate the fight. We're going to have crowd noises playing. The air horns will be black. It is going to be loud as shit in here. And we have the craziest circuit. I can't tell if this is just for clicks. Or if they really think this is effective, I don't really have a problem with simulating the environment. I think the best time to simulate that would be when you're actually in the ring sparring, because that's the maximum sport specificity you're in the ring. You're sparring in training. And if you have crowd noises and air horns, like that's actually kind of smart to do. So I like that. If they're going to be doing some kind of weight training or a plyo circuit, the specificity is already so off that incrementally increasing the specificity by a small margin by doing crowd noises and air horns, it doesn't seem to fit all that well. But his coach looks like he knows things. So let's find out what he has to say. We're going to be tabernated to the full body. I'm saying I've tapped a few full bodies before. Road and bows, I'm saying. Just kidding. I've seen it on the television. And I was like, gee, whiz of people look like they're having a lot of fun with each other. I hope they're both wearing condoms. Is that how it works? You want me to hit upper body, lower body, feed agility. I like how you gave us a list of what has included in whole body. He's like, for those idiots, if you don't know what that means, there's an upper body and a lower body at least, I think. And there may be more parts of the body that I'm missing. We want some punches going to be. Some punches. I love that they're just getting in their like, wrappers in front of a camera style. Like, cutting each other off. Like, no, no, no, my man is trying to stay here. Is it again, agility, he's like, yes. And punches, yes. What else we got in all, babe? It's basically 30 minutes of health to simulate what the fight is going to be like. August 6 coming up as you guys know I'm taking a mass scene rock, man, junior. A seam, Rahman, junior. I don't know anything about boxing. I mean, literally almost nothing, especially from a fan perspective, if who's good. But if your name sounds like you're a black muslim, you're going to be beating my ass. That's the way I think about that shit. You don't want to ever beat a black muslim in a fight. That's nonsense. Scott, the video guy, can we look up if Jake Paul indeed won that fight or lost it? Can't so do the way this happens. Fight never happened. Rematch or no? Somebody didn't make way. That sucks to trade for that long and then. This is the fight. That circuit is going to be the case. Let's go. If he was my coach, you'd be like, hey, like, I like the air horn, but I don't like the air horn stuff fucking blow it into my face. So we're going to start off attacking the cold with some boxing, throw not some jams or come right here. Battle of Rome 30 seconds. Next station, verse of time with 30 seconds. We just have an oil line. Come right here. Can't hang please. By the time that you get through three high cardio demand exercises, the hand cleans are going to be so matte technical and so not conducive to training repeat power output that is curious to put them there. It's something that can work, but it's unlikely to work if the person maintains excellent technique and continues to provide a lot of hip drive through that movement. It can work. We'll see if it does in a second. 10 pull ups, fast as fast as you grab in the hammer. Part of all the way down. Tire flips. We're down there coming back the whole time. They're going to be throwing water in my face. You never know what's going to become an attribute in the fight. You never know what's going to become an attribute in a fight. I mean, I don't think the fight promoters lot to have a super-soaker that he shoots at people. You can be pretty sure in a fight that you don't get water in your face. Now the guy could sweat in your face. He could sweat in your own face. It's interesting. I would say this is like flashy bullshit for the sake of flashy bullshit. You can get your eye probe. You can get blood in your eye. I hope they like my last fight. Eye probe blood in your eye. Maybe you just go for full specificity and have that. I'm kidding. So hold on. They're going to be throwing water in my face. I'm going to tie our lips and come right in here and you guys are nice. Good squats. Squats after tire flips. I'd like to see that. Jesus. So the thing that goes BJ is going to bring them right here. Yeah, Coach BJ. No offense. All of you guys can beat my ass. BJ is a funny name. Do you guys know why? I don't know. Just feels nice to say. BJ. I've heard people have BJs. I don't know what that means, but I heard they're fun. Somebody loving you. Down there. I'll cut myself off. Okay. All right. I like it. A little body work. One minute body punch. I see him. Come on for your body. I see him. You a little bitch. You better make way. Ha ha. JK. One of us didn't. Scott, do we know who didn't make way? Yo, Ha'sime. Legit saw this video and he was a man. Fuck that. This guy's going to f*** me up. The way he's getting through this **** an obstacle course. I'm about that life. Mike, they re-guided 200. And he was 211 degree. And he was like 214. 214. 48 hours out. He didn't even try. My man. Making way. Dude, I'm not. I love the Ha'sime approach, man. That's that real life. Talk that shit. You sign a **** contract. And you just don't **** do dick. I love him. That's real shit talking. I made you prep for a fight pussy. And I didn't even show up ready for the show. I was that for **** Mike drop. Come off the body, punch his right here to some reverse ain't time push up. Nice. These are all by themselves quite good movements. The arrangement of so many of them in a row deludes the purpose of the training into a question mark. Knock those out. Hop on a ladder and roast me coming down. Got it back in a couple times. And I got it all. They were like, I every single exercise in the gym. You're going to do that shit. He's like, are you serious? Yep. Line him up. This is real real real shit. Let push him all the way down all the way back. So this would come back up those slid holes. Hop him right here on the first climb. You hold up versus a climber again. The salt like that, David. Oh, he got it wrong. It's the assault bike. I'll technically speak in a very similar move. We didn't name everything in the damn gym today. Cause that's how crazy going. He literally said, right? I just made a joke about. Yeah, folks. Prop or training doesn't mean doing everything. The proper training means figure out what you have to do. Your highest return on investment things are. And then organize them in a way like building blocks with them. Make the most sense to do. Like if you're taking a girl out to a restaurant to eat, which I don't know anything about. As I've never been out of the girl or to a restaurant or in public. But in any case, you know, you don't have to take the bitch to Italian, Chinese, you feel me American, Japanese food, and then back to French cuisine. You got to take her to a one nice place and usually seals the deal. Get that bitch a f***. A bucket of chicken from KFC. I said, you're in. Then you take her home and be like, would you think about that bucket of chicken? She's like, I love you. You know, like I know. Let me call my friend B.J. He's not picking up. Try to fit. Try to fit it. Time to imagine these things go. Correct me in the comments if I'm wrong about how dates work. If you guys like that, we have more of the extended cut in our member section. So give that a sign up and maybe you like things that happened there. Finish it up with some ads. Some reaction is some RFR. So yeah, they got a one round. We got three round. Very curious. That's a lot of stuff. I'm like God, dude. Yo, his training partners may like do this. Sox, everyone's f***ing yelling. The rumble sound, the air horn. This is what you're making. Dancehall, we're in a f*** box in jam. What the hell is going on here? He can't punch. He was f***ing ass up. I better be a sh** off the f***ing up talk on all this shit. You're just going to catch my ass. I'll be like, yeah, I heard you were a big funny man on YouTube making fun of my shit. I'm going to Mr. Jake Paul. If there is a chance for me not getting beat up by you, I'll do anything it takes. I heard you had a friend in B.J. I'm that friend now. Let me see you. I'm thorough and well studied. And eager. And technical. And I do with love. And a real interest in the fact that you have a good time. What? Secretly? I'm having a good time too. Let me up. We don't even have to be. That'll roast. Battle ropes is very good conditioning for boxing. And is a good movement by itself for this purpose. But in the context of everything else, it kind of loses some of its value. His training partners really look at that cell phone time. I know our numbers work, but I just don't want the shit to sneak up on me. I better say right away when it's time to switch. That occasion. First a climber. Okay, honestly bro, like, I don't mean to talk that shit. This is my job. So all fun and jokes. All fun and jokes. He's not really cranking on that thing. Like you don't do a circulate this to survive the shit. You do it to excel at it. You gotta push yourself. And I'm not saying he's not pushing himself. But I'm saying he might not be pushing himself. Look at that f*** arm speed. He's kind of coasting along. Like, you go faster. But maybe I just don't know when it's on purpose. The way I see this is a sport scientist is all this stuff. It's time not spent actually training boxing technique, boxing conditioning, boxing tactics, boxing strategy. You could do all the shit in the ring. And if you really want an extra crazy conditioning hit, just put on a f***ing weight vest. And then go in the f***ing ring. Now you're slow and heavy and you gas faster. And you still gotta throw those hands and keep that defense up. Move around because I shen yourself against a rotation of fresh guys. You just can't really beat training like that. Hey, clean time. Now, folks, the hand clean is an exercise that is a supposed to develop your ability to triple extend. Extending at your ankle, your knee, and your hip. It's the jumping motion with weight in your hands. And the proper way to do it is to hinge and do a double knee bend. So you dip your hips once the bar clears the knees, under the bar, and f*** it into the air. Literally, poof, you pop your hips up into the bar. That's the purpose of the hang clean. Doing the hang clean from multiple reps when you're already tired. If you can do that technique, works on maximizing your endurance. Ability to do what's called repeat power. High power output. One, two, three, four, five, six, et cetera. Number of times. It's a great exercise. This is a totally great way to use it. If you do not triple extend with it, it becomes kind of like a weird back and shoulder exercise that does just not a whole lot more than tired you out. So let's find out how we're doing it. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Hey, my head. Yeah, see plus. Pull ups. Hey, partial pull ups. You're most of the benefits of pull ups isn't that bottom half, bottom third. Big, last stretch. He's not doing that because he can't do as many pull ups as he'd after in order to be able to do that. I understand. So technique here is not great. Zero zero zero. Not terrible, but not great. All right. Hammer or tire. Yeah, okay. So I'll just cut to the chase. This is a great exercise to develop power in your anterior chain, which includes your hip flexor, your abdominals, and it basically allows you to curl your body powerfully. And it's a great exercise. And if in only if you do it with force intent to move has to be high, you're going to try to slam that hammer through that entire. He's just kind of surviving. Is this the best alternate use of his time? It preparing for a boxing match. Is there anything you could be doing with this 30 minutes and with the amount of fatigue that he is a lot of to this, which is a lot. Is there a better way to train for fighting? And the answer is it's either high power, high force lifting, a bit of basic conditioning work, and almost the rest of it needs to come from a variety of boxing drilling and sparring. Athletes, train in ways very similar to how they play their sport. The physical body is cool to have in great shape. But you got to remember that you're not there. The event isn't fucking hitting the ship with a hammer, and as there's no verse of climbers in the ring, there's just one dude into the face you don't like. You got to train much of your training as much as possible. Hitting people in the face were replicas of people, pads, shadow boxing, heavy bag, so on and so forth. Tire flips. Again, another. Oh, that's a lot of water. Did you punch him by the f**kest face? It just had exploded at you. I'm pretty sure if you get that much blood on you, somebody lost the match at that point. Holy shit. I mean, somebody is this point. Should shock him in the testicles. That's unexpected and it'll upset you. Yo, I love the spirit of the thing, but there's must be better ways to train for the sport of boxing. They don't get as many YouTube clicks. They sure win more fights. We are the back of the ship. I love the like low key hip hop in the background. Like, man, I'm just driving around to my Impala, getting water sprayed in my face. Time to do squats. I guess if I remember correctly, yep, 135 and the squat. The music still playing. Oh, God. Yeah, some half squat training at this point mostly. The glutes and lower back. It's just, this is just hard stuff. Things to make it hard. And I'd be on harder if he dunked it. It actually went full range of motion. For a boxer, that's not very important to do, but if you want bigger stronger, more powerful legs, doing so for engine motion squatting is probably ideal. It also burns legs out more, challenging him in the circuit more, but I don't want to get too critical in technique. Because you're just sort of beyond that to think. When the grand scheme is such a random disaster, the specifics are almost don't matter. What I'm trying to say is, there are intelligent contexts in which partial range of motion lifting is excellent for boxing. This is not what I'm feeling. There is no avoiding hard training if you want to grow. But if you want to grow the most, your training needs to be hard and smart. RP Hiperchography app will make sure you're progressing on track, monitoring, and adjusting your workout at all times. So for all that work you're doing, you can be sure you're getting the best results. Alright, work in the body. Now like, he's punching not so hard. This looks a lot like what my wife and I do every Saturday morning, but it's much more psychological for us. Alright, decline pushups. Okay, so like, I don't know what to say about this. Halfway down, zero, zero, zero. He could easily look forward and then touch his chest to the ground. It's just kind of bouncing around these are terrible pushups. Limited application to boxing. If you wanted a better transfer of training, you would have a closer grip and keep your elbows in a little bit, because that's how you throw punches. You typically don't punch from out here. So unless you're trying to hypertrophy the chest on purpose, which I don't know the any of this is really on purpose at this point. Yeah, we've done some, it looked into the ladder and it turns out that like, if you do the ladder drill off and you're testing who's already the most athletic and as the best footwork. And then you're letting those people just become better at the ladder as a skill in and of itself. It's not a terrible training modality. It's good for basic development like when you're training children to move athletically. But the best way to do footwork and boxing is to do boxing specific footwork, which this is not. Oh, that's right. Slide pushes. Yep. I don't really know how sled pushing transfers a ton to boxing. It's probably okay for repeat power development, but you got to move a little faster than that to get that effect. It's just kind of ways of making someone work more. As we'll get a job at Walmart stacking boxes at this point just stack these boxes really fast. Great. I'm in boxing shape. All right. We're on the bike. He's either insanely exhausted or he's not trying so hard. Maybe he's working on pacing himself, but again, pacing is such a thing. It's the thing you want to do in the boxing training specifically. That's where pacing helps you the most. In physical training like this, generally you don't want pacing, you want to go more or less all out so you can push your systems further. All right. Working on some ducking. It's cool. Again, a fine movement by itself. That's cool. I love the tennis ball stuff. So some hand reaction stuff. Again, this is a thing you would benefit from doing fresh and as a warm up for a technical boxing session. Now when you're doing it tired, I'm not so sure it makes you better at it. You just kind of suck at it because you're tired. Again, this is also allowing him to recover substantially, so it's not improving the quality of the conditioning work. Oh, we got some grappling work here. Looking for the underhook. That's cool. You're f***ing alone. Dope. Yeah. Again, these folks know how to train hard. The direction of the training should be at least a little bit more specific. Yeah, one at a time, this is a f***ing giant waste of time. I have no idea what that exercise is training. I've never seen anyone do a face pull to the top of their head. What the f*** is that? F***s. Folks, when you're training for sport, get you a sport scientist and a sport coach. Tape, organize your training in such a way that makes the most possible sense. So that when you're training for boxing, you do as much boxing as possible to get you the most technique, the most tactics. And you minimize the amount of training you do for basic cardio work, and you minimize the amount of training you do for strength and power work down to the very core essentials. But pay the biggest dividends so you can get better baseline of endurance with a little bit of running. You get a much better baseline of strength and power with a little bit of lifting weights in the gym, very simple movements. And you spend the vast majority of your time in the ring, working with pads, working with bags, working with a coach, do some shadow boxing. That's where you can drive both. Your tactical and tactical abilities and a whole shit little of your endurance exactly specifically in the sport of boxing. Or whatever sport is you're doing. Athletes should train mostly the sport that they're playing in very similar ways to how they play it. Derevidives and combination drills and tactical drills and actual sparring. And on top of that, they can do a little bit of strength power training, a little bit of baseline endurance training. I wouldn't like mixing all those together, spending too much time ironically coming from me a meathead. Bodybuilder, too much time in the gym, not enough time in the boxing ring. And if you want to become better boxing, getting in that ring is much as possible to the extent your body can allow it. Is a really really good idea. So I don't know. Seven out of ten, do we still rate these things? F***er, fine now. I've been Dr. Mike. See you next time. Alright folks, if you enjoyed that video, you two think that you liked this video right over here. And if you're click on it, then I become incrementally more wealthy. And I invite more Lamborghinis and my butlers, the 78 butlers that I have now, they're happy you're too. Thank you.
