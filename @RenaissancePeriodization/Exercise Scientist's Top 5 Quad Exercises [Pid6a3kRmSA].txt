You are a good person, but you have one fatal flaw. Your quads are small, but we're gonna fix it. Because I have five favorite quattaccharisis, I'm gonna share with you just like a venereal that what? Let's go do this. Folks, exercise number one. By the way, aren't in order of effects, they're all awesome. Exercise number one is the high bar squat. First of all, what the hell is the high bar squat? It is a deep squat. Done almost exactly like a Olympic weight lifters do the squat. The bar sits very high on your shoulders, really close to your neck. You're gonna pinch your shoulder blades back, keep your chest elevated the entire time. Your foot stance is really up to you. You're gonna push your feet out properly at about a 45 degree angle, plus or minus, however, as a comfy. You're gonna take a roughly shoulder width stance, though a little bit wider or narrower, based on preference totally fine. Staying completely upright, keeping the pressure on your toes and heels at the same time. You are gonna descend by letting your knees come way over your toes and out. Is this gonna hurt you? No, it's gonna give you enormous quads and strong resilient knees. How deep should you go? As long as your lower back isn't question mark rounded or you're not really far off on your toes and off of your heels, you want to go as deep as possible for two very good reasons. One is that the more you stretch the quads at a high tension, the more they grow. And two, the more mobility you can develop from this exercise, the less probability of injury you'll have in a bunch of daily tasks. And if you're into that sort of thing, it's gonna make you better at sports. But there's one 1,000% super huge thing. Most people won't tell you about the high bar squat, which is to me the biggest unlock. It's gonna put literal hair on your chest. Making your grown man unless you're female. And then it'll get you as the kids say, peached completely out of your mind. As you can probably tell, I was heavily bullied as a child. One of the mean words people called me was a scissy. Mike, you're a scissy they would say and I took them literally. So I began to get jacked quads by doing our next exercise that I love. These scissy squat. I'm sure there's a no-man-claidural reason. Why it's called that? The scissy squat is brutal especially if you do it with the appropriate machine. You can 100% do this just with some kind of device for you to hold on just at their ground. Absolutely. But with a machine you can get that extra super deep stretch. You're gonna say as upright as you possibly can, you're chest pointed to the sky. You're hips all the way through. You're gonna go down really slowly as the pad rotates for you. And you're gonna get your knees forward and down is deep as possible under control. Then you're gonna spend one or two seconds at the bottom every single time milking that deep stretch at the highest point of tension. And then coming all the way back up, you should do this, stabilize on a power rack or Smith machine or something else you could hold on to. Like maybe the hand? Of a good friend. Guys this exercise might look easy but it is actually incredibly tough. It is what the leg extension, according to Scott the video guy, was supposed to be. Maximum tension at the deep stretch. Minimum tension at the top, matching the forescarf that you want for the ultimate high hypertrophy. So next time people call you as Sissy, you say, well six, six and stones can break my bones but I can always turn out to be an adult and plot to kill you whenever the f*** never forgot middle school mother f***ers. If you try this exercise and it's it can possibly difficult, don't you worry. A lot of this is just neural learning. There's a technique to it. Every rep every set is gonna be easier. If you get to be a really strong king or queen, you can always put on a belt just like for dips or pull-ups, put weight on that mug and hit it. And the last recommendation I have is don't come all the way up, walk out, to get that rest. Keep them in tablomites, frying you by coming up only two thirds of the way and coming right back down, slow on the way down, big pause, controlled on the way up. This is money, times whatever rich people, big lot of money. Yeah that's what it is. Just like with my many butlers, I don't play favorites. So exercise number three isn't my third favorite, but it's absolutely in that tied for first. The hacksquat. The hacksquat requires of course hacksquat, she. But it is a very, very awesome exercise, especially if done right. Many of these exercises are done better for higher repetitions. High bar squats can be done for sets of five to ten very, pretty actively and so can hacksquats, but they're adaptable because they can also be done for high reps. The thing with the hacksquat that you want to make sure to get the best is you want to bring your heels as far back down on the platform to your butt as you can. Until they're almost starting to lift the bottom. That way you can still get tons of pressure off your heels, generate a ton of force, recruit the biggest fast-witch motor units in your quads and that's the most muscle, but at the same time, get the biggest bend in your knee and thus put the most stretch under load onto the quads. This is going to be a downside though because you can no longer put 18 plates per side, but really strong hacksquat, but a huge quads is going to use three, four, maybe five plates per side. If you can do six plates per side for sets and reps, you might be a humongous, humongous quad in individual, somebody like Joe Sullivan, who is an all-time world record squat holder and really only needs six and change plates for his quads. So the hacksquat is awesome, take your time on the descent, spend about a second or two in the hole, you can come all the way up to breathe, especially if you like doing my reps, or you can come up only two thirds the way and then back. I would say it's not a big deal, but maybe have someone hang around or two people hang around your hacksquat on the really tough sets, so they can drag your dumbass out of the machine when you're not only throttle, fail, and almost die. To make your hacksquat a more fun and actually more effective, there are two pieces of equipment you might be interested in. One is the weight lifting belt. Any kind of belt will do, I prefer to get my belts off from the pioneer belt company, is there great? And you put that belt on nice and tight, not so tight that you can't breathe the ton, but it'll really, really firm up your waist, generate a ton of intrametal pressure and let you feel stronger during that movement. Weight lifting shoes also help a lot. They have a heel, they're very sturdy, and they can let you really push that heel and really get your quads going. I forgot that weight lifting shoes were a huge asset on this, and then Scott the video guy reminded me, so I yelled at him, you do your job, I'll do mine, and I stole his idea, gave him zero credit. Sounds like he didn't even credit, but I'm not because it's credit for nothing. Do you understand me, Scott? Exercise number four is going to be the leg press. Well, I press isn't awesome quad at your size, but most leg presses just aren't that good. We do have an opposition for the demonstration purposes. It was video, the arsenal leg press, which is goded, yes that does mean, is ethically sourced, made entirely of goats. You don't happen to have one of these, you can use some modifiers which we will show in this video. Big modifier is wearing weight lifting shoes. They give you a heel and a lot of it go nice and deep. Most leg presses around your back before that happens. The other modifier you might want to use is put some padding. Could be a foam mat, could be a roller, could be something underneath your lower back as low on that pad as it goes. That means you're going to be able to lean back further. You're going to open up more range of motion at your knees and you're going to be able to go deeper. As long as you have your feet as low on a platform as possible, such that your heels are still touching, you're good to go. And in the leg press, you could do the mirror, you could do the medium, you could do them wide. When you do the wider, just make sure to point your toes out even further. That's going to hit your addoctors a ton and still hit your quads like crazy. One of the tips I have for the leg press especially if you're a mobile of flexible king or queen is to try to have your tummy out, your chest up, and try to get your knees to get outside of your chest and tummy to hypothetically, theoretically, potentially aim to touch your shoulders. What? How's that possible? I'm not sure. But if you manage to do it, you're going to have enormous quads. All right, folks. Our last exercise for today in my top five most favorite currently at this time in my life, quad exercise is the belt squat. You need a belt squat to the belt squat. Now, you can rig a belt squat by putting a dip belt on and put some platforms up and doing some stuff like that. Good luck. The belt squat is an excellent excellent tool. What you want to do is make sure that if the belt squat doesn't feel super hard at the bottom and easy at the top, you want to put some mats underneath your feet if you have access to them to get that lever point up. So the very bottom is where that squat is going to be the hardest. We're going to plug your belt in. You don't need a ton of weight for this and you want to come up every time to about two thirds of the way and come back down that keeps the tension on the quads, racks up the metabolites in your legs and it really cooks the little block out of you in the best way possible, of course. The other thing with this is you can take advantage of the fact that because the belt is on your hips and it doesn't compress your spine, it doesn't fatigue you a ton just to lock out with the weight and weight a little while. And because it's annoying to plug yourself in and out of the machine all the time, you can capitalize by doing either my reps or my rep match. So here's how I would do the exercise. Put on a weight that you can do for about 15 to 20 reps. Do a straight set of that weight, two thirds to the weight of lock out every single time. Rack, let's say it's 18 reps right at down in your notebook, put it into your RPI-perture-fiat. The RP-hyperture-fiat removes all uncertainty and makes the training process precisely defined. Choose your pre-made workout plan from dozens available in the app, plug in your weights and the app takes care of the rest for months of productive training. Ready? Click on the link in the description of this video to get started. The next set and the set after that, you're going to hit 18 both times, which you won't be able to on a straight set because it'll be too tired. As soon as you hit, let's say 14 on that second set, you're going to lock out completely and you're going to rest five to ten seconds. As soon as you're about ready to go again, you're going to hit it again and finish the other four repetitions that you didn't have. This is going to just pump a crap load of fluid into your legs. It is going to destroy in the best way possible. And we're going to take Max the editor boy, make him suffer through real my rep set just for your viewing pleasure. Isn't it nice that you get to pay nothing and watch other people suffer on YouTube? Thanks YouTube. One more and then lock out. Rest. Breathe, no pressure, Max. Nice and easy. What you can do if you're really pressed for time in the situation is you can actually just do one set and have an amazing quad workout, especially if you train quadzic twice a week. I know it sounds crazy but one set of quadz actually can work. You may be in the machine for like five minutes but hey five minutes and your quadzard on? Man, what a huge, huge benefit time wise. So what we're going to do is we're going to plug Max in. He's just going to be a 45 on each side. He's going to do a ton of reps almost as many as he can. Two thirds lock out so I won't be that many. He's going to rest a little bit and he's going to go rest go, rest go. We are going to rack up the reps until Max is just not interested being alive anymore but then he'll be really interested in being alive because he's going to have enormous of being juicy hot dog overcooked quads. Move. Up. Well, you're good you're good to stay there. Let it burn. Let it burn. It's part of the process. Part of the process. Go. Rest of going anywhere. Good stuff, Max. Good stuff, Max. Two control slow slow. Weight up. Again slow slow. Weight up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Up. Rest free. Very good. Nice and easy. Got unloaded. This is grandma shit down. Down, slow, ha, good stop. Up. Down, ultra slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, wait. Up, go max, go, come on. Rest, breathe, don't go anywhere. Good stuff, you can move your feet around a little bit, wiggle and round a little bit, go. Up, up. Up. Rest, don't go anywhere. Back into the position, back into the position. One, go. Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, wait. Rest, breathe, eight second eccentric, slow. Slow, slow, slow, slower. Up, wait, wait, wait. Up, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. That's it, you're done. That is full muscular failure. Free yourself. Good stuff, man. That's like, you know, 30 reps or some shit. Max, what do you say, a few more sets? No. We got it. Got it, no. Try to jump as high as you can. It's like basketball camp all over again. It was so good. Two things. Get you some surfer boy here, like max the editor boy, and get you some big ass quads like max the editor boy. If you want to save time, you got to realize you're going to take the debit card to pain. You're going to pay it off somehow. Remember that one movie with Justin Timberlake and that one finance bitch, really the currency was time instead of money. Well, that movie was awful and had terrible morality, but that one girl get it. That's all I got, max the editor boy, the man, Scott's a better guy, the man. You guys are also, quote really, the man, and we'll see you next time. I'm W. Oh, my way to you. Good at what I do. Oh, and W.
