Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's on the power so the question of the day is, is body building dying? So I've seen this question over and over again and I've seen this comment over and over again that body building is a dying industry body building as a sport as a pageant whatever you want to call it is dying There's even some body building YouTubers that are now switching away from making body building videos because they also claim that body building is dying So the question is body building dying is kind of a loaded question so to answer this question is body building in terms of general interest in the sport is interest in body building starting to die and the answer to that question is absolutely not Interested body building I think has actually never been higher than it is right now is the quality of the competitor starting to die. I think the answer to that question might be yes I think social media has brought more attention and more interest to body building than ever before in the history of the sport I think body building right now is really at an all-time high of interest. Do you have body builders like fill Heath, J. Cutler and Kai Green with millions? Millions of followers on social media So I say that body building is that it's all time most popular state because someone like Kai Green can have millions of followers without even having one the biggest body building show Ever the Mr. Olympia back in the 70s amongst body building fans body building was very popular Arnold Schwarzenegger was a hero the body building fans But I wouldn't say back in the 70s Lou Ferigno Arnold Schwarzenegger Serge new brai Frank Zane. I wouldn't say these guys were known by millions of people I wouldn't say these guys were followed by millions of people. I would say within the kind of cult like body building community They were very heavily followed but it wasn't a worldwide phenomenon like it is today even back when I started working out when I was like 14 or 15 going to the gym back in 2008 2009 This was prior to Instagram prior to you know Twitter prior to most social media before YouTube really took off There wasn't a whole lot of body building content out there really the only thing out there was my space a couple top body builders like Jay Cutler I think he had a mice base back in the day and I followed him on my space but back then there wasn't a whole lot of interest in going to the gym amongst teenagers and kids because there wasn't an Instagram I think Instagram right now and these body builders being on Instagram is a big reason for why going to the gym taking supplements following body building is so popular because they see it on Instagram But back in like 2007 2008 2009 when I first started working out and there was none of that I was like the only person my age going to the gym. I was like the only 15 16 year old at the gym because no one was interested in that There was only like a couple kids that were wanting to go to the gym and now all I see You know the majority of my followers on YouTube high school kids college kids Lot of young guys it's a whole movement now of going to the gym and following body building So again to answer the question is interest in the sport dying are there gonna be less fans in the future? Absolutely not I think the interest is just growing and continually growing. I think the fan base is also growing and continually growing and body building Through that is gonna get bigger there's gonna be more people buying supplements more people buying tickets more people going to expose like the Arnold classic The Mr. Olympia because they're seeing it on Instagram on social media all the people that they idolize are aspire to be whether reoffitness model a body builder men's physique guy They see these guys are gonna be at the expose So they go to the expo and maybe they see something at the expo that gets them interested in body building in general And because of that I just think body building is gonna continue to grow and just look at the numbers on a YouTube channel like mine All my channel is is commentary on body building and the history of body building And I have 200 million views on my channel 400 thousand subscribers on my channel and this is just commentary on body building So for people to say body building is dying There's a lack of interest in body building people are starting to leave the sport as fans I think there's absolutely zero truth to that whatsoever However, if you look at the other standpoint of the question is body building dying And you look at the caliber of the competitor the level of competition the types of people that are winning pro shows The types of physique that are being rewarded at pro shows Then the question is a little bit different the answer to that question could absolutely be yes because at these shows They're seeing guys place very highly with very very poor conditioning You're seeing guys being rewarded for coming in big and full and around But they also have a massive stomach and a massive gut to go with that fullness and roundness But it seems that the judges are looking for okay, you're big and full and round It doesn't matter if the midsection isn't there So I think in that regard the answer to the question is yes that attitude towards body building the bigger is better We want the most muscular guy Get his biggest possible and we're going to reward you coming full coming freaky coming massive that attitude I think is killing the sport of body building 100% And not just from a theoretical standpoint literally killing the sport of body building I mean look what happened Dallas Macarver Dallas Macarver's a young kid Obviously the sport of body building to him was about getting as big as possible I believe at one point he weighed 350 pounds in the off season If not even more than that his goal was clearly just to get massive to get big And the judges were rewarding him as shows second place at the Arnold Classic top 10 at the Mr. Olympia So clearly they were looking for a look like that And because of that Dallas kept pushing himself and he ended up dead the sport of body building Not only dying but literally killing the people participating in it However, there does seem to be an antidote to this problem and that antidote seems to be classic physique Classic physique was the answer of the IAPB to this problem specifically They wanted to draw more mainstream interest into the sport They wanted to present a healthier kind of safer, more downsized physique That was kind of a reminiscent of the 70s the golden Arab body building classic physique What some hardcore body building fans consider to be a real body building They don't really want the mass monster they don't really want the freak There's a lot of hardcore body building fans that want the aesthetic physique the old school physique Kind of a respectable well-posed well presented physique And classic physique was the answer to that problem So it's not like there was this issue of big guts, bad conditioning and mass monsters And no one was doing anything about it that wasn't the case it was actually a case of the IAPB in my opinion Actually did a really good job of recognizing this a lot of people were complaining about it a lot of people were complaining and criticizing About the bubble guts about the size and condition of these guys and saying hey, you know, this is not body building This is not what we want to see and the IAPB clearly saw those comments They clearly saw that attitude in that opinion and that was why they answered with classic physique So the question is body building dying I think the term body building in that question refers to all categories classic physique men's physique body building Two 12 body building men's open body building any of these divisions where someone is competing and showing their physique they build up over the years These are all body building these are all people who built their physique and they're competing with their physique So as a whole the industry the sport the page on whatever you call it body building is certainly not dying I think it's kind of at a stagnant point right now as far as men's open body buildings concerned and the quality of competitor seems to be going down a little bit But I think that's all going to change. I think classic physique is going to help things and I think body building as a whole right now It's only going to get bigger. There's nowhere to go but up in my opinion I think with social media YouTube Instagram Facebook whatever the next big social media side is body building is only going to continue to grow As more and more pro shows start to live stream more coverage and I'm trying to facilitate a lot of that and cover a lot of pro shows that don't live stream There shows like the indie pro Toronto pro smaller shows like that where you can't go and watch it online So I try to give you guys up to date coverage on those shows If you can't go to them or watch them live But I think as technology evolves as more of these people have the ability to live stream their shows It's going to generate a lot more interest in body building if we can watch every single pro show online So let me know what your guys' answer to the question would be in the comment section below Is body building dying yes or no?
