Alright, what's going on you guys Nick here with Nick's time to power so I know there's been a lot of hype this week and about the Chicago bro But I don't want you guys to forget there was also the van cover pro this weekend, which was also an Olympia qualifier So that's why all these shows are important because the winner of all these shows We're gonna see at the Mr. Olympia so we cover these shows because they tell us who's gonna be on the Olympia stage So the lineup at the van cover pro wasn't nearly as deep as the lineup at the Chicago pro There weren't a whole lot of big names there. They weren't a whole lot of impressive guys there So I'll give you guys the top six here first so in the first place spot you have a guy named Lucas Oslo do so Lucas Oslo do is a guy That does not have the prettiest physique. He's very blocky in my opinion. He has a very blocky waist And he has some kind of weird body parts and weird proportion But that being said this guy is very very consistent and the reason why he places high and win shows is Conditioning is consistently just excellent excellent conditioning on this guy So I think the main two reasons he won this shows number one again the lineup really wasn't that deep And number two he was easily the best condition guy on that stage I'll be it not a very pretty physique, but conditioning does one shows and this is proof positive of that statement So in second place you have Alexis Rivera and third place you have Josh Wade and fourth place You have Ian Viere who in my opinion. I mean this guy is my favorite physique out of this lineup So the first time I saw this guy on stage and really noticed him was at the indie pro I was probably about three rows back from the front row of the stage and when this guy came out He was one of the guys that impressed me right off the bat. I mean this guy has one of the most massive and impressive most Muscular from the front that I think I've ever seen. I mean this guy's shoulders He's got like bowling ball sized delts. This guy has a crazy amount of mass and honestly for as much muscle as he carries on his frame His waist really isn't that big he actually has a very tapered waist For a guy that packed on as much muscle as he has onto that frame So I think Ian is very impressive. I would have liked to see him higher than fourth I think he could have been pushing you know a Josh Wade or an Alexis Rivera You know Lucas Oslo do again not the prettiest physique, but he was more conditioned than pretty much anybody else in that top six So behind Ian you had Victor Conno in sixth and Ronaldo Gary in that fifth place spot So let's get back to Lucas Oslo do for a minute So I was talking to Johnny Styles who was at the Vancouver pro in person And he told me that the conditioning on Lucas is something you really have to see in person Because for me it doesn't really come across as well in the photos as I'm sure it did on stage in person He obviously does look conditioned in the photos, but to me there's nothing crazy or stand out about the conditioning just looking at these pictures Now while I'm not a very big fan of the structure of his physique or the look of his physique one of the things that I do Appreciate about him is the fact that he does these crazy posing routines He always does something very unique and very memorable He always makes an effort to emphasize his posing. I mean he always does some crazy flexible stuff on stage You know touches his toes and he does this weird thing I remember at the Arnold Classic I was in the audience for that as well During his posing routine at the Arnold in Columbus, Ohio He did this weird thing with his glutes where he would like roll the glute like the sin you of the glute The fibers of the glute he would start from the bottom and flex the fibers from the bottom to the top Like it was something I've never seen before was one of the most you know odd things I've ever seen in opposing routine But it was memorable. I think that's one of the reasons why this guy does stand out on stage And again with this not being really the deepest line up I pretty much knew that he was gonna win after the pre-judging video I even said in my pre-judging video from Vancouver On the base on the way they constantly had Lucas in the middle and they were moving other guys around to compare to Lucas It looked like he was gonna be the clear winner of that show and that turned out to be the case So for those of you that can't tell or don't know who these guys are Lucas is the guy in the green posing trunks on the left hand side of him that is Josh Wade on the right hand side of him That is Alexis Rivera on the far right and the light blue posing trunks. That is Ian Viere and on the far left That would be Ronaldo Gary the personally out of this lineup my favorite physique at all these guys Ian Viere I guess the conditioning is what held him back because honestly I think from a physique stand point from a structure stand point From a just sheer muscle mass with a small waist in a weak lineup I mean this guy was one of my favorite physique so Ian Viere to me was a stand out of this show Lucas also don't get to see a limpia qualification and the win So that's the recap of the van cover pro please give this video a thumbs up if you've been enjoying the body building coverage Thanks for watching this video next time for power signing out
