Today, love found strength to open my eyes I'll be right, so open my eyes I'll be right, I'll be right, I'll be right Could take my eye Now I'm sinking under drowning faster Please just let me breathe like me I'll see if I can relax in need of you again You'll cry, we'll die, we'll make this surrender We'll rise from your end to your end
