Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's Time of Power. So I want to make a video today about the 1976 Mr. Olympia contest. Now you might be asking yourselves, what is the significance of the 1976 Mr. Olympia? Well, in the early 1970s, Arnold Schwarzenegger dominated the Olympia scene and was the most dominant Mr. Olympia in Olympia history at that point in time when he was first six Olympia titles from 1975 ending with the 1975 Mr. Olympia. Obviously the filming of Pumping Iron took place. Documenting the journey of Arnold Schwarzenegger Lou Fergnot and of course Serge New Bray to that 1975 Olympia stage. And of course as we all know in 1975, a lot of people thought that marked the end of an era because Arnold officially announced his retirement during the 1975 Mr. Olympia after he won that title. Now as we all know he would come back in 1980, but the following year in 1976 would be the first Mr. Olympia without Arnold Schwarzenegger. And that made things very, very interesting. Now before we dive into the 1976 Mr. Olympia, I want to rewind a little bit to the 1974 Mr. Olympia. Now the reason I want to do that is because in 1974, that was the first Mr. Olympia competition ever to have two different weight classes. The over 200 and of course the under 200. Now that fact is important because in 1976 you'd have the first winner of a Mr. Olympia that won the under 200 and then went on to win the overall the overall Olympia title by defeating a heavyweight or an over 200 pound body builder. So in 1976 not only was Arnold no longer in the over 200 division, but Lou Fergnot and Serge New Bray, who had previously been dominant members of the over 200, both of them were not in it as well. So all of the competitors in the over 200 division were brand new competitors to the Mr. Olympia and Ken Waller who won and Mike Katz who took second. Now you may remember both of those names from Pumping Iron. Now their journey was documented but was not their journey to the Mr. Olympia. It was their journey to a amateur show. In 1976 would be both of their first Olympias then in the under 200 pound category had Franco Colombo, Frank Zane, Ed Corny, Bill Grant and Boyer Coe, Bill Grant and Boyer Coe also competing in their first Mr. Olympia ever. So 1976 marked the end of an era and marked the end of the era of Arnold Schwarzenegger and it marked the beginning of an era of new body building champions. Particularly it marked the beginning of the under 200 body builder era. So from 1976 to 1979 the winner of the Mr. Olympia competition would be all under 200 pound body builder. So in 1976 of course you had Franco Colombo winning his first of two Mr. Olympias. So that was significant that Franco won his first title. But the following year 1977, 1978 and 1979 you had Frank Zane win his three Mr. Olympia titles. Frank Zane also an under 200 pound body builder. So the interesting thing here is that Arnold Schwarzenegger would come back in 1980 to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia and at the 1980 Mr. Olympia there were no weight classes. There was no over 200 there was no under 200. So the end of Arnold Schwarzenegger's body building career marked the beginning of the under 200 champion and then Arnold Schwarzenegger coming back in 1980 marked the end of the under 200 champions. I don't know what significance there is to that and if Arnold had anything to do with that that just happens to be the case. So that is the story of the significance of the 1976 Mr. Olympia. I've got a couple other very popular videos about some of the older Mr. Olympias as well and I'm planning on doing some more in the future. So stay tuned for those. Thank you guys for watching the video. I hope you enjoyed it. Please give this video a thumbs up if you did enjoy it. Next time of power signing out.
