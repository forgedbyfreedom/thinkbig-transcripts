Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick time to power. So I came across a fascinating discovery here on Instagram. Now I believe this guy could be the next Mr. Olympia. So what are the two things in bodybuilding that people always say need to be improved? Number one would be smaller waste. Number two, a longer neck. So I stumbled across this young bodybuilding prodigy on Instagram that goes by the name of Daddy Longneck. And I've got to say I'll be damned if this kid doesn't have the longest neck that I've ever seen and these smallest waste that I've ever seen. Now not only does Daddy Longneck have the physique of a Greek god combined with a snapping turtle, but he's also developed a revolutionary new way of tanning for a bodybuilding show by covering his entire body and peanut butter. Now if peanut butter isn't going to make your physique stand out on stage under those bright lights, I don't know what is. Now in addition to having the longest neck in the bodybuilding game and an incredible smooth and nutty tan. Daddy Longneck has a posing routine that would rival Kai Green's greatest routine. Now what is the other element of bodybuilding that we've been saying is lacking lately? Conditioning. I mean this guy, Daddy Longneck, is shredded to the absolute bone. You can literally see his rib cage. But other Mr. Olympia competitor has a rib cage sticking out on stage the extent of Daddy Longneck. He is the embodiment of shredded to the bone. And don't even get me started on the incredible bicep development on Daddy Longneck. Forget about the 24 inch pythons on Hulk Hogan. Look at these 9 inch garrters and eggs right here. Another small now, but they have potential. So you heard it here first guys. This is the next bodybuilding prodigy that's up and coming. Most likely he's going to break the Olympia record. Put some respect on the neck.
