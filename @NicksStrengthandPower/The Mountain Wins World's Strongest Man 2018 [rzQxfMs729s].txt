Alright, what's going on you guys, Nick here with Nick's time to power. So a little bit of road strongest man coverage here. So I'm excited to report that half-thdoor Bjornsson aka the mountain has finally won the world strongest man competition at the age of 29 years old. Now he actually had a pretty good lead in winning this. He had 51.5 points to take the win, coming in second place was Matt to use Kielis Kowski with 45 points. So he beat him by 6.5 points, then Brian Shaw the former four-time world strongest man came in third place, where they total of 44 points. So very excited to see half-thdoor finally be successful in winning that world strongest man. I've been saying for a long time, I think it's just a matter of time. It's not a question of if it's a matter of when he wins it. Is this guy, I mean, he isn't saying Lee Talton. Standing at a massive height of 6 foot 9 inches tall, weighing roughly 400 pounds, half-thdoor has been competing in the world strongest man every single year since 2011. The first year he ever competed, he was in the top 6 placing sixth. And then going back to last year at the 2017 World strongest man, a lot of people kind of saw this coming. Because half-thdoor took second last year to the new champion Eddie Hall. Obviously after that Eddie retired, he did not compete this year. So a lot of people saw a 2018 as either being the time that Brian Shaw makes his comeback and takes another title, or the reign of a new champion, Half-thdoor Bjornson. And I'm really excited for him. I think now this makes him the biggest star in the history of strong man, having the role that he had in Game of Thrones. And some of the roles that he's had in Hollywood making his name even bigger. And being known as the mountain. Now he actually has that world strongest man title under his belt. So I'm extremely happy for him. Please give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it. Half-thdoor Julius Bjornson is the new World strongest man, 2018.
