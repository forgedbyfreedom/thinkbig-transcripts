Alright guys, so here you have the guest posing video from the Pittsburgh Pro. So essentially what the Pittsburgh Pro is, it's kind of like a preview of the Mr. Olympia. It's held about six months before. And basically all the top guys from the Olympia are going to come out. They're going to pose in off-season condition. So it's basically like the yearly preview. You've got big ramy, rolly-winkler, fil Heath, William Bonac, Sean Road, Nathan Gash, a Dexter Jackson, and of course your classic physique, Mr. Olympia, champ, Brianna Andzley. Now obviously again this is off-season condition. So obviously some guys are going to look better than others because a lot of these guys are only competing in the Olympia. I think Gash is doing New York Pro, which is in a couple of weeks now. So some of these guys are obviously going to look better than others. But most of these guys are deep in the off-season, simply prepping for the Olympia. In my opinion, I think everybody looks pretty good. I think Bonac looks phenomenal. He's in phenomenal shape. I'm granted he just competed only a couple months ago now, Dexter as well. But for the most part I think this is one of the coolest events of the year man. Seeing all these guys on stage, guest posing. So enjoy the video. Please give it a thumbs up. Nick's strength and power. Signing out.
