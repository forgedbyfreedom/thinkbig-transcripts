Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's on the power. So this video is going to be specifically about the 1993 Mr. Olympia competition, which was won by Dorian Yates. But specifically the part that I wanted to touch on here was Lou Fragno's comeback The year prior in 1992 and he would continue competing until 1994. So he had a comeback that span really three years But specifically his appearance at the 1993 Mr. Olympia was one of the more interesting of his appearances Because that would be the show where he would be compared with Flavio Bashi and Nini And Flavio Bashi and Nini was a good friend of his, but he also happened to be significantly shorter than him. In fact Flavio was the shortest bodybuilder on record To ever make it to and compete in the Mr. Olympia competition standing out of height of only four foot 11 So not even five foot tall. I mean, weighing approximately 145 pounds on stage during that time at the Mr. Olympia So of course some of the photos that come out of 1993 of Lou Fragno on stage next to Flavio Or some of the most interesting looking bodybuilding photos of all time because you see two guys Well they massive size difference Lou Fragno being roughly six foot four or six foot five And at his biggest point during his comeback his weight was somewhere over 300 pounds on stage according to multiple different sources So you got a guy that weighed literally twice as much as Flavio Bashi and Nini Literally more than twice as much as Flavio Bashi and Nini who weighed 145 pounds Lou Fragno weighing an excess of 300 And you know roughly two feet taller than Flavio Bashi and Nini so very cool photos from the 1993 Mr. Olympia of Lou and Flavio Kind of playfully being compared next to each other But to make things even more interesting in 1993 Lou Fragno placed tenth And Flavio placed only three places behind Lou at 13th so the comparison wasn't a comparison made Just for the hell of it and just because it would be a fun comparison because the size difference was so fast They actually made that comparison because these two guys were actually relatively close in play things And they were deciding who was going to place where so they didn't do it for fun and this was an actual You know Flavio was that good of a bodybuilder that he was being compared to a 300 plus pound Lou Fragno on the Olympia stage And it's also interesting to note that there were 22 competitors at the 1993 Mr. Olympia So Flavio B almost 10 guys despite being the smallest guy on that Olympia stage in the history of the Mr. Olympia So some of the names you guys might recognize that Flavio B would be Ron Love who placed 14th That's a kind of noticeable name in bodybuilding and also the great Mike Mararozo placing 18th tying for last place with five other bodybuilders Now unfortunately during his entire career with the IFP B Flavio would not win a single pro show During his entire career he would start out in the WABBA bodybuilding organization in 1983 Where he would win their world championships But after coming over to the IFP B in 1988 his best placing would be a second place finish at the 1999 Masters Mr. Olympia And then he would repeat that placing again in the year 2000 again placing second at the Masters Olympia But I think that 13th place at the Mr. Olympia was still a very impressive accomplishment for him Because number one that was a very deep Olympia lineup 22 guys the best in the world For a guy that size to be almost 10 competitors I think is very impressive And then of course if you're talking about Lou Fragnose come back in general With a lot of the hype that's going on lately with the comeback of Kevin LeBroney starting in 2016 And then he recently competed at the 2018 Arnold Australia Comebacks are kind of a hot topic in bodybuilding right now But honestly in my opinion I think that the Lou Fragnose comeback which began in 1992 and would last until 1994 Was one of the most impressive bodybuilder comebacks of all time I'm especially due to the you know the number of years that Lou Fragnose took off The level of fame that Lou Fragnose had Being the incredible hawk being in pumping iron being a bodybuilding legend of the 70s to come back in the 90s and be significantly bigger Probably anywhere from 20 to 30 pounds heavier than he was back in the 70s if not more than that And then also the fact that Lou Fragnose was in his 40s when he would make his comeback When typically most guys in their 40s especially back in the 90s and 80s We're at the end of their bodybuilding career certainly not making comeback to an open division And if you were in your 40s as a competitive bodybuilder you were probably competing in some kind of master's division Because that's where you would be best suited for him to place top 10 at the Mr. Olympia I think was very impressive Because he would come back in 1992 that would be the first year he would appear at the Olympia again since 1975 And he would place 12 in 1992 But he would improve upon that placing from 92 to 93 by two places What I think is very impressive and then in 94 he would make that jump to compete in the masters of Olympia placing second And of course I've also done a whole video on Lou Fragnose versus Dorian Yates Because even though obviously Dorian Yates beat Lou Fragnose pretty easily And the comparison shots of Lou Fragnose next to Dorian Yates from a size standpoint alone Lou Fragnose is door thing Dorian in those shots I mean just from a size standpoint obviously Dorian had the better structure, the better balance The better overall physique because he would go on to win six Olympias But still the comparison was very interesting to see in Olympia legend like Lou Fragnose from the 1970s So that famous pumping iron rivalry with Arnold Schwarzenegger Come back in rival one of the freaky as Mr. Olympia's ever in Dorian Yates From a size perspective because keep in mind Dorian Yates was most known for being one of the first mass monsters ever to win the Olympia He kind of opened up the door for the mass monsters that we see today And Dorian was known for that size So for Lou Fragnose to kind of come out of nowhere and arguably outside Dorian It just made for some very exciting competition and some very cool body-building photos And in my opinion you know that rivalry and those years of his comeback We'll go down in body-building history as some of the coolest things that ever happened in body-building And in the same year you would have him versus Flavio and those photos in and of themselves Also very interesting So I hope you guys enjoyed this
