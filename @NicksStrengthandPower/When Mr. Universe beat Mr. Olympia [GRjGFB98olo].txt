Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's Island Power so I don't make a video about Bill Pearl so Bill Pearl personally It's one of my favorite classic bodybuilders of all time. I have his book keys to the inner universe If you guys are looking for a great bodybuilding book written by golden Arab bodybuilder going through all kinds of different exercises Breaking them down body part by body part and just really key insights In the just classic bodybuilding keys to the inner universe is one of the best books that I have on my bodybuilding bookshelf And I got a side copy which is very very cool So specifically I wanted to make a video about Bill Pearl's 1971 comeback to the mystery universe stage Arguably one of the most impressive comb-backs because of the fact that he became a vegetarian For about three years prior to that comeback so when he went into this 1971 mystery universe He was completely lacto-ovegetarian which meant he only ate eggs and dairy products in addition to obviously vegetables So Bill Pearl has been competing since 1952 and it's competitive career would extend all the way until 1971 Where he would compete in that final mystery universe competition so during the course of his career So he was the first one for professional mystery universe titles 1956 1961 1967 and 1971 So again that was the nabba mystery universe and again I've said this many times with the nabba mystery universe Was the biggest title you could win prior to the mystery Olympia So two of those titles were won before the mystery Olympia even began in 1965 So at the time you could argue in 56 and 61 Bill Pearl was the greatest body builder on the planet for winning pretty much the greatest title that you could win in the 50s and early 60s Which brings up a more interesting point the fact that Bill Pearl never competed in the IFBB and never competed in the mystery Olympia But this did not mean that he would never beat a mystery Olympia winner on stage Bringing me back to that 1971 nabba mystery universe comeback So as many of you know 1971 was a big year for bodybuilding history specifically the history of the IFBB That is the year they entered their non-sanction policy into their rule books which meant if you were an IFBB body builder And you competed in another Federation such as the nabba mystery universe You would be to squallified from entering the Olympia or even banned from the IFBB So again Bill Pearl's 1971 nabba pro universe win would play a big factor in this decision to implement this non-sanction policy So this 1971 mystery universe was held exactly one week prior to the 1971 nabba mystery Olympia And in this nabba mystery universe you had Sergio Aleva who was a former three-time Mr Olympia winner competing and you also had red park competing So unfortunately for Sergio Bill Pearl would defeat Sergio at this nabba mystery universe Despite the fact that Bill Pearl was 41 years old and vegetarian and this was his comeback after he You know quote unquote retired And Bill Pearl really did look phenomenal at this show But again unfortunately for Sergio Aleva this show would be the reason why Sergio Aleva was disqualified from the 1971 Olympia And apparently it would also be the reason that he would play second in 1972 because according to Sergio Aleva Joe Weedor claimed in 1972 that his band had not yet been lifted when he competed in that 72 Olympia So they could not allow him to win So Bill Pearl beating Sergio in 1971 you know really had a big hand in fate for Sergio Aleva And what would happen with Sergio's IAPB career who knows if Sergio would have gone on to continue to compete at the Mr Olympia And possibly beat Arnold one of the years that Arnold would continue to win And immediately after winning that 1971 mystery universe Bill Pearl finally definitively retired After which point he stopped all guest posing and dropped anything related to body building I'm that didn't involve his business where he owned a couple health clubs and gyms And that 71 universe would essentially be his exit from the sport Now Bill Pearl is still alive today at the age of 87 I actually recently got an autograph photo from him just a couple months ago So arguably you know one of the best classic bodybuilders of all time one of my favorite classic bodybuilders And certainly one of the best to not compete in the IFBB So thank you guys for watching the video.
