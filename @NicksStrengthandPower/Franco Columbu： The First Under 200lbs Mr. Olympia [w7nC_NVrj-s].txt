Alright, what's going on you guys Nick here with Nick's on the power so I've done a lot of videos on past Mr. Olympia winners but I realized that I've never really done an in-depth profile on just Franco Colombo so I've done some videos where I've mentioned him and mentioned some things about him but I've never done a video specifically on Franco. Franco Colombo is actually one of the more interesting Mr. Olympia winners being the first Mr. Olympia ever to win the under 200 division at the Mr. Olympia and then also win the overall at the Mr. Olympia and that would be at his first Olympia win in 1976. Now I would say his successor in 1977 in Frank Xan would get more credit for being the main guy that would frequently win the under 200 division and then win the overall the Mr. Olympia Frank Xan winning the under 200 and 7778 in 79 and also winning the overall in 7778 and 79 so when people think of body builders that were smaller guys winning the under 200 but being able to beat bigger guys and win the open overall at the Olympia I think they typically think of Frank Xan in the classical sense instead of thinking of a guy like Franco but Franco was actually the first one to ever do it Now many people are probably familiar with Franco through his association with Arnold Schwarzenegger both of whom who immigrated to America in the late 60s hoping to become body building superstars and live out their dreams over in America Franco Colombo coming from Sardinia Italy and of course you have Arnold Schwarzenegger who was native to Austria Now 1969 Arnold and Franco were working together in America They were being paid by Joe Weedor about $80 a week and it allows us to allow them to work out and be signed under contract with Weedor I'm in addition to that they started a brick-lang business together in California which they called European brick works and this was back in 1969 and that's really where the friendship between Arnold and Franco began was as a business partner and a training partner and that would extend all the way through the filming of pumping iron in 1975 following both of their journeys to the 1975 Mr. Olympia So keep in mind by the time pumping iron was filmed they had been living together in California for about six years Now there are many famous scenes in pumping iron and many other videos and photos of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Colombo training together That's one of the main things they were known for their friendship but also the fact that they were training partners at Goldschim Venice back in the late 60s and early 70s Now the most fascinating thing about that was that even though Franco Colombo was much shorter than Arnold standing about five foot five inches tall and much lighter than Arnold Typically weighing somewhere in the one 90s on stage He was actually much stronger than Arnold and he was actually a very accomplished power lifter Now it's also worth mentioning that prior to the power lifting and the body building He was actually a champion body builder in his younger years over in Italy So all around Franco Colombo was a very genetically gifted athlete No matter what it was whether it was boxing power lifting body building or strongman competition Which I will get to later in this video So let's go into house-strong Franco Colombo actually was So these were all lifts that were recorded at a body weight of 185 pounds This is going to be his best power lifting lifts of the bench press the squat and the deadlift and it's important to note every single one of these lifts Is higher than Arnold's best lift in all of these lifts so if you want to see my video on house-strong Arnold's horse and eggor was I've got that video on my channel as well Where I go into detail about house-strong Arnold was compared to Franco But go check that video out if you want to see that but house-strong was Franco He had a 525 pound bench press or 238 kilograms a 655 pounds squat or 297 kilograms He had a 750 pound deadlift or 340.2 kilograms and that was in competition official lift But claiming in training sessions he had lifted well over 780 pounds or 353.8 kilograms but those weren't reported in an official meet So we're not really counting that but again all of these lifts were done at a body weight of only 185 pounds So pound for pound Franco was a very strong and very impressive body builder slash power lifter But let's get back to the body building here for a minute So in 1976 would be the year that Franco won his first Olympia and that would be the first year at the Olympia that Arnold's horse and eggor did not compete retiring in 1975 to pursue an acting career in Hollywood as we know Arnold would return in 1980 and we would see a similar circumstance with Franco Columbo when he would win his second Mr. Olympia in 1981 So after winning the 1976 Mr. Olympia Franco would take a short hiatus Actually a relatively long hiatus from the competitive stage Beginning with his surprise entry in the 1977 World Strongest Man competition Now in 1977 that was the first ever World Strongest Man so I've covered this before on the channel as well But back in those days there was no strong man organization that fed into The World Strongest Man they basically went around and chose from just various sports where you would think that the person competing in that sport would be strong They would take like the biggest strongest guy from each respective sport They would take the biggest body builders like Luke Fragno or Franco Columbo The biggest football players of that era the biggest pro wrestlers of that era They would take Olympic weight lifters Olympic power lifters And I'm gonna take all these guys It's kind of a hotge podge of competitors and throw them into the World Strongest Man competition So it's exactly what happened in 1977 with Franco Columbo Even though he was much smaller than pretty much every other competitor He was able to place fifth out of eight guys Despite the fact that he was severely injured during the competition There was an event where he would carry a refrigerator on his back I'm enduring that event he collapsed with a refrigerator and essentially severely injured his leg in the process So from 1977 to 1981 you would not see Franco on another bodybuilding stage until that 1980 One Olympia now again many people will say this is one of the most controversial Olympia wins in history Because compared to previous versions of Franco 1981 Franco wasn't the best Franco we had ever seen And one of the reasons for that was the hiatus Another reason was the reason for the hiatus is leg injury His legs certainly weren't up to par in 1981 compared to how they used to be and we think the leg injury was a major reason for that But unfortunately for Franco one of his main competitions in 1981 was the legendary Tom Plats and of course Tom Plats is known for having some of the best leg development bodybuilding history So to go against the guy while you have an injured leg or a recovering leg that's just not the same To go against the guy like Tom Plats it's not gonna look good for you Now another reason why a lot of bodybuilding fans tend to find the 1981 Mr Olympia decision to be somewhat controversial is the fact that Franco Colombo had significantly visible Gina-Commastion stage now if you guys don't know what kind of commastia is Without getting too scientific for you guys it's basically the puffiness around the nipples that you can see on Franco Which is a side effect of anabolic use and recovering from anabolic use That's essentially what causes it In addition to the lackluster legs and the guy in a commastia Arnold Schwarzenegger who was clearly Franco Colombo's best friend pretty much the entirety of his bodybuilding career was one of the promoters of the 1981 Mr Olympia So a lot of people think that due to Arnold's influence over the Olympia judging panel in the Olympia promotion That's a large reason why Franco ended up winning some possible politics and rigging playing into that decision as Resort of Arnold Schwarzenegger's involvement So history will show that Franco Colombo did win the 1981 Mr Olympia defeating Chris Dickerson who took second place Tom Plats who took third Roy Callander who took fourth and in my opinion the most controversial placing of this show was Danny Padilla Placing fifth and I think this is one of the most impressive versions of Danny Padilla that we ever saw And you can see him in the call out for the top three comparing to Franco Comparing to Tom Plats comparing to Chris Dickerson and even though Danny Padilla is a much smaller guy I think he compares very favorably with most of these guys that placed above him So I think that placing of fifth place in my opinion the most controversial decision of that show So aside from his 1976 and 1981 Mr Olympia wins Franco Colombo essentially won every other title In the bodybuilding world except for the Mr America he won the Mr Universe Multiple times the Navib Mr Universe and the IIPB Mr Universe as well as the Mr Europe and the Mr World Winning both of those titles multiple times as well So Franco Colombo is still alive today in fact this past year at the Arnold Classic Expo I actually met Franco Colombo Probably one of the biggest honors that I've ever had in terms of bodybuilders that I've met over the years I've never had the opportunity of meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger The meeting Franco Colombo for me was pretty much on par with meeting Arnold so he is 76 years old He is currently a licensed chiropractor and he will most likely forever go down in bodybuilding history as the original giant killer Because he did win that first under 200 and then overall Mr Olympia title in 1976 but it's also important to note that 1974 Does the first year ever there was an over and under 200 division at the Mr Olympia and Franco was also the first ever winner of the under 200 category period Now in addition to bodybuilding power lifting strongman and boxing he actually did have several movie roles Thanks to Arnold Schwarzenegger obviously the first of which being stay hungry in 1976 He was also in pumping iron of course Conan the barbarian the terminator running man last man standing And various other Schwarzenegger movies where he had little cameos So he was also slightly known for his acting and addition to that he's also the trainer of many celebrities the most famous of which Being so vester Stallone who he prepared For several of the rocky and rambbo movie so the the best physique that Stallone ever had Was really a result of his training with Franco Colombo and as a result of that training here become very good friends Life long friends actually was Schwarzenegger and Franco So that's the video guys.
