Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's on the Power. I'm going to make a video about what I feel is the most interesting version of body building pictures. Now my personal opinion I think the best and most interesting body building photos are when the photos are taken from behind the stage. So when the bodybuilders actually posing towards the crowd But the photo is taken from the back. Now more recently in modern bodybuilding a lot of people will use these photos to show examples of the quote unquote bubblegutt and bodybuilding Because when the bodybuilder is posing from the back say hitting a back double bicep so the back double bicep is facing the crowd They're back as facing the crowd and the front of them is facing back stage. When a photo is taken from backstage Typically the side of the bodybuilder that is facing back stage is the more relaxed side of the bodybuilder Their facial expressions are different typically they'll relax their midsection a little bit as just an interesting angle to see bodybuilding from because typically as fans or spectators or people going to These actual shows and watching in the audience all we see is the side of the bodybuilder presented to the fans presented to the audience So I think some of the best photos in bodybuilding history are the photos that have been taken from backstage more candid photos I'm in just angles that you don't usually see so in particular Arnold Schwarzenegger. I think some of the best and most widely published photos of Arnold our pictures of Arnold taken from the perspective of backstage and not from the perspective of a crowd for example this classic photo of Arnold here kind of spreading his arms I mean how many times have we seen this photo used on like a motivational poster hanging up in a gym hanging up in someone's office I mean hell I had this photo hanging up in my dorm room when I was in college I mean it's one of the best bodybuilding pictures there is and again taken from that backstage perspective Now if you look you know back in time at the 1980 Mr Olympia arguably one of the most controversial Olympia's in history A lot of the most interesting photos to come out of that Olympia or actually the photos taken from the perspective of backstage now the reason for this was during that time There's a crew following Arnold around because it was Arnold's big comeback of Olympia at this time Arnold had already been to Hollywood So the film crews were kind of following his journey from Hollywood back to bodybuilding and they were filming a documentary about it Actually I believe there's a whole DVD about the 1980 Mr Olympia But because of that extra film crew and because of the publicity that Arnold brought to the 1980 Mr Olympia There's a lot of different perspectives and various different angles of the competition and in my opinion I think some of the best photos were taken from behind the stage and the photos the classic photos that you can see Of Arnold and Frank Zane I mean Frank Zane there's one photo in particular this photo right here Where his stomach is actually hanging out a little bit he's hitting a back double bicep pose Arnold is making him laugh As that kind of candid shot where you can see the relaxed version of the bodybuilder I'm in the expressions on their face when they're not facing the crowd Those are the photos that I find to be the most iconic the most interesting the most candid and I just really enjoy looking at him So I put together my collection of all my favorite pictures from the 1980 Mr Olympia And also some of my favorite pictures from other Olympias that Arnold was featured in because typically You know most of these behind the stage pictures were taken in Olympia as that Arnold was at But I'm gonna fast forward a little bit. I believe this was the 1997 Mr Olympia where you had Dorian Yates I'm going head to head with Sean Ray and also head to head with Nasser Elzombati So in these shots you can see all three of them in the comparison around comparing Dorian Nasser and Sean But they're taken from the back and obviously all three of these guys in particular Dorian Had very impressive back so in these shots you can see their backs while they're hitting a front double bicep So it's just the perspective that you don't usually get to see When a bodybuilder hits a front double bicep on stage at the Mr Olympia Typically the only photos you see of that front double bicep are from the front So it's interesting to see a bodybuilder with a crazy develop back What their back looks like when they're hitting a front double bicep because not the same position as when they're hitting a back Double bicep the back looks different. It's kind of more expanded It's not so much contracted like it is in the back double bicep and I think one of the coolest ones here is Dorian and Nasser both about to hit a rear last spread so again something you just never see is a rear last spread What it looks like from the front side of the body? I mean you can see this photo again in 1980 of Arnold and Frank Xane again a very interesting perspective of what a back last spread looks like from the front Very different from what a front last spread looks like So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I thought it was a good collection of photos that maybe a lot of you guys haven't seen before Just some cool photos that you know really aren't out there that much or publish as much Especially these 1997 Mr Olympia photos. I don't I haven't seen these published too often I haven't really seen anybody use these in videos or anything So I hope you guys enjoyed the video Please go ahead and subscribe with this channel if you want to see more bodybuilding content like that go ahead and give the video a thumbs up Thank you guys for watching Nick strength and power signing out
