All right, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's time to power. So obviously one of the biggest topics in the fitness industry right now is the calom von Moga Incident where he was doing some kind of cliff jumping and he ended up dislocating his kneecap and rupturing his quad tenement And keep in mind this is in addition to the bicep tear that he suffered I guess a couple months ago now When he attempted to curl four hundred and five pounds and conjunction with Chris bombs that's there both over You know basically what most people max deadlift would be on a straight barbell Loader with four plates on each side and they tried to curl it tandemly and the end of up tearing his bicep doing that So the main question is is calom von Moga's career over? I think the answer to that question is going to be both yes and no so yes in the regard that this leg injury the bicep injury That's probably going to put a significant setback on his intention to compete in the Olympia I mean he said before his main goal was to get to the Olympia stage and compete in classic physique So I think the bicep thing combined with his leg thing I mean this is going to be a significant hindrance to him and from a time frame standpoint I think competitively it's going to set him back significantly I'm in from a physique standpoint. I think it's going to take away from his physique tremendously in terms of his overall balance I don't know if it's something he could ever come back from In terms of having completely equal, you know one arm to the other biceps and completely equal one leg to the other quadriceps having torn one quad and one bicep I think there's always going to be some kind of visible difference on each side of his body And as we know one of the main points of judging and body building is going to be the symmetry of the physique So how even each side of the body is and how proportional each side of the body is I think that's really going to throw off his proportions and symmetry So I think whereas before he really did have potential to be very successful in classic physique I think he could have gone to the classic physique Olympia not necessarily one But I think had he made it to the classic physique Olympia in 2018 We could have certainly seen Calenvon Mogur in that top six collar I think he would have been a threat to the show I don't know that he would have necessarily won it Having it been his first Olympia. I think he would have done pretty well though He does have the classic physique structure and he has the height on his side as well Which seems to be an advantage for people that are competing in classic physique? So competitively yes, this may have ended his competitive career or potentially set him back significantly towards you know how he could have done Had he never been injured and that being said I watched a couple of videos where people were talking about his injury and I think people were being a little bit too hard on him saying You know what was he doing jumping off this cliff anyway if I were a body builder I would stick you know strictly to body building you shouldn't do anything else It's dangerous. I don't necessarily agree with that calenvon Mogur isn't strictly a body builder This guy is a massive social media person I mean honestly his career isn't body building. It's being you know on social media It's selling his clothing. It's selling his brand. It's advertising and promoting himself And obviously I will agree that you know the trying to curl 405 pounds That was a pretty stupid move when you're curling 400 pounds I mean you've got to expect there's a high probability that you could get injured but something like repelling off a cliff I think this will simply have freak accident. It's kind of silly to say What was he doing repelling off a cliff? He's a body builder. He's got to think of his body first and while I do understand that logic I mean clearly no one no one goes repelling off a cliff thinking about injuring their you know Patel attendant so people that are calling him stupid and saying he should have done it I don't really agree with that. He could have never predicted this was gonna happen He was probably he was certainly doing it for his Instagram I mean he was filming the thing and his main business like I said is promoting himself on Instagram So I don't really blame him because essentially what he was doing was a publicity stunt for his Instagram to get views to get likes to get attention I mean that was the goal and that's his business and Unfortunately for him it just happened to go severely wrong So I think from a social media standpoint his career's never gonna be over I mean he's always gonna be calmed on motor He's starting that movie bigger playing the part of Arnold Schwarzenegger I think he's probably got a tremendous career ahead of him in terms of maybe some acting or mainstream Filmmorles and he's always gonna have that presence on social media I think you know the video of him falling off the cliff alone I think that got 1.5 million views on his Instagram and just a couple of days So I think a large majority of his followers probably won't really care whether he ever competes again or not Probably won't care how good he does if he does compete again Because they follow him because he's calmed on moka They don't follow him because you know this is how he placed at this show They follow him because he's a character. He's a social media character So I think honestly he'll he'll be fine. He'll come back from this Probably not come back in a competitive sense, but as calmed on moga the social media guy I think he's gonna be fine So let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about calmed on moga I mean how injury prone he seems to have been please give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it next time of power signing out
