Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's on the power so today I want to talk about a bodybuilder who I couldn't even call a golden aerobody builder because it competed for over 50 years as a bodybuilder But he started out in the golden era even a little bit before the golden era competing with the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbo in the 1960s Mr. Universe competitions so this bodybuilder is named John Citron so John Citron is arguably one of the greatest bodybuilders to come out of the UK and again I want to emphasize the fact that he's been competing for over 50 years starting in 1964 competing in the nabumister universe and the nabumister Britain being his first show ever All the way until as recently as 2005 where he won the nabum master's world championships 50 plus and he also won the nabum european championships in the master's 50 plus division as well placing second at the nabumister universe and the master's division that year also So not only did he compete for over 50 years but he competed and stayed on top for over 50 years Well, never becoming an IFBB pro So this is the reason why a lot of you guys may not have heard of John Citron because the fact that he was never a pro I'm in the IFBB which is the most well known professional bodybuilding organization there is But in nabum he was arguably one of the best bodybuilders to come out of Europe to compete in the nabum organization Now for those of you who don't remember the nabumister universe competition was around far before The first Mr. Olympia competition was ever held so the nabumister universe used to be the most prestigious title You could win in bodybuilding and before the IFBB the nabum was basically it so nabum Was basically the highest tier that you could be as a professional bodybuilder before the IFBB came along So during his 50 year competitive career he won a total of eight missed universe titles two mr world titles and he also holds a British Bench press record And in addition to that he also holds several mr Britain titles So John actually had a really impressive physique during the 1960s in the gold narrow bodybuilding But the amazing thing was the fact that he was able to improve upon that physique as he got older Becoming in my opinion one of the most impressive masters competitors that we've ever saw in the 50 plus division Some of these photos you're looking at right now This guy one of the most conditioned well muscled just overall Jacked 50 plus bodybuilders that you're ever gonna see So if we rewind a little bit back to John's atron's golden era days He was actually a very impressive golden era bodybuilder Not just from the physique standpoint, but from the placing standpoint as well So he was competing in the nab mystery universe before Arnold ever did I mean he's actually competing in the first mystery universe that Arnold ever won in 1967 and John's atron actually won the short division of that mystery universe while Arnold won the amateur division of the 1967 mystery universe and of course John would also compete in the 1968 and Professional nabby universes both of those years Arnold Schwarzenegger also won the title And since John was competing in the short division he would often go head to head with Franco Columbo Beating him in some cases So as we all know Arnold Schwarzenegger would go on to win seven mystery Olympias in the IFB Franco Columbo would go on to win two So who knows what John's atron would have been able to do had he you know migrated over to the IFB and pursued an Olympia title Because he was very very successful in nabba to the point where he was rubbing shoulders with Arnold winning the universe Side by side with Arnold and beating Franco at the universe as well So I just wanted to make a quick video on this guy because I'm sure a lot of you haven't heard of him again because of the IFB thing But in terms of nabba this guy was one of the greatest to ever do it. He had one of the most impressive careers in terms of longevity The number of wins the number of universe wins and just the number of title wins in general I thought the fact that you know he was rubbing shoulders with Schwarzenegger and these guys Back in the 60s Then he would go on a compete for you know 40 more years and still be dominant is as they very very impressive Fact about his physique because you know Arnold will only go on to compete for about a decade more and Franco is well Now, whereas this guy's career extended maybe 30 more years past More Franco and Arnold both stopped So I hope you guys enjoyed the video.
