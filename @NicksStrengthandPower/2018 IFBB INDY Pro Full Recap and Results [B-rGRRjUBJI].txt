I was going on you guys, Nick here when they've five and a power so we are headed up to the Indie Pro and Indianapolis in Vienna It's the first year after that we're holding this pro show We've got Luke Sando, Steve Kuhl, we did Taughty on the G-C, Aaron Clark In 2012, we got Silvio Samo making us come back I don't think it's a good deal in Lampias since the early 2000s I think it was the top 10 place or back then But he's doing the 2012 now I'm in based on the call-outs that I saw earlier We didn't make it up to pre-junk but I was looking at some of the photos Pre-junk looks like he was up there in the center of the 2012 call-outs I guess he's going to be doing pretty well And then the open call-outs, Steve Kuhl, in the middle Luke Sando in the middle The guy named Charles Griffith I think Luke Kuhl has been most likely to have that guy in my prediction video But apparently he's doing pretty well So we're going to try to get you guys some footage from the show So I'm trying to vlog a little bit of whatever behind the scenes stuff that we can get I did spots of the show so we're going to see my logo up on the stage So I don't know what kind of behind the scenes stuff we can give with these VIP passes And I got him with the fact that I'm sponsoring the show But he'll be able to do something or go back to stay If I get to meet something he's pros I'm going to do something that regular people don't get to do I'll see if we can get three guys so for about 20 minutes away now So we're going up soon and we'll start recording the show for you guys Dad, I think it says that I know that He did He did he did he did he did it He did he did it He did he did it He did it He did it He did it He did Luke Sando Luke Sando He did it He did it He did it He did it So this is my buddy's act I really appreciate him coming out because he's one week off from his body really shown The natural person is a maddie You're going to be saying a lot of footage of that on the channel next week as well So this is going to be the first vlog that you see for 2018 It's like so small Yeah The second vlog will be prepping him full of natural sense of maddie And the footage of a natural sense of maddie And I'm also sponsoring that show as well So that'll be cool for you guys to see if you guys haven't seen the behind the scenes Inside of a natural body full of show I'm trying to share you guys with the tannin Did a nice clip based on nail Let's get close to tannin on it So that should be fun What are doing? Alright guys so I just got back from the 2018 Indy Pro in Indianapolis, Indiana I just wanted to make a recap video Kind of going over the placings here But first I wanted to thank Dave Bowers for putting on the show The show was amazing It was very well run The venue was absolutely beautiful So this is the first year ever that they've done the Indy Pro It's a brand new pro show on the pro circuit So I wanted to go to it It was close by I sponsored the show As I'm sure you guys will see in some of the videos and pictures in this video You can see my logo off to the side on the left hand side of the stage So I thought hey It's a brand new pro show Let's sponsor it And I'm giving it some coverage And help it kind of get off the ground here So I'm glad I sponsored it I'm glad I went because it was a great show So the men's open You had Steve Ku Klow winning You had Charles Griffin in second You had Luke Sando in third You had Ian Veier in fourth Justin Rodriguez in fifth And Roman Fritz in sixth place So these placings are pretty much what I expected And pretty much what I predicted with the exception of a couple guys So one of the guys that kind of came out of nowhere For me was Charles Griffin the guy that took second And I got to say man This is a guy that we should be looking out for in the future Because this guy looked amazing His conditioning was on point His very impressive physique, very impressive structure His biceps specifically He's got a very impressive front double bicep pose The dude just looked great all around And honestly this is a guy that I didn't really see coming As a number two guy So you know I want to give him props in this video Because I didn't really have him in my predictions He kind of came out and nowhere surprised me So prize a lot of people This guy looked really really good Definitely deserve that second place spot And in fact Steve Ku Klow is my boy I think he's got a great physique There were some points when they were comparing the two of them I was getting a little bit worried for Steve Ku Klow Because Charles Griffin looked that good to me I thought he was very impressive But overall I felt that Steve Ku Klow deserved the win So you had Luke Sando and third place And I predicted that he would be in second Really the main problem for Luke Sando was his conditioning Again both of the top two guys had really good conditioning Steve Ku Klow and Charles Griffin We're both shredded to the bone And I think that I saw Luke Sando As he looked pretty good from the front A lot of the photos of the front he looks very massive He looks pretty lean But when he turned around you could definitely see that conditioning was a problem Now I'm a big fan of Luke Sando as well Again I've said this many times I think he has a physique that's very reminiscent of Doria and Yates He's got posing that's very reminiscent of Doria and Yates And he's got all the size to be a top contender at the Arnold Classic A top contender at the Mr. Olympia But the conditioning is the problem So to be honest with you guys when Luke Sando turned around and started hitting poses from the back I became worried that he might not be in the top six Because personally I was sitting maybe three or four rows from the front row We had very good seats And personally when he turned around from the back he started posing I mean there were areas on his body That were just actually jiggling because there was either water or fat there And you know just a conditioning from the back It just wasn't good at this show I think he looked much better in Australia And I think he could have been a little bit harder and drier Actually a lot harder and drier at the show And how he done that he probably a little bit been a contender for the top spot So he and Vair this is another guy That kind of surprised me here placing forth But I gotta say he had a pretty impressive physique as well Conditioning was on point He's got really great shape, really great size It's got a really good V-Taper really small waist This is another very impressive guy that I think we should be looking out for in the future And number five we had Justin Luis Rodriguez This is another guy I had in my predictions As the top six guy this was a guy that impressed me at the New York pro I believe he got fourth place back in the New York pro And he looked very impressive here as well And in that six place spot we have another guy that I said in my prediction video Might be top six that is Roman Fritz So Roman Fritz looked very impressive as well He's got a very he's a little bit smaller than some of the other guys He's got a very classic physique, very aesthetic physique And just very good lines overall He had a little bit more size I think he would be a much bigger threat to these guys He is certainly noticeably smaller than them in my opinion But I think his lines and aesthetics are so good Combined with his conditioning that that would land him in the top six spot at this show So next we have the two 12 division So the two 12 was actually very interesting to wash There are some cool things that happened there So on first place you have Charles the tank Dixon Not predicted that as well in my prediction video Based on his second place finish at the Arnold Classic I thought for sure you know this was a show he was going to come in and win And I was correct in that regard Number two, you got a guy that kind of took me by surprise Jacob Wilson would take second place This was a guy you know he really wasn't even on my radar at all In this two 12 division He came in I think the reason he placed second was his conditioning was so damn good Probably one of the hardest guys on stage at night He looked very very impressive from a conditioning standpoint Structure standpoint as well very good V-Taper Very small waste overall very impressive bodybuilder And Jacob Wilson But I think the main story of the two 12 division is silvio Samuel making his comeback and placing third here So when I read the list the first time I saw silvio Samuel's name on the list I thought for sure it couldn't be the same silvio Samuel I'm sure there's another two 12 guy named silvio Samuel That wasn't the same silvio Samuel that we saw you know competing in the Olympia years ago Now back in 2007 2008 silvio Samuel was a top 10 finisher at the Mr. Olympia placing 7th both of those years I'm in a 2009 he would tie for 12th place at the 2009 Olympia Now after that he would take a fairly long hiatus from the sport of bodybuilding I believe the cause was he spent some time in prison I mean he's kind of trying to refocus his life a little bit So today yesterday actually at the age of 42 he would come back Almost the full decade later after his last competition And take third at this indie pro show in the 2012 division And I got to say I think he could have made an argument for him getting second His posing routine was great I really enjoyed his posing routine a great kind of classical posing It's physique look great Especially for a 42 year old guy making a comeback after a very long hiatus And I think overall he just looked phenomenal man I wish I knew he was making a comeback I didn't hear anything about the fact that he was making a comeback And you know I'm a guy that pays attention to this sort of thing I didn't hear anything about it So when I saw him when I saw that name on the list I didn't even have him in my predictions because I didn't even realize He knows the same guy this guy hasn't competed in over a decade But yeah he looked very good and he definitely deserved that third place spot So on fourth you have Ahmed Elcedani he looked very impressive as well In fifth you had a mod, a mod and in sixth you had a guy sister You know so guy sister Nina was another guy I didn't know he was competing either I didn't see him on that list I did see I think a day or two prior People were tagging him and indie pro stuff and he was hashtagging indie pro So I figured at that point he was doing it But I think what we saw here was a good guy sister But not necessarily a great guy sister Nina and that's why he took sixth So finally I just wanted to mention I had the opportunity at the end The kind of talk to Steve Kuklo for a little bit It was really cool to get to meet the guy for a second time I met him up at the Arnold Classic at the meet and greet there Then I told him we talked a little bit on Instagram and he said hey we should meet up at this indie pro And when we talked at the indie pro we said we want to do some kind of collaboration together Whether that be an interview or whatever ends up happening So you're definitely going to see something between Steve Kuklo and myself Very soon on my channel I think this guy I mean it's definitely a guy that's kind of been off the radar for a couple years now You know myself included you know being a body-building fan I hadn't had you know Steve Kuklo on my radar for a couple of years But then I think after that Arnold Classic appearance in 2018 where he placed fifth He would put himself on a lot of people's radars and he really put himself on the map Then he comes in and does a pro show right after In this indie pro and wins it in my opinion kind of an easy win for him So Steve Kuklo is certainly back on the map And I'm actually you know I'm very excited to see what this guy does I'm excited to see how he does with the Olympia this year I think you got to say you know he's a favorite to be in the top 10 of this year's Mr. Olympia Possibly even the top six I mean this is a guy where I think a lot of the reason why he placed so highly at the Arnold Classic Was the fact that his conditioning was so good I'm again at the indie pro he had really good conditioning And what's one of the main complaints that we see with guys in the Olympia stage conditioning and bubble guts So Steve Kuklo can come in with this crazy conditioning I think it's certainly a possibility that he could crack into the top six But I think in all likelihood he's definitely going to be a top 10 contender at the Mr. Olympia this year I'm very excited to see what he can do So let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about the results of the 2018 indie pro Thank you guys for watching the video and please give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it Next strength and power signing out
