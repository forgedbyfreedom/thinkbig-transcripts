All right, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's Diamond Power. I was wanting to make a video giving a huge shout out to my boy Wesley Visters over advantage genetics. You may recognize him from winning my Mr. Golden era competition earlier in 2017, but he recently today actually got his IFBB pro card by winning the Royal London bodybuilding show. So now his road to the Mr. Olympia Classic Visite stage officially begins. So now all these hypotheticals we were talking about of what if he competes in the Olympia, how would he do against the classic physique line of of Breon Ainsley, Chris Bumstedt, some of these guys. All that stuff is going to become a reality now because he's an IFBB pro. And now his road to the Olympia begins. All he has to do is qualify which in classic physique. You think it'd be a little bit harder than it is, but I think he's actually got for him. I think it's going to be a pretty easy road to get to the Olympia stage. And I think it's going to be a pretty easy road to be in that top six. So I think this is a very exciting day for classic physique. I think we're going to see amazing things from Wesley Visters in the future. And this is just the beginning of his journey man. So I'm very proud of him. I'm really happy to have had him on my channel doing the Mr. Golden era competition. And hopefully we see him on that Olympia stage in 2018. Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about Wesley Visite physique. Please give the video a thumb up if you enjoyed it. Next rank and power signing out.
