Alright, what's going on you guys in Nick here when Nick's on the power so Lee Priest recently put a pretty interesting post up on Instagram So Lee Priest was talking about the Mr. Olympia in the classic physique division So let me read you guys exactly what Lee Priest posted here So he says out on a limb here, but I think the Mr. Olympia will be done after this year The men's open will probably be gone like the women's and more will be put on the classic physiques and the other divisions to make this sport more mainstream so I'm assuming he means more emphasis will be put on the classic physiques and the other divisions So this is an interesting comment coming from Lee Priest. This is a guy that came from the 90s and early 2000s Competing against a lot of the guys that many considered to be the golden era body building in the 1990s And Lee Priest himself never was a mass monster. He was always a smaller guy I mean he would beat guys based on you know the aesthetics of his physique essentially the lines the proportions And the shape of his physique and that's really the kind of the same thing that classic physique is emphasizing It's not so much how big you are It's the lines in the structure of your physique that's gonna make you win because they have those weight classes in classic physique So technically Lee Priest has always kind of been a proponent of that mindset That size isn't everything And Lee Priest of course in the past has been outspoken About today's body builders and the bubble guts And the size of some of these guys and the physiques and how the conditioning isn't as good as it once was So I definitely think Lee Priest is being genuine here and he's always kind of had a somewhat negative opinion towards the current state Of the IFBV that's never really been a secret But I've got to say I kind of disagree with him here. I do think classic physique over time Is going to certainly become more and more popular and certainly will help to make this sport more and more quote-unquote main stream But I think it's not gonna be after this year I think it's gonna take a lot more time than that And do I think it will ever surpass the men's open mr. Olympia that's really hard to say I think at all likelihood it probably won't I do think with time You know classic physique could become up there as one of the most popular divisions at the mr. Olympia I think at the end of the day men's open is probably always going to be the thing that sells the most tickets has the most interest and it's always gonna be You know the crazy freakyest pinnacle of the sport that people are gonna want to watch The Super Bowl of body building and I think classic physique could become a close second to that It could become one in two People want to see the main Olympia first But they want to see you know the classic physique Olympia just as much or just a little bit less But it is kind of refreshing to see a men's open body builder likely priest Recognize the popularity that classic physique does have because in many cases A lot of the men's open body builders including seven-time mr. Olympia feel he's have been outspoken about kind of not liking the classic physique division And thinking it's not gonna have any impact at all on men's open body building So you know, I don't really think it's gonna overtake men's open body building But to say that it's not gonna have any impact on Regular body building. I think that's just a ludicrous statement But again with the weekend warrior comments from guys like Phil Heath and even Jose Raymond has said similar things So a lot of body builders across the board I've had kind of this attitude towards classic physique like it's just an easier division It's not gonna be Ever as popular as men's open body building. I don't necessarily agree with that But again, it's just refreshing to see a guy like Lee priest having this attitude and recognizing how popular classic physique is getting That's one of the things that I've seen on my channel over time is the interest of shifting From videos on men's open body builders to people wanting more and more videos on classic physique I mean I get more requests for you know videos on crisp bumps to Wesley vissers mr. proper Breon ainsley the classic physique Olympia then I get you know I actually don't really get any requests for make a video on Phil Heath But I get requests every single day You're talking about this classic guy talk about that classic guy. Did you see this guy's guess posing? The interest is definitely there and I'm seeing it firsthand and it's good to see a guy like Lee priest recognize that Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about Lee priest comments on classic physique surpassing men's open body building after this year's Olympia I'm thank you guys for watching the video and please give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it next time of power signing out
