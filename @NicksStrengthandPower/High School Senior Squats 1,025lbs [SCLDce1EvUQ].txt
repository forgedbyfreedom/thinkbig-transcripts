Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick Schenner Power. I was only going to expand my series on the strongest high schoolers. A couple of days ago I did a video on the best high school bench press that I could find on a kid that bench press 700 pounds at the age of 18 years old back in 2013. Now for this video I want to focus on the strongest squat that I could find by a high schooler. This was a more recent one done in 2017. So this guy's name is Joseph Paine. Now this guy is a Texas high school student and that's interesting because the last guy that I did a video on that did the 700 pound bench press was also a Texas high school student. Joseph Paine at the age of 18 in 2017. He had a 1,025 pound equipped back squat. During that meet he was doing an IPF sub junior meet. This was a very legitimate powerlifting meet. His final lifts were a 1,025 pound squat, a 515 pound bench press, and a 625 pound deadlift. So unlike the guy in my last video that was a bench press specialist Joseph Paine has actually strong all the way around. Now at the age of 18 he stood out about a height of 6 foot 1 in just hall and weighed about 310 pounds at the time of this competition. Now some of you may be saying well that was just an equipped squat. It doesn't count because it was an a raw squat. Well at the age of 17 Joseph Paine's best raw squat was 855 pounds and that was in 2016. And then if you fast forward to 2018 so now at the age of 19 Joseph Paine is quad at 914 pounds raw as a super heavyweight power lifter. So this guy is the real deal man. It's not just about squatting equipped. He's really legitimately really really strong regardless of what kind of squat suit he's wearing. So even though the main focus of this video was his 1,000 pound squat when he was in high school. Since he graduated high school he competed most recently at the USAPL American Royal Nationals. And at that meet he were all his best lifts. So he had that 915 pound raw squat or 415 kilograms, a 440 pound bench press or 200 kilograms. And a 661 pound deadlift with 300.5 kilograms to total 2,014 pounds or 915.5 kilograms. So I would say in terms of the squat this guy is by far the strongest high school power lifter that I could find. A thousand pounds whether it was equipped or not for any high school or to do that is just a super human feat of strength. And the 800 pound squat at the age of 17 raw. I mean it just really doesn't get that much more impressive than that. Now even though this guy is a bigger guy we are still talking about some serious weight here. So despite the fact he's a super heavyweight this is still in same strength for anybody of his age. And this guy has tremendous potential. And I'm very interested to see what he's able to do in power lifting going forward. So let me know what you guys think in the comment section below. Please give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it. Next time of power signing out.
