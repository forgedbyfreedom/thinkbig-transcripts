Alright, what's going on, you guys? Nick here with Nick's on the Power. So obviously yesterday we had the Classic Vizic Division at the 2018 Chicago Pro. And today of course we have the men's open body building division of the Chicago Pro. Now the biggest name obviously in this show is going to be Sergio LeVaduño coming back to his hometown looking to pick up the win and pick up this title to add to his collection with that New York Pro win that he took away in 2017. So for the most part I think Sergio actually did look very good here. I do think he improves some things on his physique. I think his legs look noticeably bigger, overall his posing was good. And based on the callouts he's looking like he's going to be in the top three for sure, probably the winner of the show, which is what a lot of people expected to begin with. This isn't early that deep of a lineup here. And the top three is looking to be Sergio LeVaduño just in Luis Rodriguez and Michael Lockett. My guess would be Justin Luis Rodriguez takes second and Michael Lockett takes third here. And most likely we're going to see Sergio LeVaduño pick up the win. Again, not really that deep of a lineup, not really that deep of a show. In fact, I think the Classic Vizic Division was actually more exciting at the Chicago Pro than the men's open was because it was really the pro debut of Wesley Visitors. I think a lot more people were excited about that than you know, just served you in a couple other guys competing. So that's the pre judging for the 2018 Chicago Pro. Stay tuned for later on in the day. In the finals come out. I will report those results on the channel as well. Thank you guys for watching the video and please give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
