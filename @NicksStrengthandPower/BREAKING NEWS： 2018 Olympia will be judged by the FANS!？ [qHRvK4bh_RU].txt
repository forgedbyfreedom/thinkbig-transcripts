Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick time to power with some breaking news for you guys from an early release of the July edition of the Muscle and Fitness Magazine. There's a section in that magazine called the Olympia Insider. There's an article just written that the 2018 Mr. Olympia will have a People's Champion option. This says in this article that the fans will be able to judge each competitor and rank them and the fan scores will count in the official judging decision. I mean, this is revolutionary guys. This changes the whole Mr. Olympia judging process and I think this is an answer to all the social media reaction to last year's Mr. Olympia. All the talk about the bubble guts. All the talk about Phil Heath not deserving to win. I mean, I think this is proof that the powers that be are listening to what people say and do care about the fans opinion. And then it even goes on to say if the judges pick a different winner than the fans, the competitor of the fans chose will also be crowned Mr. Olympia but they'll be crowned the Mr. Olympia People's Champion. This development was made by Jim Manion and of course, Am I President David Pecker. That's the news guys. Please let me know what you guys think in the comments section below. Nick time for power signing out.
