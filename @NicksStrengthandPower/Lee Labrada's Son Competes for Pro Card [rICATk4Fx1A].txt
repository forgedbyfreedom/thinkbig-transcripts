Alright, what's going on you guys? Nick here with Nick's other powers with all the excitement surrounding the New York pro. I think a lot of people might forget that the NPC Junior Nationals is today and the NPC Junior Nationals is a pro qualifying show. In that show we have Leela Brottis Sun, Hunter Lebrottis, competing for his pro card this weekend. And I gotta say based on the videos that I've seen on his Instagram and some of other pictures that I've seen, he looks phenomenal and I think the chances are very high that we're gonna see Leela Brottis Sun get his pro card tonight. So I just wanted to make this video because I didn't want the NPC Junior Nationals to get overshadowed by the New York pro hype because I think this is actually a very big deal if Leela Brottis Sun does in fact get his pro card. It's cool to have another legacy IPB competitor where a father and son are both pros. I'm gonna be interested to see where Hunter Lebrottis able to take his pro career if he does in fact earn his pro card tonight. So let me know what you guys think in the comment section below about Hunter Lebrottis Fizzique and how he's looking at the NPC Junior Nationals. Do you think he's gonna get his pro card and how do you think he will do as a competitive pro? Thank you guys for watching the video. Please give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed it. Next time the power signing out.
