Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car mock tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love it to show. This is our best place to be in LA. When you're asleep, they're just getting started. John, D's, after hours. Welcome back to After Hours, I'm D. Pulum, though, in John and Monos in Limbo right now, but he'll be joining us later, but I'm here with my good friend Greg Valentino to start the show off. What's up, Greg? And not much, I'm still in shock of a ricochet, because I'm not that he was a good guy and he knew Rick my God, 40-something years. Yeah, you know, it's funny because Rick and I would have this relationship where we would, you know, he would come on my show, I'd go and his show, we would talk like almost every day texting and stuff at that, and then we wouldn't talk for a while, but then he could just call me up out and know where I could call him out and know where we would just talk for like, you know, like 45 minutes an hour. He's just that kind of guy, you didn't have to like, you didn't have to like try to be his friend, if you were his friend, you were his friend, you know, and, uh, absolutely. It's weird because his son did a video on his channel saying that his dad had, you know, Rick had a knee replacement, I guess sometimes what happens is you get these infections and these joint replacements, that's what scares me when I show this. And once they, if you get an infection in that joint, and they got a cake that joint down, the artificial joint, and they got to put like antibiotic beads in there, and they can't put the joint back in right away. They got to go back like six weeks later and do it. So he was in the process of having that happen and he said his dad was doing well. And then like four days later, he was like, so I don't know really what the cause of death was officially. To me, you know, from what Rick was saying, he was having trouble breathing, it almost sounds COVID-ish, you know, I don't know if it was, but, uh, it wasn't. What, what, what, so what was it? John Romano, yeah. Yeah, what he had kidney issues, yeah, stuff was just a little bit. Yeah, he had a kidney. Yeah, but John, I mean, COVID affects all the organs, heart, you know, especially in older people, heart, kidney. That's, specifically on the, on the thing I read online, it had nothing, no COVID involvement at all. Well, they don't, we don't know because there wasn't, you think they were at a COVID test on them? I run a COVID test if you go to the fucking dentist, they run a COVID test everywhere. Yeah. He's right about that. I can take it. I've taken on a how many COVID testaries. I won the Y was reporting that he was having trouble breathing though. That was what, um, was it? He wrote it himself. Have you been following his, yeah, no, he said he was breathing. He had breathing problems though. Right. Right. That's why it was saying, but he said not, but he's, but he said not, but related. Oh, okay. All right. Well, you know, who knows? The fact is that we lost him. I mean, I don't know if maybe at a heart attack, you know, it's part of the world. It's possible, you know, he's 76. He was very, he was very ill. He'd be sick and then not do videos for a while. Then he came back. Oh, he's out. So this is going on. I got to be going on. He's been going on. He's been going on in the hospital all year. I remember back when I was work when I was a man, I had labs and stuff. I could talk with him, you know, I've done videos with Rick. And he, you know, he would be out for a while and come back. Because his health was not so great, you know? He reminds me of like a, well, he was older obviously, but he reminds me of a done to rip a rust, you know, like a hardcore body built into a rude, like, you know, guy for life, you know, type of thing. And I thought he didn't, he designed the joke, the joke, the joke, the gold. The gold, Jim logo in the world. Jim logo in the world. And the world, Jim logo. Yeah. He actually, he drew a gold, you know, the gold, Jim guy. He drew me in like an original like a little drawing of it and signed it for me. I have it up on my wall. I kind of put it up on my video. I should have just a world Jim eighth too, right? Yeah. Yeah. He did, he did all this. Do you know what's funny? He, he, he, he, he, he, he could play piano too. I'm not the piano to put the guitar. He's a good guitarist. He's an artist. All the fuckers. He was a very, he was very artistic. He was like, and, uh, do you read the ball? I can't believe I got on this fucking thing. I'm in the truck. I got to install this and install that. Press this, put your name. Put your, I'm going to the truck over here. You did it. You did it. You pulled it off. But then what happened? Well, hello, what happened to you? What happened to you last week? Press that. I, we all in the show. We just bullshit. We're each other right now. We're always on the show. You're always on the show. I didn't know because you know, I, I fucked up. I'm over here to fuck it on the very work finally over here. I did the Brooklyn, I don't know. You've been done it. Great. What's the next time you're just a Brooklyn bro? Well, I've been, uh, probably about two, three months ago. But let me tell you something. That fucking van Wick when I was in high school. That, the bill parkway, they were working on that. Here we are fucking 40 some years later. It's still working on it. Well, I'm an expressway too. Fucking exit from the Bronx. They bridge. They work on that for 45 fucking years. But there's a lot. And I think it's going to be shit. I was on the fucking bed. There's a classic, there's a classic sign fell down. So where, Elaine has got this guy staying with her. And he wants to get rid of him. And she oversleep, striving him to the airport. And she's like, I'm going to get him here. And he's like, there's no way we're going to make it. We only have 15 minutes. He's like, she's like, oh, make it. I'll make it. And then she hits the van Wick expressway. Because that's the ultimate joke if you are great. Van Wick is like, you can be flying. And then all of a sudden you hit the van Wick. And it's like, bumper to bumper. Nineteen 76, right? I got my license. I was driving on that fucking road. And he would do already do construction. It's scary. It's a scary road. Let me try your memory. I think I look at the van Wick. He's the fucking van Wick right now. I'm going to talk to him. I was just the way, the like, Dave said I was cruising along. I got a load on. I got to do great fucking time. I get off the condo and bam, very weak. And then it says, accident. Three lanes close. The race. It's actually three lanes on the van Wick. Hey, three lanes is a fucking load. What the fuck is that mean? There's only three lanes on his phone. The fucker. The mean's your a bit. It means you're a deep shit. It means you're going to be sitting there for a whole time. I should have got off this car, suck up. I shouldn't have went down the car, though. It's a fucking Springfield. I went through Jamaica. That's what I usually fucking somebody said. I don't mean that's my game. I'm coming down this fucking fucking hell. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at this. I'm in a parking lot. I'm in a shit. Don't you fucking open. Fucking bullshit. Look at the other side. Look at the other side. It's flying. Look at the other side. I'm in a really slow. When you're on it. But when you're on it, but when you're on it, I think the fucking hell I eat. Well, you guys live. I think that's worse. Oh, I didn't get today. Yeah, Greg. Wait. I still got to get on that one. The fucker. That's what I'm going right now. The fucking hell I eat. Wait, talk to you. I mean, I'll be at all it costs a fuck. I'm doing a single fucking New York shit. I don't know about you, Greg. I am fucking tired. I absolutely do. You say it. I want to throw up. That's what I'm saying. I'm sick of it. You know what's funny though with the LIE? Does not just you'd stuck it traffic. And then you start moving a little bit. And then they tell you, on exit this, and it's going to be traffic. They warn you. But then there's no, but there's no reason. There's no construction. I just think people float out. I'm not. I was just coming down to God. I'm doing. Clearers are fucking. Clearers have. Right? I'm coming all the sudden. I see all these red lies. I said, should I get off? I said, nah, I'm not. I fucking. I could have got off. I still haven't stayed at God, dude. I stand at God, though, it's pop, but I'm pop, but this is just before. Before I got it in the bear with. I said, all this stuff. I fucking hour. What did that all said I got this? Found that shit. And then I always cones. And I'm going to all these cones. It's single-file. I get up there, bro. There's nobody there. That's just... That's just... I'm going to walk it about. That's what you said. You're going to walk it about. Yeah, sure. You're going to walk it about. Yeah, sure. You're going to walk it about. No, but that's what I think. You're going to do it in night. Do it in night. Do it in night. Right, motherfucker. No, motherfucker. I don't understand. Well, the time. Like, that's fine. Remember when Howard Stern ran for the lieutenant governor of New York? Right. You learned that? Yeah, he said he was going to only do construction at night. Right? Yeah, he said he was going to only do construction at night. Oh, holy. It's bad. Don't New York is there for no reason traffic. I mean, the LIE to me, there's no reason. Even tell you, from it's in here to here, it's going to be traffic. For for reason. There can be a fucking guy down the Eastbound Lake. Pull over take a leak. There's fucking traffic. Back to five miles. Because everybody's got to watch this. Cooks like the technical leaks. On the Eastbound Lake. You can't see what's going on in 60 miles. All you must find out is that you got the little. I mean, really come on. Yeah, but you know what my question is. He's going to relance guys. My question. I got a question to you. My question is. Nowadays, you have the GPS. It can tell you where the traffic is. You know exactly how long you're going to be sitting there. You know everything. Is it worse to actually know how bad the traffic is or was it better years ago when you kind of didn't know what you were really in for? That's the question. Well, I'm going to flip phones. I got a fucking flip phone. So I don't know. Let's take out my girlfriend in the car. You know what they do now? Yeah. We launched the drone out of the sunroof. Yeah. People want to know what the hell's going on. It's just the drone out of the sunroof. They go out. This is going to look five miles ahead and they can see what's wrong. And then they bring the drone back into the sunroof. You know, you don't need to do that. It's on your GPS phone. It's on the iPhone. We'll tell you. Yeah, but you can't see. When you got the drone up in the air, you got the screen. I've got the screen. I've got the screen. But my question is, what do you know? My question is, you really want to know. Wait, go. I wish I could talk to that guy and say, what the fuck's going on back? John, do you really want to know how bad it is? So that's the question. Of course you want to know. You want to want to draw enough there and see what it is. I don't want to know how bad it is. I want to know. I want to know if should I get out? Should I walk over there and take a week? Should I? Should I go any minute now? Should I freaking smoke another joint? Wait. I don't know. You can't trust that fucking thing. I've found that out. They showed it red line to purple line to pink line. They when you get up there. It's why open. They save people on the way to the channel. Oh, no. Fucking out right there. Can't get on the way to the fucking going on. Bro, you remember the 70s? Back when it would have an old burned-out car. So like on the side of the road. Fucking human. They didn't even fucking throw that shit out of there. And the 70s. And remember, there would be these demolished cars. You're taking like the eggs that you're on. And there'd be like four of them. How do fuck did they get? They're a whole henry Hudson. They were already spent. They're up on cement blocks. There's no beautiful thing in there. Look at what living in there. They're living in there now. No, no. In back then, they were living in those fucking, or they were like holes of car. You don't need to crawl with gets stolen or get fucking broken down. And all along the fucking west side, I would like to, you know, in the Henry Hudson to be all fucking shells of cars. She's at a side of the road. Holy shit, man. I remember the, yeah, homeless would live in there. But you're driving on the van. Where can you find them on the cross island? You fight. You're driving. Leave them there. They're not. No, it's even the one here. There was on the exit to the Pellon Parkway from, I think, 27 or whatever that road is. And you learn of it. Okay. The big, long sweep in turn, right? And it, and, and it's nothing. Nothing in the middle of that thing. It's grass. Except for one tree. How many fucking cars hit that tree? Like 30 of them. They all hit the fucking trees. I seen them a lot of cycle hit that tree. And the guy was dead. I said, I ran over and I was like, oh, fuck. He's done. Is he real? You've watched. Yeah, that as somebody. You know what I'm talking of. You were always going, yeah, because you're going fast around it. And then you look like a co-op city. Right? Right? Right? You go fast. And then you lose it. And you hit the fucking tree. That's what he's the top. It's nothing. It's abandoned for acres. It's nothing. One fucking tree. Oh, my God. You got to see all the fucking cop cars up here. Oh, shit. So anyway, my brother, I told my brother would happen day by Tell him that story, right? Yeah. And I told him that I called you up and you didn't fucking answer like You was you. And I was going off on your voice man, right? Because I could get on the show because it would happen. So my brother goes, he says, well, he goes, people are really getting to know what you're really about because you are not to show your call day. And you're fucking, who are going not to the phone. That's really you. People don't know it. Oh, they know what they do. But they show. They don't know it. I'm like this all the fucking time. I think we know it Jimmy. You know what's worst though? When it got the fucking protestor standing across the road. And you can't go. You got to go. You got to pick a shit or something. You trying to drive and then his all protests on the road. That's the good. I've heard him. You're going to play the voice, Mel. I probably got it. Let me look at it. Put it in first gear. Go about five miles an hour. Just drive right through them. I don't know if they did like animals. The jiffy. You know, beat your car. I'm trying to break the window. Whatever. If they do that, then you're then you're doing self defense. You're doing it over. He did it to me. When they took me out in Mount Sinah hospital. Stop. Don't call. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. Listen. You hear me out there, like theส helı 好! Bala defame. It's just a Japanese beginning. You fry ur own coat It beats yours yourself. When he ends in sync People- I'll keep your foot here before I stand there where I'm born. You would think I planned on this project. The actor, the stuntman, a father, a wrestler, a man in Terry, and the fact that Rick is not like that. Rick traces the first one to throw a huge group of girls you've learned in the girls you've bought. Throwing out that they don't know that. So today I have a special guest to be and Rick was also a peatie. Yeah, that's like a fun kid. How's that video? Today I have Captain Mary's brain father here. He's a special guest to be a couple of stories. Here he is. Ah, the one, the only top dead of the record is him. Jesus. Dude, I feel like I want you to tell a band video. Yeah, I mean, I'm wasting the band. Oh, that's George. That's not George. That's George. How is that George? In 1726. Take a easy top. He's just like lives music. I was like a, it was like a child of this all. Yeah. Good. So. That's all about your answer. Maybe you have to do this. I opened, I'll be using picking up on that meditation version of this. God, dude, what are we watching at gong show? Yeah, can we got, where's the gong? Did you get me a gong, Tyler? Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Oh, God, baby, it's all right! Fuse, Dave.

And he examples humanity on earth. This is what they want to come and visit. God, they said that they said on the side that the right lane was blocked. The two right lanes on the bad way, right? Those are the signs. So I would have like to as a truck I could over and over. Oh, because it says that the fucking red lanes blocked, right? Look, I get up and it's got something's in the left lane. I got over here because they said the right lane was blocked. I let them be jailed by the left lane. I mean, it all is the same idea. The back was just fucking motherfucking fucking fucking fucking fucking dead. I got that wrong and it's something to hear over there. You better get up on the altar to laugh. That's the fucking train, bro. That's all I'm saying. That's what you need. The funny thing is, I don't, John, I don't know if you heard it in that voice or you're not me, he was like, I'm going around dead bodies here. I'm going to run and dead bodies. Don't push you, Dave, that day. That's what that story I was going to tell you about when I called you. Yeah. My ambe blue, a few days prior to that story. And I called my boss.

I think it's more exciting watching Jimmy, Drunken and Van Wick. Yeah, I would watch that too. All right, so this is where Mr. G got this guy. He goes to the stop and shop. This is the guy in the parking lot who's sitting there. On the side of the road, you'll play in the banjo. And helping people put this there, then grossers away. This is the tower talent pool we have here. He's the parking lot in 13. Yeah, it's good. When I was a kid, I used to play in the pool. I got him. Stop it, stop it. You don't know. Yeah, it's a supermarket. We would have done it. Someone would have gone to the Venice Boardwalk. We could have got some serious talent over there. All right, I got it. Now that's the true. Wait, I could do it. What I was younger, I used to put rubber bands across the fuckers to go up on. And it had more tune in that. Right, put them off. Right, you remember in bed. I got to put the drum circle to remember that. The what's on it going? The drum, the drums, the drummer, the drums. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know, it's the puppy of that shit. It's you. It's like 500 people down. They're all beaten on it. It's in credit sounds like thundering. But that was like a freak show where everybody was trying to get somebody to fucking. Get somebody to fucking get scottle or get discovered. Yep. But you could then you could you could be anybody enjoying it. We're bond those of hunger drum, whatever you can. And then and it's right. It's like here in New York City. I see them play the fucking. I see a play the bucket with the buckets. They've been looking and you have a dude's amazing. Some of that sound. Yeah, yeah, they're good. Venice Beach has great talent. But no, yeah, yeah, yeah, it always did. But that people don't have to discover doing that shit. Yeah, you can't stop and shop parking lot. You're not going to do it very well as you can see. Well, he does pretty well in tips according to Mr. J. Well, you know, Mr. J has a way of exaggerating certain things a little bit. No. I mean, I want to know where to where does this guy live, Mr. J, does he sleep in the parking lot? Over there. I think he's living in Mr. J's. I think he's making cookies and Mr. J now. So you hired him. I think that's what's going to happen. Now, Mr. J's going to come out with a Patreon cookie. Right. But he put that guy on the car and the boy. Yeah, guy. Hey, the guy.

Take a bite. It's a banjo player. You're right. Unbelievable. You're right. Unbelievable. But anyway. Well, what did I want to talk about? What did you want to talk about? I want to talk. It was like. What did I want to talk about? Jimmy, your connection is terrible. Reconnect with us. Keep not come off. A lot of them are freaking out because he sees. We're doing a show. You're breaking up, Jimmy. We have to get rid of the people that don't sound good. Can you just take him from the conference so they can go click back in? All right. I'll reconnect. Why not? They get the link. Oh, because you're like your barym. Oh, yeah. Reconnect. Jimmy, can you reconnect and connect again because your connection is terrible? I don't know. I wanted to talk about it. I might. Dorna's first birthday party was this past weekend. And that was just one year's old year. She we got her water slide. I was going down the water slide. And then I was thinking, you know, back. Do you have you seen that there's a movie out called class? What is it called? It's called class action park. You remember that the place action park we used to go to? Of course. Yeah. And six flags over in Jersey there. The great adventure. I've been in many times. You know, men. I was always afraid to go on a lot of the crazy rides because I was afraid I was going to fall off or kill myself. And everything was like, ah, you're being crazy. Well, evidently, like action park had so many deaths and lawsuits and people getting hurt there that they made a whole movie about this thing. You know, people don't realize these parks are dangerous. You got to be. You know, you could fall off these rides very easily, you know. I was Disney World. One time when my daughters were little and we were on the Mono Rail and there's a point where the Mono Rail was like, where the tracks were two. One going one way and one going the other way really close together. Right. And the guy said last month some kids stuck his head out the window and looking the other way when the other train was coming. You got no way. You're going to be more like, have like glass on those windows or something. You know, you had him had him made it so that they can't open, but somehow that kid got it open. Whatever. Usually I see Puka Rama with their fucking thing where you go in that bucket and spins around like this. And everybody's like, you know, like, your fucking like stuck to the side of the bucket. You know, everybody gets off Guy Bars and hits a guy next to him and shit. Did you ever see that? Yeah, girlfriend goes on right. I don't know how she does it. She goes on a ride. As soon as she gets off your fucking home room, it's just like, why do you bother going on those rides? Well, why would you bother going on a ride that's going to make you fucking, you. It's just fucking nuts. About Fabio, go almost lost the fucking eye. Would have seen go ahead and Mono way and down in a roller coaster. Would he really? Bobby. Bobby, I'll remember Fabio? Yeah, wait. He got hit in Facebook at a single. I'm like a goose sort of fucking duck or some shit like that. Hit him in the eye on the on the on a roller coaster on a way that is all. Oh, remember that was like why was the little bloody in shit? Oh my god. I heard it wasn't a roll of cuts to John. It was actually the van wick expressway. He stuck his head out the window. But that would be impossible because no one no one moves on the van wicks. So you really couldn't get it. I really couldn't get it. I really couldn't get it. I really couldn't get it. I really couldn't get it. I really couldn't get it. You're not a fucker. Get it. Tyler look you can Tyler look that up. Fabio gets hit with his bird and then you know. Yeah, I mean, you get that up on the TV here. You got it. Because that's Fabio you really got it with the romance novel guy with the big chest with fake pecks. Dude, that's like we're dead. That's like we're dead. That's like dead. Am I not dead? Yeah, you sound better now. You sound better now, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sound better. Mr. G is desperately trying to say something. Oh, he found it. Okay. Hold on. Put it up on the screen. He's a little diet rooped it right here. There you go. From great value from Sam's clothes. Is that a rigger? Is that your urine that you you you you you you you you you you a your body. I don't do your job. I don't do your job. Yeah. You're not a quick tricks is on your it the piss isn't it. That's probably a whole lot of everybody running through one more time. All that he's running. He's running. He's showing the Fabio. He's on Fabio thing. Hold on. Oh, you found it. Wait wait. We found Fabio. I don't know if you guys can see it. Okay. They can't see it, but he's running it. I'm right. He's actually on the ride going up the roller coaster. Watching. I'll give you the play by play. You think to actually show it? Yeah. Hold on. Let me see. He's going up up up up up. It must happen. Now they're going down. That's going to wake down. He's got blood all over his face. Like his whole face is all blighted up. His hair is perfect though. He didn't know if he cares about the four fuckers. He's going to burn me. That for him that that much. We're out. Come back to me. We lost these guys. All right. I guess we're going to have to end the show. This is a pretty good show actually. Thanks a lot, dude. Yeah. I guess we have to buy the pro version of those. We're very, very frugal over here in our muscle. It was an experiment on a ride, yes. But, you know, look, the bottom. I wanted to talk about, I wanted to talk about rides, but I guess we're not going to have a chance to. Anyway, we want to send our condolences out to Rick and Jason's family. Of course, I know he did a couple videos on it already, but this was a guy who made a huge impact on our industry. You know, he was he drew the logos for the two most famous gyms in all body building, Golgjim, world gym. He also was in the incredible whole TV show. He was a wrestler. He was an artist. He played instruments. He had a very successful YouTube channel. He edited his own videos. It well into his, you know, 70's. He was 76 years old. So here's a guy who did it all and he lived a great life. And he made a lot of positive impressions on a lot of people. And I don't know if anyone who's ever said a bad word about Rick. So Rick, you'll be missed. We send our prayers out to your family. I'm Dave Palombo for John Romado. Greg Valentino. Jimmy the bull, Palatia. Tyler Shaw, producer. And Mr. G. and I don't know who he had over there. Uncle Sam. Till next week, hanging there and have fun.
