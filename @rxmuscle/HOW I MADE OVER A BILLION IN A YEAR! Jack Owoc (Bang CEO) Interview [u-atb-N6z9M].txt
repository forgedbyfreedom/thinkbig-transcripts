Welcome back to Live With. I'm Dave Palumbo and today I'm super excited because I have the owner and the guy who made it all happen at Bang Energy, Jack O'Wock, a good friend of mine from the past. He's here, he's going to tell us about his tremendous success story in the industry and where he came from, how he got there and where he's going, Jack welcome back to the show. Thank you very much. One of the things I want to do, I'm going to start out with telling people how we met, right? I saw you with the Arnold class of Mark and round and you had a long pants on. What was about bodybuilding pants called the day? And I'm going, I'm looking at you on my booth and I go, who is this free? I can see this rope thing through his long pants. I'm like holy shit and then I found that you were, you had a background of biology and everything like that and then I asked you to write for us, you wrote a few articles in Hall of Magazine, everything but you were a true freak of nature about that. Now you look pretty normal. I forgot that magazine you had that I wrote for you and that was pretty cool. You were cutting edge back and you were always cutting edge now. Definitely. You were, you were cutting edge with the bodybuilders and everything you were doing. And I was always attracted to that scientific part of it because there are so many trainers out there that you're not getting good results and they just double up. Yeah. Double up the nose. Wait, you were in the first interchanged and just double up. And so I admired you because you were probably the first one early on at the I call protocol gurus that took a scientific approach to building muscle. And so that's I think that's how we connected initially. Yeah, you know, I'll tell you where I got from it. I think you were too. Were you a disciple of like a Bill Phillips, you know Scott Connelly Disciple too? Yeah, I followed them with a great deal of interest but people said it Bill Phillips has a seminar you're going to come. I said if he's talking about science, nobody's talking about marketing. I'll pay $5,000 for a front row scene. One of the things that was really cool where we printed the magazine and a ballad where we just talking about and human muscle and performance. It was in this place in Hollywood Florida, little place and they also printed muscle media. So, when I went in there, they printed red book everything because they were the cheapest printer known to man. So, I would go in there and I would get a copy accidentally on purpose of muscle media two months before it was launched because that's you had to print it early to find out where was going on. And Bill was definitely always on the cutting edge. Again, he was, you know, you can follow Joe Weedher this guy or that guy, but I'm like, this guy actually squats. Let's listen to kind of what he said. Bill Phillips was the first guy to really challenge I think Weedher and the whole establishment and say, you know what, I'm not going to like keep this hush hush. We're going to talk about drugs. We're going to talk about what really goes on in bodybuilding and quantify and try to at least put some kind of a scientific approach on it. And I think that guys like me and I'm assuming you as well, we would kind of attract it to that because it was the first time we actually were able to get knowledge because it was no internet back then about these subjects and you know, you got to read the Andeshane and Bill and all the people he would bring in his experts were actually I was able to learn stuff and you couldn't find this information anywhere else. And so to me, he was a guy at least that I wanted to emulate in some sense in the future. I didn't know when I liked the idea he had his own supplement company. I liked the idea that he had a magazine where he kind of educated people on what was the good stuff and what was the crap and you know he would test products and he would put the test results there, who's products were good, who's, you know, he must have destroyed that company and him has strength systems USA. Oh yeah, yeah, they had the worst crap of all time and he exposed them completely, you know. I would remember too in the magazine he would act and at which simply means you just put a black iron over it like a legal documents. But when you held it up to the light, you could actually yeah, yeah, right. Accidentally on purpose because yeah, yeah. But now that was very cutting edge back then. I met Ray on from there, Stony Grimes called me once and we were selling the plus and the base out of this little story. Right. And we took an early position early on with anything that was cutting edge. And the story that I slept on a mattress in, it's kind of like my life story of going from 350 square feet about as big as your office now. Yeah, right now we operate in 3.2 million square feet. That's a thumb belief. But back then, out of that little story here selling so much metrics that they were bringing the pilots in in the beginning of the day and we'd have to sell them before they ended the day because we couldn't even fit it in the store. I didn't really solve that much metrics really. Wow. Yeah. And so that Stony Grimes, this is how I meet Stony because they go Stony Grimes is on the phone. I go for muscle meat. Yeah. He goes look Jack. All the gyms are complaining. You're selling two cheap. He goes but you've been selling it two years before they end. He goes but I got to call you and you got to tell everybody yeah I called you and told you to sell it last year. You keep doing what you're doing. You must have been making them a fortune Jack. Yeah, it was fun though because everybody would come to me early on just like they would come to you. They wanted real information. Right. I'm going to sell them some scams supplement and about then you know about mixture of proteins I still believe in that today the fast and the us way and the slower case in and the intermediate egg protein. I mean it's a great concept. Yeah, I was a good concept. When you saw the I guess the grip that metrics had on our industry where people were paying full retail, no one can plain full retail for metrics. I mean forever for years that's how they made all their money. Is that how you got the idea to say hey you know what I got to start my own supplement line? No it was actually before that for a pivotal story believe it or not I father was over he's 87 years old so I was teaching school when I opened this little store. This little supplement store where I slept in the back on an air mattress. You actually with that was your apartment this store. Yeah it was gone five hours. Vitamins in the front house. And total was seven hundred square feet but I remember one day we were only up at two weeks and I was teaching school and I was making $1900 a month. What's this public school system? This is not probably. In my second week we made $700 now no one's going to be impressed with that nowadays but when you're making $1900 a month and you do $700 one day and you're second week I said there's two of this. Pivot of moment was this guy came in and this is a metric story who's going to buy either the 20 count or the 60 count box remember? Yeah I remember the big I like that big case they had. He's to get I used to get tons of those. Yeah so if he bought the 60 count we we've seen in the huge discount of $144 he could make his car pin. This guy was literally in the store you know pacing back and forth it's only 350 square feet. Deciding his aim if I buy the 20 count I could make my car payment if I buy the 60 I can't make it. My dad was in the store my dad's old school. Yeah so the guy finally gets up there he's got a sleeveless tank on his proud of his build he's sporting about 20% body fat. And he makes the decision after two hours to buy the 60 count he's not going to make his car payment which means it's going to get repossessed. That's something very pivotal though and it's stuck with me and it's so funny that we brought this conversation up yesterday. He said remember son after the guy made a purchase and this world you're measured from the shoulders up meaning that all that bullshit below your your your head your brain doesn't mean not that yeah I think it took you an eye 30 years to learn that. Yeah now you're right you're right very very high but a very pivotal metric story of me realizing like a lot I'm like wait a minute this guy's not going to make his car payment I did 711 day and we had 17 years of uninterrupted growth. Wow but you know that's part of another story so yes. But you know what it tells you that where people's priorities are you know people saw metrics as like it was like you're doing a steroid cycle because there was such a superior supplement to everyone in the marking behind it with bill Philips using Connelly and I mean they had that thing I mean there were like I remember the rumors that there was club uteroll in there people were making up all kinds of crazy stuff because people couldn't believe that you know people were making such games on the stuff and it was just that people were finally eating enough protein and we're eating a protein source that was actually absorbable and able to be assimilated it really was revolutionary in a sense that it created a much higher quality and science based supplement uh business that never really existed before that and then everything kind of took off from there at that point and it was interesting. So everybody's talking about a colleagues, colleagues, surf-up, plus, a colleague deficit. What it did do is you ripped open the package so it was full proof you couldn't fail. Yeah and as long as you're eating high protein look on any diet you know Dr. Antonio did a study where the test subjects consumed 800 calories additional from protein every day about their base and they still build muscle at large spotty fat. So people think like this fan safe and dieting where there's almost no ceiling but if you do that with carbs or carbs and fat you're gonna get body yeah absolutely. Now when when did you decide hey I'm gonna start dpx and and do my own supplements. 1993 we made something called ATP recent the sizeur um it not only had creatinine but it had the different amino acids where your body synthesized creatinine itself and we you know we sold a ton of it. Where did you get that idea for that product yet? What's that? Where did you get the idea for that product? I was kind of looking at a phosphogen and I said well you know it has sugar and even though they were touting that is a delivery system to increase insulin and shuttle you know the creatinine to the muscle and all that there was just too many people like myself that that I believed and I got a lot of it's from you believe in a complicated lot of products. Is that a non-insulin mediated way to build muscle so meaning no sugar no harm. Yeah and once when I came out with shotgun and there's you know we have muscle gene protein studies where it increases myogenic regulatory factors up to 550% uh new to genomics proven in a Baylor university study in the Florida state study that's all in my book that's coming out okay that Natalia if you can in what year was that jack that was before you were ahead of your time I think at that point I was a legend in my own month. No what year did you come out that that no one was talking about that stuff when you came no even knew you were talking about when you came out with that stuff. Yeah and one of the things when you say that and I'll answer your question the second is that that's why I came out with the magazines I said look you know I was a teacher a science teacher a bunch of different disciplines there's a look if you come out with something new you got to take on the responsibility of educating you just like you did a body building a training protocol and everything like that I mean you can't come out with something new then you got to actually sell the truth during the consumer he's gonna use products now when the when the pro hormone market kind of got really ripe for the ticking and you know I think Patrick Arnold was the first person to really introduce the interesting guy on and then everyone kind of jumped on the bear like you actually had a great spin on it because you had that you had your pro hormones and you were selling with the little syringe you know attached to the bottle which was great for it was only like a baby syringe like that you would drop like a kid's medicine with where to get that idea that was brilliant jack so one of the things I had a little boy at the time and I noticed like in public it's like a croaker people on familiar publics and different parts of the country but they are right just like you said they would feed babies with these little things that look like a syringe but they had no needle right and back so was a company that had maygos and packed with them and the patent was very simple you couldn't screw a needle on because in the hospital setting if somebody saw this thing and screwed an needle on and injected food into someone obviously you're gonna have a pretty right drop and so I got the idea that when you study bodybuilding heroin addicts anybody that's into this type of stuff even supplements there is much addicted to the ritual as they are the drug and sick you're right you're right so we had this bottle and you would stick thing in this syringe and pull ups I down but that was that was kind of a marketing thing but it was a great tool to measure how much you use because if you're using something like a product we had called monster tests 10 milligrams in a and a liposomal delivery system and a limited it was super punk so you had to measure it I mean the difference between 10 milligrams and 15 can right send somebody over the edge so these like that not for one death so but what we learned first which was really cool as I said and you know the name of the the parent name of the company still vital pharmaceuticals yeah I said look this supplements like bill tested we tested everything fake nothing meets label claim I don't want that snake oil image I want to operate like a pharmaceutical company so all the original drug hormones if you remember they weren't poorly acted they would break down with first task liver degradation just like you know real steroids so I said look I want to make something that's just like an injection that five passes first bypass liver degradation was directly into the bloodstream was pretty easy in science is when you code something with a lipid the lipid will transverse the intestinal through the micro directly into the bloodstream because it's light and philic and we got stuff like four understand a dial in the early 12 hormones to work magnificent people were gaining seven to 10 pounds I had a doctor dime and up in your neck of the woods in New York testing these on all this clients and given the blood results and it was phenomenal yeah well the games we can get the thing and then nobody can compete with us right because if no one had that no one had that delivery yeah just didn't work interesting so you make and then obviously they make the stuff illegal at some point you can't sell anymore was that yeah you recreate yourself so many times that I'm that's really what impresses me what do you do you make in a lot of money selling these pro hormones obviously in addition to the other stuff you're making with the company but that's you I'm sure you make a ton of money from that how do you say these up oh my god I can't sell this stuff anymore I got it now recreate my brand to to to to a champion something else what did you do at that point how did you respond to that new law that they said for it well it's interesting that you say that because everybody said oh VPX is gonna go out of business and to a little bit of everything like that but one of the things I was always doing that you've got to look you have to embrace change you have to be different and you have to just like we did now we took everybody off guard we came out with a carbonated drink I've let it say no one would drink it we did all these things seven years ago the people were just copying us now so you're too late and again you look at every supplement company now they have a excuse me it's been out carbonated drink this is the new key lime pie that we just launched amazing I have to say that bang or red line which what brand is that well that's it's it's bang okay but that's the thing just like with the pro hormones is I knew we had to pivot right I knew we had to pivot when a Fedor was going to be made illegal we would we would be experimenting every day all day all night with different stimulants and it was another pivotal point when when a Fedor was pulled everybody just took it out of the product well none of the products worked yeah you can be and these other methylated P.E.A. compounds and everything that was legal at the time and we were ready when we answered and it was really cool because GNC we had a love eight relationship but we red line came into prominence they would buy our red line gel caps they would purchase when a Fedor was made illegal $1.7 million per juicer in the beginning of month and like a 700,000 but that didn't for a little company man I was blown away but we had the only answer and then we transitioned that into the red line drink and it became the number one selling beverage and all categories of all time and both GNC and Biden and shop where the love of this world helps world's largest health feed retail let me ask you that because that you know that was definitely a monumental very unique thing that you did you came out with it it was an energy shot drink red line no one had that people don't realize you would first to market with that where did you get the idea from to do that jacket and what gave you the you know drinks are heavy to ship they obviously increased the cost you have to have distribution like when you got this idea to do this I mean did you know how you were going to get there or kind of did you feel your way thank god I was stupid you know I was in the beginning new anything but when you you have this gut feeling something's going to work you don't worry you're not sophisticated like we are now we're thinking about shaking away we're like we're all in for it okay yeah so yeah yeah I'm not delus yeah were you making the original ones yourself a did in house or were you farming it out initially no so what what we did was we took this position and I believe we still have this position to that well explain it is to become the kings of liquid delivery because everyone is doing everyone else wasn't doing it everyone was afraid of it I embraced the science early on and so we were learning again now and funny you just bring up that little applicator it's like a bottom of the screen but it's five MLs right so you have 334 milligrams of a federal herb in there you had your hand the you had 250 milligrams of caffeine all in five cc we had to learn out of flavor that so yeah right so when you learn out of flavor that it comes to okay now we have eight ounces it's so much easier we were experts your experts in liquid delivery and what we did too and we still do this there we have this high speed shear and it's this blade system that you got to see it's just phenomenal and it takes particle weight down to three microns or less and so you're you're sharing these compounds where you're getting a much greater effect out of the sememannocompat it's just like there's bad to a two if you look at the vaccines that are made now these people go well how could they effy what well they're they're the aluminum that's in there why would you put aluminum is micronized to such a degree and so is the mercury that across is the blood brain barrier so we took that negative though and made it into a positive or you micronized these particles and they're much more effective so red mind everybody's like how is this drink clear and it takes taste so good and works so well but again we are like obsessed with all these liquid delivery systems to make the problem on work right this understood how did you did you have like like scientists working for you to do this to figure this stuff out or how did you um how did you come yeah because no one did it before and you were the first ones to really you know revolutionize that how does that come about how do you we didn't even start with something like that so I you know I taught six different disciplines of science took chemistry and did all this thing and had enough knowledge where I could figure most of this stuff out to a certain degree and then handed off to one of the guys we had was from a major pharmaceutical company and his title was head of liquid liquids and semi solids and so we worked with him to do these different delivery systems and I can articulate what I wanted and him and I work and together we would be able to we would be able to make these different delivery systems to get the things work so I was always considered myself the world expert on these unique ingredients and then take them and take maybe an ingredient that was you know orally maybe mediocre I turned it into the super ingredient who are great delivery system the reason I really admire what you did jack is because you didn't just like you're not just a marketing like genius guy who said hey I got an idea I'm going to make an energy drink and and and compete against some of the you know red bull and all these other guys you act you actually had science behind your product and I don't even know people who use your product know that aspect of what you do that that there's actually a science behind you're everything you make over there because that to me that only validates what you're doing more because most of these you know carbonated drinks out there just caffeine and carbonation and flavor I mean you you you have a layer of something more they are with is actually science behind what you're doing yes so one of the things I did too is um everybody was telling us when we had red line drink you'd have a top executive from Pepsi from Dr. Pepper as they would get fired they would they would always gravitate toward us and they would get three and they would say look over and over you got to come out with a carbonated 16 hours got to come out over and over but they also would tell me but make sure you put sugar oh no way because their thing was hey the ones that are top sellers I'm sugar in it right so what I learned early on was and we could get back to this I don't know how long you want to do this interview but to deny the data to be super successful you have to deny the data because that means your isolize protein if you look at the data great in orange or number one you'd have a great in orange but you see all these revolutionary flavors because you denied the data and like we have rainbow unicorn uh that radical skidado all these crazy flavors that are top sellers because we denied the data and made and did things differently so here's a shameless plug for my book but I'm gonna put it up close because one of the key things like you said is it has over a thousand scientific references that's crazy seven patents and 30 university studies that we did so in there I was always interested in the science so we would fund studies a bailiff or to state UCLA Memphis all these great studies that's part of the book that makes it different right I told my wife I've been writing this book for 13 years so I said I could throw this book in the garbage right now and I felt like it many times this is just a part of the time yeah we did we did one point two a billion in sales last year but that's from this massive learning it's hard hard yeah say that number again what you didn't sell I'm gonna quote iRI dad because a lot of people will never believe it so you could look it up it's public information we did uh we're just bang we did one point two a billion in sales in 2000. Billion with a B. Yes wow that is impressive Jack that's going to appreciate that congratulations man thank you very much thank you and so but but writing that book that 13 years of discipline and effort to write the book is what set us on that track because what happens is is then it allows us to set the trend us to know where it's going right to know what the next innovation is going to be and everything based on the science right go ahead now what I wanted to ask you was I I know this I I have never discussed it with you but I know that with the answers going to be ready when you start to do in these kind of sales I have to imagine that Pepsi and Coke read all these companies that are the big names they gotta be shaking in their boots they gotta be like really angry to that this guy who's who's sleeping in his in his store 10 years ago is it is now cut into their business when you get in like I mean the people give you death threats or do we there people like you know trying to like muscle you out of the business try to put the kabach on you well give me one second here you could go to someone I'll do I'll let my scientists leave now because he's he has a other side waiting for us to the truck because research and development we never stop at no matter what yeah I'll just I'll just check you later thank you kindly we we got to tell the samples that he brings over every day and twice a day and then I get stemmed out of my business and you must be jacked out of your mind over time a little bit the samples here yeah I'm trying to sip this while we talk yeah so yeah that's why I asked you if you're sure you want to go down that rabbit hole there's some negativity there on glad the shock about it yeah I like to know because people think that it was it was an easy rise for you but I have you know these companies they don't go they don't go softly into that good night they they're not going to just like bow down to you so I have to imagine it was it was a very tough road for you yeah okay so and and you're correct so I always equated especially being down here in Miami you know the scarf a few days and everything else the drug dealing trade um when Castro let all the criminals out of jail that really did happen Scarface down here and then Florida when Castro let all the the Cuban prisoners got right but you know a drug deal and someone takes your turf right and you what do you do you kill in the corporate world you sue them and you try to put them out of business well in 2008 roughly uh I don't know roughly about 10 years ago both Red Bull and Monster suit us over Redline knowing that this product was far superior than anything they had right they were in panic muck um and they both suit us they were both frivolous lawsuits both of them had to walk away with nothing um but it was interesting so you beat you beat them you beat Redline and Red Bull I mean you beat Red Bull in Monster right and so what happened in the Red Bull case is we both had spent 700 grand on attorney speech uh he decryptation out of Austria sounds just like Arnold when you talked in the attorneys over there and everything he said look we got to sell this lost not the york but his main attorney folk or Vic power never ever get his name any goes he goes we spent 700 grand almost to do spend we're now like frenemies right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I go we spent 700 too we spent the same amount he goes we he goes I'm gonna tell you the truth he goes we made people go wait for 15 grand and he goes apparently you ain't going to wet they don't know they didn't know you very well jacked that's right oh what happened with Redline is we made it first in an aluminum cannon we did make it in house to answer your question because we don't want to pick up what the formula my first one was 80,000 bombers second run just six weeks later it was 800,000 bombers how did you have enough and the production and what you were running blind 24 hours a day well we bought this killer fog filler it's from it's it's a rotary filler that does a few hundred bottles a minute yeah that was fast for us back then funeral bottles a minute and we purchased it and we were just you know we were running it nonstop and you know you know we're all jacked up on clip, but Redline said there was times we'd work on the magazine for 48 hours straight and think nothing of it you know you're having fun and yeah and so we had the I said okay the attorneys I realized that it was the law firm that was the problem hot red right because then they said an underground and I told him in 21 emails do not only one person's allowed to bill and I said we're gonna win this in the media and I'm gonna teach you guys how to fight this the right way against rambles so in any event we didn't look to the attorneys talk and Volker and I settled the case within 10 minutes really he wanted to save face and so Redline had originally had a gray cat right and we were changing to white cat because it was one penny cheaper and it looked a lot cleaner right and a pack when you're starting to make millions of bottles which we phased into after the second run this a lot of you know adds up to a lot of money yeah so so he went back and he was able to tell his folks well we got him they were saying that little cat like this cat right here yeah we copied without a silver plastic lid I mean come on they were going to die are you serious well they knew they lost so in when we went before the judge and and mediation I said a bunch of things the judge was making fun of me for like six hours straight real why don't you think of fun of you because that's what you know judges do I was saying all kinds of things that he just didn't agree with you are trying to do a settlement so I said judge Rolex so now I'm getting to be a little smart ass too I go judge because we're like you know we're taking shots at each other yeah we're bored I mean they're we're in the red bowl they're double billing on their blackberries yeah sure I said Rolex watch I'm which is a fake one costs because I don't know if you're in a box I go what's the real one costs and to the judge could relate to a Rolex right he's at ten thousand dollars right I said well I don't know if you know there's the red bowl's claiming that we're the knock off and do you know that we cost a dollar more than it and he goes he goes oh look it's the first intelligent thing you said all day but he agreed with me and red bowl attorneys literally scrambled out in the hallway to settle out for that because they knew they were sunk in other words you cannot claim that red line is a knock off when it would have cost 30% more than you'd be right right right right right right right and I I'd say furthermore judge because the laws it's called confusion and don't want consumer confusion right because this is the only case that's so agreed just that you go blindfold consumers and put all the energy drinks out there and go field on one that's different and then would pick red line because it's the only one that's not the matter can't right and they knew that we're sunk and so we went out into the hallway didn't let the attorneys talk and we settled literally within 15 minutes but I could have went against some of God attorneys fees and everything like that but you know back then you know when you already spent seven hundred grand and you're spending so much money and it's meant that people don't understand this lawsuits you're meant to take you off your game sure so when when you when you you get taken out of the equation because you got into deposition's not this it hurts the business a lot and I just wanted to get back to business so I'm glad monster also suit us same year because they were again in panic mode because in LA we were just crushing at which is the most progressive and sought after energy drink market in the world right so in the monster case a similar thing happened I had to go out there for mediation I told the judge I go on the phone run a conference call rotten Rodney Sax I call my game the hashtag rock rock and all their people and I just posted several about this yesterday I'm linked in that you can read about rotten Rodney but the judge said I said judge I don't want to go out there Rodney all excuse me Mark all Rodney Sax they're arrogant I'll never settle I said I want to just go straight to court I didn't want to fly out there in any of the Asia because I knew they would never come to a settlement and I said you know you're on or they never beat people they just sued them and they run them out of money and they ruin them financially and emotionally and so he said we'll keep talking Mr. Aug so I said look you could look it up they're one of the most nutritious companies in America right now I believe they're the most litigious consumer product good company in America with over 250 federal lawsuits wow and the new growing people's lives many people have come to me so I said I go the bully needs to get struck back right and he goes what about your shareholders said the company's privately owned he was what about your legal fees I said we have the amounts of attorneys for this exact same thing I want to fight these guys he goes Mr. Aug remember this is like 10 or 11 years ago he goes I agree with you the bully needs to get struck back words are very powerful and you're the one to do it wow these words are come true today where we're in the lawsuit with them where we're like six different lawsuits with them and we're not we're doing it on behalf of ourselves of course good for everybody else based on principle if they ruined their lives sexual harassment suits everything they they got caught rig in the arbitration I posted something yesterday where they where they lied about to their shareholders where they just followed a suit yesterday and asked and so those judges words are coming true is the bully needs to get struck back and where they want to do it here it is 11 years later we're doing it we have six cases and I told my attorneys I go I don't know can't have hot to spend a hundred million we're going to take these guys out I said this under oath several times I go no holds bar and so we're in this fight right now but when you take a billion dollars away from somebody in sales just like a drug dealer they're not going to sit down and fight for their turf and that's the question you ask it's a long extended answer but you're not just going to sit back they're in panic mode because they know bags of better products a cleaner product the young people are embracing and we have this extreme positivity they have this extreme negativity and they just can't compete and that's a good job but Jack how do you balance how do you stay balanced yourself because that lawsuit is stressful no one wants to be sued no one wants to deal with this just crap you want to you're a science guy you want to just do your science and and and make your products I know I know the kind of person you know what how does that affect you mentally or have you learned to kind of like separate yourself from it? No I learned how to bifurcate the two different things I think it's to me it's difficult I don't force my religion on anybody but it's real simple in the Bible there's a historical count of this too even if you're not religious well the David Goliath fight it's a real fight it's historical it's religious implication also but in life you're going to face a lot of giants I know you I don't know your story exactly but you're not going to get to where you're going without resistance it just doesn't happen right God puts these at giants in your way God put Goliath and David's path for David to come into prominence and us to be talking about him right now today he had to slay the giant you don't ram the giant can't circumvent him you can't go over him you got to slam in order to come to your desk and I've had a strong belief on that so God put this giant in our way and the bigger the giant Dave the greater the reward is on the other side so I know when we slay this giant to me it's like a demonic thing on the other side is this massive victory right the bigger the giant the bigger the victory you got to slam so you're a warrior you've competed you you know all these fans in order to win you got to do what you got to do you can't counter and fear like a lot of people are doing during COVID I used this being principle last week we're out Texas for four week 221 people hey COVID's here we did it safely we're launching work once strong I'm teaching people look if you you can't counter and fear in your battle you got to go out slayer giant what it did was it made everybody happy positive they got out did something and and stopped you know hiding in their apartment. Sure well you know what you did is what you're doing I is is unbelievable you know that just recently you guys signed that big huge deal with Pepsi how does that come how does Pepsi come to you say you we want to be your official distributor that that's enormous enormous and big deal that you signed with them and and yet you still have complete ownership of your company it's amazing yeah so we in as we bush did well for us and we still use probably about 80% of our former and as we're bush to strip distribution with our ally brands we have something called new fusion really cool because it's got 10,000 50 milligrams of active it's got seven grams of essential amino acids really cutting that stuff it's hard to synthesize 10 grams in a 16 ounce beverage carbonated no one else can do it to date we we we read red line which has been huge I saw that I like those new red lines they try to they're really good too. Thank you flavors of delicious. I mean a lot coming from you so so what these products though they're we call an ally brands we're still distributing them with our own distribution and with a lot of anti-subush houses and even certain independent Pepsi's Pepsi has an exclusive distribution deal for a bat right yeah you know it takes a lot of getting used to because we're super fast we launch a new fan flavor every 90 days wow they're a very slow shift to turn there's a great dynamic tension there both companies are learning from each other but like in food service they're massive like on 60% of all college campuses it's just mine wow yeah what they what they have to offer you they have 350,000 pounds but again they you know they we we make unilateral decisions and and quick decisions and what them it's slow it's just there's a lot of dynamic tension where we're learning from them and they're learning from them it's definitely not easy that's true though let me ask you this is the question I want to ask you because you're a humble guy I know you're from many years I mean you lived in your store very modest you now you have probably more money than you can ever spend in your entire life and I know you not a big extravagant guy you know you're not a show off you know you like your little toys but you know what when you have that much money when you make this much money you're this successful what do you do with the money what point does it become like you know I don't even care about the money anymore because you work just as hard today probably maybe harder than you did when you were living in your store it's amazing to me it was never about the money it was about winning a game and helping people and even in my first year in business I told the people that were starting to work for me I go look just help people just help people the bank account take care of itself I said they looked at me like a deer in the head I said go imagine if you helped 100 people today how much sales we would do and it ran clear to that was like look if I talked to somebody on the phone explain the supplements and help them and get that them get what they want hey the bank account will take care and we still have that same mentality now you might think I'm odd for God or people that don't understand religion I don't force it again on anybody I'm just who I am but I look at my blessings as a way to bless others and to advance the kingdom of God here on earth you know very simple it is you look right now and it's 21% more people are seeking God because of a craziness going on the world it's unfortunate most people put God on the shelf that went there abandoned well they go God we need to pull you down we need to talk I'm scared but a lot of people are missing God in their life and it's the spiritual dynamic even time magazine it's very secular said that we scientifically were wired for a relationship with our creator and I think too many people are trying to fill that God void that they have with sex drugs everything else and you can't fill it you can only fill it with God and just I met a lot of super Uber wealthy people especially in my position now and I noticed a lot of them no matter how success well wealthy folks, jets whatever when I don't have God they're very shallow and insecure it's it's it's mind blowing and so I think it's a dynamic that everybody should explore again I'm not out for what I'd send just like the rest of them but you live your life in a different manner I mean I get my joy now I have four kids with my new wife and five kids total and that's you know what brings me joy and I like work and I like doing what you do if someone came to you Jack and said hey you know what we're offering a couple seats on this next space flight to the moon it's got a cost you whatever million dollars two million dollars would you go to the moon I would send you all right no I'd be bored stuff you never know you could you you might find some new new ingredients supplement ingredients over there. I must get some arms they're going to burn up what's it? I don't know lately they said there might be life on Venus they found a lot of different things that indicate their might be life I mean uh who knows but I think it would be crazy to be in space and trapped uh bring it one with me because I probably have to shoot this. That would tell you some reagent Jack what what's what's the next big project what where where do you see your company going in five years from now. Well wait I got asked you first would you go in the space but if I would if I didn't have kids probably so I'd say no now because I would be afraid that I wouldn't come back but if I didn't have kids I'd probably do it yeah. Do you consider John Romano you can't yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I might go John wait if I can go a John and have like at least someone talked to the whole time I probably go yeah I'm gonna pay for both of you to go. I'm always a question guy. All right I'll pick you out if you pay for me I'll go. I love my producer says he to help come to you. Bye I spoke too sweet. Let me ask this question seriously I mean you see yourself continuing to do this you know for 10 15 20 more years you'd like if someone came along and it offered you a ridiculous amount of money for your companies would you sell? Well that's happened twice I mean in my house now I invited you over but you never came. But we've had an eyes for bushover contemplating buying a piece of the company and I told them I would sell them am I near by Nordie Cheryl only I said look you can't have anybody sit on the board I go with fat you're not even allowed to call me I thought they would be upset and they go oh we messed up our business and we'd really mess up years so they go don't worry we won't be calling that never materialized because they're losing 4% a year and when you're losing 4% of a 100 billion it sales every year that kind of hurts oh yeah 10 to 12 years but um the problem is here unless you're going to hire me I'm unemployed so if I slow the business it's quite when I work I tell them same it's like you're you're unemployed well John Ramon is I and then what who's going to hire us but you don't need to work to I can yourself a business you can go you can go off into space if you want to me it doesn't matter you can do whatever you want I mean would you I'd you see yourself wanting to retire at some point and cash out? Not necessarily I just like win in the game and I don't think about that right now but this just happened fine I'm trying to revolutionize things do things radically different than everybody else has done I'm and you would think that these big beverage giants know what they're doing and have everything under control but they they don't they're very dysfunctional and everything like that and so we're working on changing that right now we're putting a few hundred million dollars into our distribution and manufacturing right in the Phoenix whenever you want to go we have the fastest beverage lines in America running 3600 bottles a minute and wow so we just bought a a 654 thousand square foot plant in Georgia where we're going to put the fastest line in the world it's never been tested before but it's 4200 cans a minute oh my god what what have you buy down in that flar I know you just bought something recently there's a big article about it you bought a huge place yes so we bought sixty acres and and on the front end of the sixty acres there's going to be three buildings the first two buildings are once 2205 thousand square feet once 250 and the third one we're going to connect in the second one just then make a massive building and so we'll add a major plants all throughout the United States wow print print in the cans it's called a candacorator right it's 60 million dollars and 80 million dollars doing stall it's mind blowing oh my god filling them all in the same plant that's going to ship in the men and doing things wrong the way the rest of the beverage industry does it wow they're super excited about that I'm excited about aluminum because it's infinitely recyclable you can just cycle a 22 times for a plastic a yellow plastic bottle you cannot recycle it once into another bottle you can make carpet out with the second down but I'm a fisherman just too much plastic in the ocean yeah yeah just being responsible and having fun doing it Jack you're an amazing story I've been lucky enough to have been friends that you're over the years and I've seen you grow and you've seen me do you my thing and so it's nice to have a success story at the end of the rainbow and you know you're fighting the good fight and I like the fact you still got the fire and you got to keep going and I'm enjoying watching your journey because it is it is cool to say hey I knew this guy when he lived in his store and now he's fighting you know these major uh drink distributors and winning and at the end of the day it's a lot of the good guys to come out on top yes and I want to tell you you're listening or something really important that I've always looked up to you your scientific knowledge your ability to train to do people's diets to do people's programs your your lot of supplementation everything you I want you to know I look up to I have the utmost respect for you always have and that's why we've always been friends for all this time I appreciate it and I appreciate our relationship and if you ever need anything and I mean that's sincerely just let me know you never have to buy dang again for the rest of your time I'll tell my wife that so like that the sanity of free but keep doing what you're doing you're doing a great job and and I also applaud you doing what we did is you pivot it right you you kept changing what the punches were a lot of people in this industry didn't last that long there was no longevity it couldn't reinvent themselves like you have done you know half a dozen times and I applaud you for that you're listening or she'd really appreciate that thank you very jack that means a lot to me I appreciate that compliment and best to luck in the future and we'll keep and touch obviously and you'll you'll give us updates on the latest products that you got coming out with and I know our viewers love that type of stuff and I have one final message yes God bless you and the horse you wrote in thank you thank you I also have a jack thank you so much and guys that's going to take us to the end of another episode of live with on day polimbo for jack O'awwock we'll see you next time
