You're the only one who doesn't care If you look inside of us, you'll have to be with all what you've for There's a chance, never If you reach into the sun And the soul wins you love We're not away And many people come to love We're just waiting to be with you And you'll have to be with us And you know you can't stop So finally feel like going away Looking so much on the road And if I'm still in the blue I hear a thousand blue Yes, yes, yes, yes Yes, yes, yes Yes, we'll hold on When we just say Oh, you'll hold on You'll have to fall, alone I'm feeling the same You're welcome To both of them You're just so big And then you will come to long When the storms go down Here we are And the cast will be to the sky And the answer will go You can't say You're so warm in the morning You're so strong You're so big You're so strong You're so big
