哎嚅哨沉只要cent 所以說香港瞭報因為中國性會超過12星以上 legend我是其他的粉絲好!好! welcome back to RX Muscle Supplement and Science! Today we're going to be here with two special guests Am I good friends? John and Sharesas Horace from Titan Medical Center.com and we're going to be talking about immune system and this is a very important subject to obviously given the fact that we are in these COVID times and people are getting sick and you know what? I thought who better to bring in here than someone who has had personal experience unfortunately with this COVID virus, Sharesas you have gone through a hell of a last couple of months you want to first of all welcome guys to the show! Thank you! Thank you for having us! We love to be part of this show! Well, the good thing about what you went through is that I always believe in my life. I always say, why did I have to go through this? Why did this weird thing happen to me? And you know what? I believe things happen for reason. I believe that a lot of things happen in my life because I am been put here to help educate other people and how to navigate their way through some of the things that I have gone through. You guys obviously are in the business of health and wellness and you know, hormone replacement and immune system, fortification and you know who better to be able to advise people and that then someone has actually gone through this whole COVID trauma. You had a horrible experience but you know you've come through it and a lot of it has to do with some of these supplements that you were taken to help you bolster your immune system and get you through this. So I think it's... Thank goodness! Give us the whole... Had you first find out you had COVID? Well, I'll sum it up for you. So you know obviously you know that I work you know like 24 hours a day so rain or shine. She works a half hour and one can I do every day which is 23 to half hours. She works 24. 23 to half. You know so it doesn't matter. I've always pushed through everything. So I started getting sick one day you know it was back in June and I started getting a little sniffles cough you know maybe a little sore throat whatever. Long story short. I'm like I had John I'm not feeling too good. So day by day went by I want to say about a week went by and we did have a couple positive COVID cases come into our clinic when they wanted to get tested. What what what? They can June. Okay. Yep this was in June. So you know they came in and they honestly they got tested. They were positive and you know they wanted to get IV treatment that had glutathione vitamin C and zinc in it. That was like B thing to do to try to boost the immune system. So anyways I wasn't feeling good and I'm like hey listen you know maybe we should maybe I should swab and see what's going on. Right. So I did I swabbed and you can just can't just you can test in your clinic right? Yes. Yep we did the nasal swab. So you know I didn't I didn't the nasal swab sent it out you know you know you know and obviously now this this was an absolute nightmare Dave okay and I'll tell you why it was a nightmare. So I fended out and obviously I have all my staff here and they're all waiting for this result too because now I got you know all these other people in the office with the sniffles and are running knows and now everybody with allergies has COVID so you know it's like oh what's going on so I get the result back and I get the result and it's negative and I'm like okay well you know this is this is fine I'm just sick right. That's when I started feeling this is where I started feeling kind of weird so but a few days after that and it progressed pretty quick um we have a two story house so I'm going up and down the stairs to just grab things whatever normal things and I can't breathe and I like told John I'm like I can't breathe when I'm walking up and down the stairs like like I literally can't breathe and you know as day I was just standing there and I just I felt like it wasn't a pass out it wasn't good like it was really scary like you could get it up on getting into your lungs almost no no no it like and it honestly it stayed that way for probably it solid like 40 days like 40 days where I had to like wake up and you know I don't cry because my baby but you know literally it may be cry because I'm you know I just I didn't know it got to a point where I didn't know what was going to happen so moving on you know I I get this negative COVID test and I'm like I feel weird something's wrong you know you know your body so you know something is wrong um so I get a chest X right chest X right comes back I had pneumonia all right cool so I got pneumonia that's cool I could ride this out right I can't get a body take some antibiotics I'm good right I got a little inhaler I mean thank goodness we have access to everything doctor IV you know I went through the whole ring right X way that service year so it was like boom boom bam right okay so couple days later I'm like John I can't even drive like I literally can't drive you're on the track that's not getting better is it been essentially what happened I was on so at this point um the we went ahead of the game and the doctor's like listen if you can't breathe you can't see this isn't that this is what happened I started um gaba peintin because I started getting pain and I couldn't see it was dizzy and so gaba peintin was helping with the nervous system um I also started dexamethasone and I was helping with the inflammation obviously because I couldn't breathe it was a steroid um I also did an inhaler and I was on antibiotics I was on augmentant um unlike John I'm swapping again and I'm swapping you while we're at it right so swapswap boom three days later positive I'm like golf both of you both of you both yeah and you know I was totally asymptomatic wow crazy you know it was like what was it? I was in a question with the question I had pneumonia you think that you got it worse? No I think that the COVID caused the pneumonia I think the pneumonia COVID go together the 100% a hundred percent because I mean I've had pneumonia before and I never felt like that where I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see um I mean even looking at the clock it was like double digits and that's scary because I can't fix it so I'm like you know this is not good let me sit down I need to work you know and it's just getting to a plenary can't work so obviously everybody in the office freaks out you know we had to test everybody for COVID thank goodness I would say what we have 12 employees two came back positive um we had to sterilize the whole office everybody's working remotely people are hotels me and John are not a kid's positive we're not always him living out of like dying on my deathbed how is on this how you how was the children don't see to have any symptoms right you was fine yeah Peter's fine and the crazy thing about it Dave is that my dad we retired my dad for years we lived in my house yeah right it does nothing but stays in the house he's high risk kidney disease heart disease so at that point like we were scared he was gonna catch it because we had it my son had it with death sentence for him yeah you can't get him but he did right we swapped them twice totally negative I'm holding those symptoms so we're like thank God wow yeah so um this is where I took a little deep turn so I told John every day that went by and I'm on this nebulizer holding it up to my mouth you know trying to breathe um because it literally felt like I was trying to breathe through a straw I've been that's the best way I can explain it just a straw here and try your best to breathe um that's where I started getting legs swelling and listen I'm on decks of methods I'm on everything so it's like what else am I gonna take to get better um started swelling up you know my stomach started swelling up I look like I was pregnant until John I'm like you know I don't want to go to the hospital I don't want to go to the hospital I'm not going I'm not going because I know you don't leave well no you don't I'm like they're gonna kill me there they mean they don't leave they they they they they you know exactly they're gonna kill me I don't want to go there you know so and not only that but in the hospital when you're over 18 they make you save by yourself so you don't have anybody there to support you you're a buyer self so anyways we go to the dons of our favorite place to hang out um by the pool you know in John's like get some sun I'm like literally dying so I'm like whatever just I'll take sun whatever I've been these good at all yeah um so next morning I wake up and literally crying so the point like just I couldn't walk so my knees for whatever reason it was a sepsis but the knees locked up um and I couldn't walk so at that point what else are you gonna do you gotta go the hospital right so John's carrying me out of the so it's hell and um takes me to the ER well first we can't I'm not gonna lie first we can't take this office we ran stat labs here because I didn't want to go I Dave I wasn't going you could run actually last one year office I didn't realize that wow cool yep right here we drew the blood I called one of my nurse practitioners I'm like hey I need you it's and Dave this is for the July oh my god I'm for the July on for the July you know I'm like I'm lucky to have the staff so anyways I'm like come in I need you draw my blood hurry up so we run the stat labs like if there's old back in two hours and my white blood cell count is at like an 18 which it shouldn't be over like a 10 so that point this is not good once the ER they ran all the labs you're not leaving you're staying because you have sepsis um they also diagnosed me with the elius or you I think that's what it's called where your um gastrotrack stops moving so that's why my stomach is all like that yeah yep that's why I blew up like that so I'm a hospital nothing yeah the only thing they gave me was you know obviously they had to start up like three IVs on me and gave me all these different antibiotics that push of antibiotics um my you know lactic acid was was super super super high she had lactic acid acid acid acid lactic acid toases yeah so basically like what the best way to make you like make you as understand because a lot of you guys out there work out right um so if you got the best personal trainer on the planet and they worked you to death every single portion of your body that's what it felt like two days later like I couldn't even lift my arm because it hurt that bad that why you could just work to because you're you're so much like yeah I could walk as my legs were my legs were swollen um I you know it's just literally I was just I couldn't do anything how long ago you've therefore before you started feeling better well so here's what happened um obviously you know I've been in nursing for a while so I'm very familiar with what will and will not kill me um so I'm in the room with the special air and everything and they don't have any more COVID rooms right so I'm there for two days and you know there's patients that are older patients that need that room um and I just told them I'm like less than I'm like I'll be fine I only you know medical clinic I'm good you know just discharge me because I don't want to be here anyway I mean think about being on fourth of July I'm in the you know this ICU room by myself being treated like literally being treated like an alien because you know everybody's coming in in a bubble suit nobody wants to be near you because they're scared of you yeah John couldn't you know oh did you get in there? no no I was by myself like and I'm hearing the fireworks gone outside you know and I'm like I'm drawn on FaceTime like an crying and like this is so bad I'm like so finally after I have the phone I was like hey go I hit the button the nurse button I'm like hey I don't know what you have back there but whatever you got put in my IV I'm going to sleep like I just want this night to be perfect I'm done so um the you know I want to say like this this breathing issue slash stomach issue slash pain that I couldn't stand up straight pry lasted a solid like two or three weeks like you're in the hospital three weeks no no so I was I was out of there I'm like I'm out of here give the room to someone else and I just was basically bedridden for well you should say why see you might be at home at least you could have like John that fear yeah I mean I have I have access to everything so you know I'll just keep a close eye on it but I mean even when I left the hospital I still I ended up going back to the hospital again like what was it a week later because with COVID there's blood clots you know I want to say what fit like 50 or 60% of patients with blood clots so they have me taking a baby astronaut to make sure I don't get a blood clot and then you know it's just it's frustrating day because nobody is every doctor that came in that room because they gave me pulmonologist they made cardiologists and internal medicine doctor they're all coming in there and saying the same exact thing like okay so let me sit down and just let me discuss this with you this is the most common and unfortunately we just don't know we don't know what's going to happen you're all in this together oh my god we don't want to hear it you're my dog you're not sure it's just crazy you just take things into your own hands and luckily you have a lot of alternative therapies at Titan Medical and this is why I really wanted to really get out there to people that sometimes you know because they don't know these doctors don't know what to do there are things out that you can do and and they're I guess they would be considered alternative or off-label type stuff and so these doctors won't prescribe in the hospital but you can take matters into your own hands and that's I'm always a big believer in and finding solutions you know that you need to the problems that you have tell us some of the in modalities that you guys use to help you get over this and recover from this illness so that the biggest thing that all the doctors and you know before I left the you know hospital the biggest thing was super high doses of vitamin C right glutathione because they do give glutathione of the hospital if you can believe that or not and and zinc so you know instead of taking it obviously over the counter and a pill format where if you get something over the counter you even know what you're getting and then if you digest it you're only getting what 10% of what you still don't know what you're getting but you know I obviously took the injectable so we have an injectable has glutathione it has vitamin C and it has zinc in it all in the same exact shot and I just took that shot I took that along with the thymocene alpha one I'm a huge believer in the thymocene one and one and so yeah so the three and one is the trifecta shot you have now that's um that's the zinc are trying me right that's the zinc the glutathione and the injectable vitamin C which I've used vitamin C in the past it could be a little like a little painful right in an injectable form right right yeah you just dilute it down with like a vitamin B12 right right you could just dilute it half and half and yeah super highly concentrated yeah is really well I think it's it's see is ascorbic acid so it's the acidity of it probably is what also irritates some of the tissues um interestingly obviously you put zinc right in the bloodstream obviously you know you're observant that's for sure exactly you know you can't believe you need and glutathione I've been saying oh you know banging people in the head with that I mean that's the most important thing for immune system liver health I mean anti-oxygen you know I mean everything that goes wrong during COVID can be counteracted with glutathione it seems you know and our bodies just don't make enough of it and that's really especially as we get older you know I think that's what older people are are hit harder with this this problem well a lot of those a lot of these doctors out there you know especially the old school ones they don't even if you believe it they don't even know about glutathione they don't even know what it is right right how much it's natural producing our body I mean we keep in blood tests for it here so we can tell you what are glutathione levels are and black haeless and this is going to help you know but we know more is better that's that's the thing I mean if you're coming if you're going into like a a war zone okay and you have more tanks and more missiles and more soldiers you're going to win the battle it's just it's pretty odd you know it's pretty logical right if you go in under under arms you get to get overwhelmed by the enemy and they're going to be so you know glutathione is a weapon of mass destruction we can use you know but if you don't have enough of it in your body it's your older maybe and you're not producing as much obviously fortifying with it is is logical I mean you know if you're going to go try to combat you know COVID so what's the dosage of all these ingredients in trifle and that trifle factor reformula sure so for the try new booster it's right the the vitamin C which is 200 milligrams per ML it's also got glutathione which is 200 milligrams per ML and it's got zinc chloride which is 5 milligrams per ML so you're getting all those and one ML per shot so if you're going to do a half you can half that dosage you're going to cut or 70% or whatever you're going to do yeah I mean at the end of the day if you're sick and you want to feel better you don't care you'll do whatever and if you're not sick and you don't want to get sick then you'll do whatever so we had a lot of healthcare workers because we're nationwide so we service nationwide so whatever state people are in we service them right a lot of people especially with the break out we had a lot of healthcare workers are in these different states like like wash and states yeah at all and all these big big place that got hit first even in New York and these people were taking it they were going to get in the patients and they didn't become covid positive they also wrote a review about it which is really cool so you know it's it was used which is a preventative and obviously right now you know people are just thinking about covid 19 but there's other bacterial infections or viruses out there that can still get you six you want to make sure your immune system is built up and five to take in the sense yeah I've been taking a little good to try on you know for a couple years now from you guys and I feel great I never get sick and if anyone gets sick of my ass I get like it lasts like a quarter of the time of everyone else and so now I'm going to add in these I'm going to try the new one the try a immune booster I want to see how that feel on that with the vitamin C as well now another thing you used which we've talked about before but I didn't you know no it would be so relevant to covid was the thymus and alpha one which is we know an immune system modulator that which helps you know enhance the enhanced system if it needs to be and you talk to us about that and how that helped and and what your dosage was you were taking so I was actually taking a higher dosage obviously because I was wanting to do whatever it took to feel better and get back to normal so I mean I was taking the forty units right per day yeah so it was fifty-hundred micrograms per day and you know what I was saying but I don't mean to interrupt you but I would I didn't know you told me before the show was the zidax and is the act there's actually a brand name of uh Simonson alpha one now it's not just a peptide the bodybuilders here that's actually it's like a drug that they're giving now for me that's correct and this is going to be the people with the research yeah I mean with the research coming out right now they're talking about uh T cells and how how how important T cells are as far as your immune system especially with covid-19 yeah well the big thing about that most enough one is the augments T cells which have killer cells and helper cells so basically track down they get the memory of these cells and they go after it again you know T cells after antibodies you know they don't know how long anybody's gonna last in the bloodstream or a system so at that point after that that's where T cells come into and really I mean that's that's what it is they use it as far as like uh chemo patients as far as I say with this speaker for cancer patients too it sounds like a yes yes so it slows cancer growth so when you look up sedaxin which is the farm pharmaceutical name for the commercial product they'll tell you in the website you know obviously when it was FDA approved for so this is one of the FDA approved was for it so at that point you can look it up check it out it's really really cool it's really important are there any side effects like you do you do is there anything like flu like symptoms right like that I even I listen before I even started taking it because I didn't want to take a turn for the worse yeah I made sure to do all my research because I was like I don't want any more side effects because I can't handle any more drugs but yeah I've been taking it now I want to say the like it's been the full 90 days and it'll have to take the 40 units anymore but I mean the regular doses 10 units every day you're going to bed yeah yeah now comes in a 15 milligrams bottle which is 15,000 micrograms so that's a pretty sizes of nice bottle and if you're only taking 500 units a day you know it's like kind of a prophylactic that'll actually want to live in that bottle you know absolutely so it's it's it's it's it's it's a great product you know I haven't even tried it but luckily I haven't needed it but I do you know that's how people have you know cancer so like that and they're always asking what they could take for it and you know I always tell them that the usual litany of vitamins and fortification types stuff like good asylum but I didn't know this is an option and this is something that people should probably look into as you know because them not even if you're not I mean not even if you're sick I mean we have a lot of people that have been taking it just as a you know preventative me personally I went at women's or land we went to a land of our bodybuilding show not just recently we were there for a couple of days I decided not to take it with me obviously because of reconstituted it's cold and I'm like you know I just don't feel like it so I'm being honest but I didn't take it for about six days and on that six day I actually started feeling sick again and I'm like okay okay okay okay okay I bet it's double does when I go help you know it's it's important I think in these times that people have know that there is options you know and once again I personally I'm a preventative type of guy so I like to prevent myself from even getting anything but if you do get it okay here's an option you have to you can increase the dosage and and people can contact you a Titan Medical Center dot com and talk to you about these these formulas that you have and I know you obviously give discounts for people mentioned day polomba and art muscle so you always take care of older people I send over there really well customer services great you know what and I got it also commend you your doctors are great over there because you know telemedicine has gotten like a bad rap like it's like oh they get the crappy doctors you know the duty that's not true you guys actually have doctors that kind of care because I've sent people there and their blood work was often they call me up complaining like oh this doctor wants me to do this and this and it's like he's right I look at their blood work he's actually right he's actually he caught something that probably your normal doctor wouldn't even catch and and he's just wanting you to address it you know and that's what doctors have also do you know yeah go do your donation hurry right it's big for us so I mean patients obviously in the minority there was all to come afterwards because without their health they're not doing anything they're not getting them for a show they're not going on you know lives and you know doing daily quality of life things yeah so I was a big thing with the way to all medicine is now because of covid 19 obviously logistic wise we were already set up for telling that so all around the United States where well he's doctors primary care and we start doing primary care services too for patients throughout the state too as well so primary care we can help them too but you know they weren't set up for this so primary care people are calling us and they're like I can't get in with my doctor even for covid like I don't know if I have covid or not you know so we were able to do this right away for patients and you can tell us it is ironic that you guys yeah it is ironic that a lot of the hormone clinics specifically you guys were completely set up for this it was like it was almost like you guys were made waiting for this to happen you know and really I'm like oh my goodness yeah it was really only now what you did it because it was a convenience because a lot of people out of state couldn't travel but but it really worked to the benefit of even the people in the state so because now no one all of a sudden everybody all these doctors is it didn't you know it said telemedicine no no no no no no no no no no everybody's been telling medicine the world they're all those on it's perfectly fine so yeah you know even like the doctors now you can even email them now like this like when you when I sign into the month my mind short portal you could actually say hey doc you know and talking them they'll actually email you back and say are y'all sending for this test or something like that it's it's it's it's amazing it's a little different it's cool I actually like you now I don't want to wait and doctor I do it's more convenient for me it ought to go there you know went with the rheumatologist after I got the blood worked done because he did a full work up on me for the glupus and all these other things I mean he did it on tell him that I wish they could do my colonoscopy through the telemedicine but unfortunately hey student of Dave soon you'll stick you know take a pill and it's just gonna it's gonna be a camera it's coming yeah mark my words I believe you're right I want to talk about it for me out because I I said a lot of people to you guys for the pregnancy protocol I developed years ago and that was you know to help people get more fertile men get more fertile so they can get their wives you know pregnant and it's worked very successfully in the past you know you get something ingredients on the list weren't really readily available coming soon now finally they're making synthetic FSA which is also known as HMG or pergoneol if any of you guys you know been looking for those things this was something you couldn't get now all of a sudden it's gonna become available and that's usually the key ingredient in raising a man's sperm count talk to us about that coming yeah so FSAH on the manufacturer product is available now so it will be helping patients out with that as far as that goes that along with ACG you know clomeid and glutathione those are the great protocols you know you're behind that protocol 100% so we'll be able to off that to patients you know by themselves or altogether to really make that boom I mean we've helped a number of patients get pregnant you know not knowing if they could get pregnant or they could do you could also send them in for sperm analysis so if they don't even make sure that it's them because some people don't know they think it's automatically them and it could be the wife or you know it could be them who knows so until you really run those tests and really do know or if you just want to take a shot in the dark and say listen I'm just gonna pump up my body right ago well usually in a perception of time for guys that are bodybuilders usually it's it's the guys fault so 99% of the time so but it's great it's great that you guys can do this and provide the service and you know it's funny you can use as little or as many as you want I always say look if you know if you want to fertility dogs that they're gonna charge you 35 thousand dollars per year oh my god 35 thousand per year oh per year oh per year oh alone is 1500 dollars you know and that's for like a week or two you know that so this is a much better way to go and I'm glad that you guys are so we'll be able to give a substantial discount that medication to us right so I'm just throwing out the right now I'm getting a price down I was like that but it would probably run 500 bucks so it's a third of the cost that would you get from a plate when it can't be PG wake way cheaper anyway you know for the patients stuff like that even what they were charging for ATG it's I mean it was like $2,000 for an 11,000 and I knew I'm like ridiculous I mean let me bring that up because a lot of people are very concerned because they heard they heard that ATG will no longer be made and that's not true what's happening is it can't be compounded anymore in a generic app they're March so you're you have to sell the brand name pervinole is that correct I'm sorry I'm sorry about that so correct no excuse me yeah yeah prognol so it's got to be manufactured there are a couple uh compounding pharmacies five with three bees out there which are FDA outsourcing facilities that are going after the biological license that big farm has right now it's a couple million dollars to do and they haven't secured those licenses yet but hopefully they'll be able to do it in compounded ACG will be out there because it will be it will be a lot more inexpensive for patients going bad thing with you know manufacturer products like that is big farmer there are a little bit more expensive as far as that goes but even for us if they had to go for manufacturer prices we're going to give our patients a super discount on it like 150 bucks probably still maybe it's kind of a box maybe up it up 50 bucks bucks more than what we already charged it's still giving to it because we want to try to pass on the saves the patient I mean that's great that you guys are offering that because people worried about that because you know that's a typical you know everybody bill is you know are stopping a cycle or are they going off you know hormone replacement you know they got it today like to do HGG and I know it's part of your your hormone replacement protocol you you prescribe HG to make sure that the testicles keep working so that you know that kind of through a little monkey wrench into what you guys would do in two yeah no 100% at the end of the day I know some of these clinics out there and I've heard this because obviously I can see all the text messages coming in from all of these awesome patients but you know you have to come up with a solution a lot of these doctors just took people off HG they're up so I can get it I don't know what to tell you I just you know here here's some you know here's the rest of your stuff I'm like good and then then they're trying to substitute so I was through the compound farms he's lost a lot of money in this right a lot of revenue because HG is huge weight loss for HRT and stuff like that so what they's inside was alright we're gonna try to look for a substitute so when you start looking at these different substitutes now the DEA is starting to look at peptides over 15 chain of amino acid and base peptides they're really starting to look at okay some these shouldn't probably be on the market yeah so at that point they're looking at they were placed it now with kiss peptin that was supposed to be another one that's supposed to help regulate LH and stuff like that and a lot of clinics have been pushing that and in Coleman Feena not Coleman but there's another one that they're using as far as that goes they're trying to relax a little bit like that yeah well I told John when all this happened I'm like listen we're gonna make any decisions here with our medical staff and everything because obviously we're gonna go over it but I'm not reeducating all these patients that's what these people have been with us for like six years you know I'm like I'm not gonna be like I'm not gonna be like I'm not gonna be one who's better reeducated not you you don't say in that let's say you do reeducate your patients right and then you put them on this peptide now DEA says to the company far as you guys can't make this easy right so then you're back at square one right and you're like oh what I do and now the patient like well you put me on this you put me on this life people will pay a little bit more for the for the brand name Hcg if they have absolutely absolutely 100% you know they're gonna get the best they're gonna get the best results like that too instead of just trying to script together and put together whatever you can to give a patient so we want to make sure that our patients are getting the very best whether it's therapies or patient service you know whatever it is right well I appreciate not only the services you guys offer but also the customer service that you give all the people that he said and over to you and that's why people back in you know look you you're not Walmart okay over there and people have to understand that you're not giving this stuff away for free you know you're not going to lose money over there so they have to understand there is there is there is a business component of the business but you're there to get the people to take the right things if they need that are going to help you know treat whatever issues they have going on and that you're first of all looking at the health first you're not going to just prescribe things to help it's not in perfect order and that's another thing you'll get frustrated like that but yeah some of them don't like that but at the end of the day we'll tell them hey listen your health comes number one let's just fix this let's fix this and then I promise you it'll be easy sailing after that plus you know patients they obviously they obviously get the service right so they're paying for the service too as well they call text email all times a day and night because means you have the phone at night time to not to be like this this is eight years later eight years later I'm still on the text message coming up mine yeah it's like the wall mart it's like a wall mart day if it's tarjet yeah yeah yeah the tarjet people always say to me I'm afraid anyone it's actually too late I said you can't text me too late some possible I said because I go to bed and I'm wrong that you days just roll right they just roll in the middle and you see I think pretty much continuous but that's how I'm

let everyone know the COVID's real I'll tell you look you want to know the truth why you got it and why John didn't get it the the reason is that I got sick and he did it I'm saying you want to know the reason I'm telling you the reason he takes more stuff no no that's the reason is that us men and I could speak for him and I were weak we couldn't handle it when what you went through and I was in the basket cases we probably would have died and yes Amanda I'm going to record it yeah I'm editing the night look I truly I completely admit that she's way stronger than I am that sense matter we can't handle that stuff you could still run a family in a business and also be sick we couldn't handle it so that's why you got the COVID need and that's the reason that's fine size if you want to
