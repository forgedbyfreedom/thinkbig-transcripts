RxMuscle.com這Astave better known as hashtagAstaveYou're a 30 minute question an answer show what they plumbounderholds the for rookie Glantigen join us as always anything and everything is on the table die training supplementation I have the pros competitions of course the competition seems to be in full swing as we speak and all that now it was in bringing they plumbo Dave by the time this video goes help people have on our channel your preview more or less a reaction video to the New York pro line of being released yesterday and you and I just talking all fair a couple of minutes ago we both agree this is arguably maybe easily one of the deepest if not the deepest line of the New York pro has had in years I mean you look at the the the competitor sheet he invalidate John Delittor also jump off the sheet immediately max Charles who had a sensational following at the all and then you have the wildcard you had doing Walker Dave we just started the tempo pro Hassan most often Justin Rodriguez has been great at the New York pro previous years give the audience a primer of your reaction to this line it's it's deep which means that we don't know who's going to win which means that it's exciting for the fans and that press to watch these shows because there's not a foregone conclusion I mean John I did in my reaction video to this line if you'll see I mean John Delittor rose is the most accomplished you know guy in the lineup he probably has the most pro wins he's you know he's got to be considered the better when he really has no weaknesses aside from the fact that he doesn't really sometimes nails conditioning when he's 100% he's really tough to beat you know because he doesn't have any gaps and holds in his physique and he's not going against really winkler here and and bone act you know he's going against the guys that he's you know his contemporaries who we can handle in this line up obviously if he and value puts it all together I don't think he could be beat just because he's that he's bigger and he's a he's a bigger structure on stage I think he'll look more impressive in the lineup but we haven't seen him do that you know he's got some you know anxiety issues about the whole thing but you know what the fact that he kind of bond out at Tampa even though he's still play second I think that's going to make him come back even better at this show so I think we're going to see a really good of the year he'll be tough to beat obviously Patrick Moore in this line up too he didn't mention in the internet and Quentin Arena who's super impressive he's been impressing me ever since the last year and a half that the progress he's made is mind-boggling I think he's game like 20 something pounds or maybe more here's a guy with you know freaky like Melvin Anthony structure and I think that he's going to you know surprise a lot of people and of course if Hassan Mastoff would put it all together bring the conditioning he's another guy who's just got utils and utils of you know Egyptian muscle on him you know he's coming from that same school of a thought of bigger and he's got just billowy you know muscle no gaps in this physique but we haven't seen him put the final touches on it yet and bring this to pen this conditioning it's anyone show Justin Rodriguez is in this lineup and he's danger so it's exciting because we don't know who I can't even I couldn't even pull top five out and you know and say for sure this is going to be it because invariably there's going to be some guys that are you know big names that are not at their best and then there's going to be guys that aren't such big names who are going to be at their best and they may sneak into that top five group because we unexpectedly because maybe some of the the name guys are a little off so it's a great lineup I think Steve Weinberg got to be happy with this this you know I hope you know that the thing that stinks is we got a great lineup but we can't even have a crowd in in the audience they're watching it so it is what it is but it'll be great for the fans hopefully will be a nice live stream I don't know what the deals that I haven't really looked at up yet I'm sure there will be one and we'll probably be you know analyzing this show for the next you know two weeks after because it's going to be so exciting because of all the different you know types of physics we have and you remember all these physics are completely different John Del Arroz that Ian Valier I mean those guys are about as diametrically different as you can possibly ask for but yet they're both top tier body goals so it's going to be a good good near pro we selfishly for me I was so looking forward to coming to show obviously no longer in New York now in Tampa they have four good questions I don't know if you address this in the video or I don't know if anything was announced pertaining to the Olympia slots similar to what we were told about the the show in Alicante Spain about two to three the top two or three depending on the division or I'm going to get Olympia births is there anything like that that's going to apply to this year problem I haven't heard any changes announced that doesn't mean that it can happen post-humility but I think that's the right work but but I think that they're doing that in Europe said because there's only one show right whereas this multiple shows in the US so we might not see the you know three top three going to the Olympia in the US it's in Europe probably because there are other shows still happening here you know and I you know the Tampa I mean Chicago was moved but it's going to be in Atlanta so we have more shows before the Olympia where that shows in Spain maybe the only one and so I think that's why they did that fair point let's go to the questions of first two questions of course in the day polamo experience app first question day of taking T3 T4 increases cellular metabolic rate what is stand to a reason that taking it would also increase protein synthesis and thus serve to enhance muscular development taking extra thyroid hormone okay specific T3 since that's active thyroid home could potentially increase protein synthesis if you're a little low if you're already at the max you know words if you're at if your if your levels are good or ready it you know high levels you probably won't see an increase in protein synthesis from a from taking extra T3 matter if I can take too much you could actually look you could actually eat up muscle because it's it's increases metabolic rate too fast however however you know you got to remember that when you take T3 it's because you're trying to lose body fat so it's by increasing that amount great you're obviously increasing you know fat mobilization carbohydrate utilization if you're taking something that's protein sparing like animal steroids with it or GH with it you're going to spare the muscle tissue so it's not really going to build more muscle but it's going to certainly burn more fat second question again from the day polamo experience app day of really puzzled i'm lean with a low carb diet and no matter what I do still have a lower abdominal bulge hardly knows some cute that would this be because of visceral fat how could I get rid of it it's really annoying you know having a a descended lower stomach you know usually the look a lot of guys have upper stomachs the the lower stomach distension usually at least to me that usually spells or smells no pun intended of not emptying your bowel properly meaning that you probably need a fiber supplement so adding a fiber supplement like fiber lies you know twice a day will help get rid of that that fecal matter that's kind of hanging out there and and distending your stomach now can it also be visceral fat yeah but usually visceral fat will will be you know the entire you know the entire abdomen will be because you gotta remember we are visceral fat is accumulated is not necessarily it does go in between the organs everything but there's a there's a layer called the momentum the greater momentum the covers the entire abdominal cavity and that's what gets fatty so it it wouldn't just be in one little pocket like that so to me that smells of you know let's get it not not not to be too to gross smells of the fact that you're not getting rid of all your waste and so that could be a fiber issue so I would try to do that now these two questions came from the day before I'm going to experience that this is an app that I offer you can get it from your iTunes store or Android store all the writings I've ever done all the videos I've ever done in one place let's say do an exclusive Q&A video every week just for the app members and I answer everyone's questions and I answer them in a public forum in the app so that everyone sees everyone's questions and answers so it's kind of like learning experience we put up a workout every single week there you can follow it's a great it's a great resource to have at your fingertips or in your pocket you can read it when you know totally you can do it pretty much is right there you always have the ability to ask me questions and I will answer them like I said in a public forum on the app the best questions get answered in a video format which goes up once a week so for 29 bucks a month you're getting a lot of value and a lot of people are really enjoying it you might want to just check it out we give the first 10 days for free so you can try it no obligations if you like it you continue just keep going with it if you don't you can cancel and it's no obligations there let's go to our Instagram questions again if you're not following this it's under official underscore rx muscle if you're watching us for the first time on youtube hit the subscribe button below if you like what you're watching hit the like button give us a comment obviously it helps us in as always we appreciate your support um first question is about someone who we thought we were going to see the new euro pro i'm not sure if you address this in your video Evan sent a pony not on the competitor list so presumably not competing so the question is from john walter is Evan sent a pony making a mistake not competing this year you know i don't even know why he's not competing beyond so i probably should reach that because then we would talking about him is a potential guy that can do really some damage in this lineup on heavy muscle radio early this week before the competitor list was released i had texted see why burger and i said who's competing and he said gave me some of the guys and then he said you know uh Evan sent a pony might compete and i don't so i don't know why he decided not to obviously if he if there was a might there that means that he he had been dieting preparing for the show and maybe he just felt he wasn't ready so maybe we're gonna see him in chicago which would really be in it land there obviously because that's what that show is gonna take place maybe he just needed more time remember he did come back from a quiet you know uh tear a couple years ago and this would be his first show back so you know maybe it was a good idea to skip it for Evan because it is a tough lineup here um there's a it is stacked to the health maybe going for the next one might be a better option if he's looking to qualify for the Olympia let's go to jibby power 66 is there a huge difference in terms of muscle activation between the lying t bar rho and a normal t bar rho uh or a t bar rho using the v handle as a grip like all of them but don't know if one is better than the other you know what the right answer to that question is there's no right answer and then the the fact is that you have to use the handle and position that you feel the most activation of your back you know when i would do pull downs you know i see a lot of guys go really wide grip pulling that and you know what i kind of didn't feel that much of my last you know and i couldn't go heavy enough really to get a good pull and i saw a video door in the eights did where he said you know the best you know hand position on pull downs is a closer grip because you're stronger when your arms are closer to your body and you know what that's probably the case for guys with long arms like dory and like me and i so i i tried it and i noticed much better results but i see guys that have shorter arms to go really wide and for them it's fine because they don't have a long their arm is reaching out to the the very ends of the bar so you got to you got to use positions and handles that you feel in the muscle that you're trying to work the best you can't take my advice because i have a different you know framework and the biomechanics and say a different guy which shorter arms it might be a little shorter and height you got to do what works for you so the right answer is try out all the different positions find what works best for you and then stick with that and obviously it's a good idea to throw different positions in every once in a while but you'll know what what the meat potatoes of what your you need to do is i always found that you know i was able to do reverse grip bent over rows as well as overhand see okay i do overhand now because i'm not looking to tear a bicep but you know but it didn't bother me some guys they they don't have the flexibility to to supinate their hands all the way to do that position so they're stuck like this and so never really fell good for them to do that so they shouldn't do reverse grip they should just do overhand grips and so you got to find what works for your body let's go to jj fitness day europeanian on the belief that type my fascia is a limiting factor in overall muscle growth you know that was a that was a a theory put forth or probably by many people but but john parilla was a big you know my alfashile stretching guy you know he felt that yeah to do like this brutal stretching techniques to really stretch that fascia to allow the muscle to expand and grow and you know and that that was the for a long time that was the theory of how muscles grew like they would like in other words the growth was limited by how much the fascia would expand and i just don't you know it made sense at the time you know but it's just not the case you know the muscle will find the way to expand if it wants to grow if not you'll just feel very tight fascia sheets around them i mean this people to get what's called the a theory compartment syndrome their lower leg because their calf muscles get so big and then that that fascia can't stretch but the calf doesn't stop growing it just gets bigger and then that fascia gets so tight they have to actually go in there and surgically open up a little bit slice it open so i don't think that that's the case having said that however i think stretching is good for flexibility purposes to get full range of motion when you're doing it because i see a lot of guys they they do partial range of motion and i'm asking the gym while you're doing that they're like i can't go down any further i can't they literally are stuck because they're not stretching enough so there there is a definite benefit to stretching you know once the muscles warmed up of course never stretch cold and getting that muscle so it's but i remember to the end of my career you know i really would have to stretch do a little warm up in stretch before i did legs if i want to really get a full range of motion and and move fluently where i was all stiff you know and i think that was a lot to do it because i was sitting a lot in a computer desk and i was getting all cramped up in it and it's funny the last couple days i was i was been walking around like i'm 90 years old because it's everything stiff and i went in the pool view of the day did a couple laps and was swimming and the next day i felt like i thought i was going to be sore from that i was actually i felt better than next day because i was loose all i loosened up all those muscles sometimes sitting for too long is not necessarily a good thing let's go to m nixiu ski we've gotten these questions before but new audiences like to get them back into the mix your opinion on artificial sweeteners such as plenta during prep some people say it makes your stomach bloated on state i haven't really noticed any um abdominal issues from from that however having said that i i will prep a sit by saying that some people have our more sensitive to artificial sweeteners than others in some situations some people's gut you know they're back to bacteria the gut ferment these things and they produce gas from it so if you're a person that that doesn't do well with artificial sweeteners and you get gas in and bloated from it they don't use them you know cut a amount a couple days before the show there's nothing wrong with that you know and go to water you know it's fine but if you can get away with drinking diet so it is in diadrinks and it doesn't bother you stomach and then stick with that i you know there's nothing wrong with it you know you have to kind of experiment you know because once again everyone is different you got to remember the the the the gut bacteria ferment you know uh prebiotic you know fibers meaning that like you know imulin fiber which is in stevia balance um even just just regular fiber supplements in general that they eat this stuff that's what they do and they weigh the eat is they ferment it and sometimes some people when the a lot of fermentation going on there is gas production but usually usually it reduces that because what it's doing is it's helping to move the you know fiber supplements will also move all the fecal waste out of the body quicker so everyone's different you know and everyone responds to things differently and you have to do some trial and error that's why you never experiment with something new like the week of a show it's ridiculous if you haven't been doing it all long don't edit it in the last week okay and and then you know crush your fingers that it's going to work that's not the way to do it you experiment ahead of time you take notes and observations to see how you body responds to different things diadrinks and i drink it yeah okay great if i can't drink it it does blow up my stomach and i got to cut it out of week before the show and that's all the written you know that's how you go about it perhaps a philosophical question here i i'm i'm not going to try to pronounce the name they one question why is it hard to grow without the use of gear once you touch it it seems like you've been waiting your time with our dieting and working out why is such a massive difference recovery strength the adding size simple diet of work i think means nothing without the gear and without the work or the diet the gear is nothing he goes in conclusion body building is the hardest sport out there it is the hardest sport out there because it's it's a accumulation of all these variables together but if you don't have diet and training and and and sleeping down properly then then you could take a little bit gear you want it's not going to do anything we all know that so the gear just makes things work better you know it's kind of like an enhancer so the problem is that no one gets the other variables down pat and then they take gear and they get moderate so so results from it you know you take gear everyone's going to grow from that okay to a certain degree but how much you grow and the benefits you get okay from it are really dependent on the other variables you know when i took my first cycle my diet was perfect my training was perfect i i i responded so well you know i was gaining 25 pounds you know 20 to 25 pounds a year of muscle for the for five years in a row there was a reason because i had all the variables perfect before i ever took gear okay had i taken gear and i didn't have these variables perfect that i probably went to meet those kind of gates and that's it that's an important thing to understand now having said that i made it very good games the first couple years i the first four or five years that i was training okay without gear just by learning to eat right and train right so if i would have taken gear then i would have been wasting my time because i would have been using the gear to grow and then when i actually needed the gear it wouldn't be there and that's why you got guys like Ronnie Coleman who were natural for many years they started taking gear and their body is exploded because they they had maximized his ability to train he trained heavy he you know he ate right he lived the body but we lifestyle it didn't matter that he was an undrugs so when he added those in it just made everything work better another person that comes to mind kighine responded incredibly as well same thing same look at Sean Clarita look at the the the gains he's made the best three four years he was a natural body but it's so so you got to understand that the the gear is not that important until you hit a point where you've maximized everything you could have done prior to that and then you added in and you get that added benefit of a really getting explosive growth let's go to nick wall in 66 what changes do you think flex Lewis will need to make it to be his absolute best going from two twelve to the open this coming Olympia i don't think he has to make any changes i think now he just doesn't have to drop as much weight i mean think about the guy was probably in shape you know six weeks out from the Olympia and any had to try to figure a way to make weight which is basically lose muscle over dehydrate yourself nothing nothing dumber to do for bodybuilding you know shoved into the loose muscle in fact over to plate yourself but if that's the way you can make weight then that's the only way you can make weight so i think it becomes in now at his natural weight you know which is whatever it's been up i don't know what he's up to now you know we're gonna see how much better flex those we're gonna see how much more round freaky grainy you know flex Lewis he might not be that much bigger you know people think always gonna be twenty pounds he he might not be he but if he was two twelve at the two twelve Olympia the last time he competed years ago he might be two twenty two which is ten pounds but you know why he probably sucked down eight or eight to ten pounds he might be what he was had he not had to suck down only in better shape and so that would be a devastating look with his frame his height and his muscle bellies so i'm excited i think a big mistake that he could make is that he tries to come into big and doesn't bring that same brain but i know flex and i know Neil Hill did not gonna make that that's an amateur mistake to make he's gonna come in just as good as he was conditioning wise at all as Olympia's definitely is gonna be bigger and that's gonna be deadly that's a deadly combination of them i'm gonna be exciting for everyone what we've been debating this topic since the belief twenty fourteen twenty fifteen that you know when the role was started they could be considering it uh finally now is gonna come to a reality in a matter of three and a half months let's go to Benny and that's Ivan do you burn a lot of fat in between back to back shows when you're not doing cardio but you're depleting depleting hard and carbing up and cheating post show you know i i think you do i think you get a rebound i i you know have had people do shows and then i feed them more i do give them less cardio and they continue to lose fat somehow because i think they're it's like their metabolism's are an overdrive and it's good to take advantage of that the problem is that a lot of people will be afraid to eat more as they think well i got another show coming up in two weeks i got a train even harder you know now you only do that if you need to get leaner but if you're in shape for the first show you have to actually eat more do less cardio cut back to fapper is a little bit otherwise you risk coming into depleted to flat and you won't be able to recover from that and that's you know i'm working with you know with the field plahars in that situation now i mean i'm giving them if you sort of food i'm giving them this best week or so he's eating a lot you know he's eating like burgers and fries every night because i got to keep this guy full you know he cares metabolism is just cranking away and that you know you gotta do you gotta do you know to take nor that and if i were to keep just training harder and harder and pushing a more more more he would have just come in small and depleted and that's not the look you're looking for so you have to understand that after doing your first show look for that metabolic you know increase it it happens every time well scotton kneel zelewski who has a perhaps a new nickname for you call you Dave the dentist killer now is that something that we can potentially go down a shirt i don't know yes so why am i the dentist killer you don't remember the story from two weeks ago i'm losing my mind again i don't sleep if you don't sleep you don't you don't solidify memories because i said i'm supposed to go this Monday and pick up the the mouth guard that that he made me the third one and i actually i think i sub consciously overslapped on purpose i completely forgot about the appointment and i knew i knew the night before i said i got to go that dentist the morning and i just i just didn't get up and i didn't even think about it i said i said i love the message and i purposely didn't call them back because i'm kind of giving them like i'm like i you know what let them let them hold on to the night guard a little bit even though i paid for it already you know because at this point what's a difference i already waited all this time i'm that you know i'd rather get a couple extra hours sleep than to be exhausted for the day because the i already know what's going to happen i'm going to go back there it's not going to fit me again and they're going to have to make it again and i'm going to go nuts and do a crazy wrath even worse than the last one so i figured i might be well rested but i'm going to do my rant so his question is does EQ lower estrogen or is it bro science the only study i found is show that the metabolites of EQ can act like an AI but that's one study what have you seen in your experience i don't think EQ acts like in a enrumptace inhibitor at all no i i haven't seen that i haven't noticed it empirically at all we know master on can act like an estrogen receptor antagonist we know it can actually do that so but that's pretty well-documented you can tell you get a little dryer on on on master on haven't noticed that on EQ i think if that was the case a lot of people would probably take it right up to a show and you probably could you probably could do testing EQ up to a show if you had i knew people in the past did it like that not that those such as guys take today but you could but it's it seems to be more of an offseason you know stat or at least in the maybe like the first eight weeks of contest prep guys will use testing EQ to get started but then then that seems to be a drug most people pull the last six days week so i would say no let's go we'll take three more questions go to classic busy nash i already eat plenty of chicken beef eggs and rice and still struggle but on mass my question is what are some cheap quality foods to bump up my total daily protein fat and calorie intake i make them across the homework science that i guess generally when you have a situation like that somebody who's struggling to proximate what would your guidelines be and and i was seen by a it's a financial issue he wants to go cheap that's what i mean that's what i'm getting it you want that yeah look when i was when i had no money and i was in school and i would i would i would go get the cheapest whenever they have sales on tuna i would go buy cases of the stuff and i used so much tuner in white minute rice i can't tell you how much about that i ate now in age what i would do is i would i would back then i was eating peanuts with it but you know peanuts is not really a great source of that i would buy like a couple like a case of my macadamia nuttoil which is very recently price and i would just be pouring maccoil into my rice in tuna and just be eating that all day along that i mean that that's like my father would call that poverty food but he said yeah i don't understand why you like poverty food you know because that that's i always like you know dry it out you know stuff and you know i always ate the the cuts of meat that my father would consider to stuff the eight when he was during the depression you know i never i didn't like fatty cuts of meat i just wasn't into like the whole you know your prime rib and that kind of stuff and sirloin stays to had fat hanging off him i was more of like a top round you'll wonder broil which is a really lean cut a lot of people don't like it because it's a little tougher but that's just me you know i i i find that i you know i did well with that but you know now i know knowing what i know about fats now i would like i said i would be pouring macadamia nuttoil maybe buying some avocado's you know mix in there and rice tuna and fats i mean come on and do it i mean that's the easiest even have canned chicken now if you go to like a sams club which is like a price club they have like you know i buy i know a man likes it we buy like they're they're in cans i was like tuna only it's chicken so you might want to switch around if you want to do chicken you can one day you can do tuna another day it's relatively cheap two comes in big cans and you can eat that all day long i mean there's no it there's no excuse why you can't get enough protein if you go and use to go the canned chicken or canned tuna route and just buy some cheap minute rice big you could buy big bags of it cooks in like couple minutes in the microwave it's so simple and then you have some oil you have a bag of nuts or almonds or walnuts or you know and or just used like a bag because they get a nice bottle of oil or macadamia nuts even you know are pretty good but i like the oils because they kind of mix into the food really easy i used to have like these big tub where containers where i put tuna rice and usually pour some at that time it was no macawai we were all of oil over and that's what i would eat all day long and it was delicious i didn't get a lot of time for a couple of more questions let's go to shad water fit i've always heard that taking gh and insulin at the same time can be counterproductive what is the science behind this is this related blood sugar levels in different ways with each hormone when is the best time to take apart from each other if this is the case they don't compete with each other essentially but usually in in the natural state when you ever insulin levels are high gh levels allow and when gh levels are high insulin levels allow so they work in tagging is typically to each other naturally in the body however if you put them into the body at the same time they will synergize each other believe it or not so there's nothing wrong with taking them to get i used to take my insulin shot with my gh in the morning because the insulin will override the the gh's effect of being a creating an insulin resistance in the body so that's that's a good thing you know so it'll enable you to absorb your food but yet still get the growth effect from the from the growth hormone so there's nothing wrong with taking them at the same time because you're taking two geogenous hormones you're not trying to release them from the body you're actually taking the hormone and putting it in there and that's a big difference now if you were trying to say oh i'm going to take this amino acid to try to make my body release gh and i'm going to try to take this other you know food to try to cause insulin surge now you're having to worry about well can i do both at the same time maybe not but when you're actually injecting the actual hormone doesn't matter last question it is from n-royer 31 and this is only you spoken about before in terms of that dark place that you have to go when you're training heavy super super heavy they visit normal to be so intense when training that you get really nervous before every time you go to the gym and when at the gym going into a quote really dark place to be able to get under the really heavy weights yeah i i i would be thinking when i would do legs i would think about that workout all day long it was it was terrible it was like a leg day oh oh i'm going to have to do legs and it wasn't i loved legs because i love the feeling of it i liked the the progress i made but i knew it was going to be a very very uncomfortable workout i knew that i was going to be putting weight on my back that i wasn't comfortable with doing myself i was going to need a spotter that I trusted there with me i knew that it was going to be an uncomfortable day but it was okay because that's that's what i was putting all my effort into and so i would go rehearse the workout in my mind a little bit throughout the day thinking about what i need to do how i was going to eat to prepare for the workout you know what i was going to put it to my stomach pre workout today wouldn't throw up you know getting nauseous usually it was a shake that usually sat well in my stomach and when i got into the gym you know it was it was all work you know and of course the first couple set you know the only real bad set is the last one the sets you know you can do the weight because you've done it before it's not a big deal when you get to that last set where you get to have to wrap your knees get that belt on perfect you have to talk to your training partner hey you got to have to watch me here watch me in the way down you know whatever you know this might be a weight that you've never really executed you know no or either that or maybe you're going for more reps and you've ever done and you want to make sure that if you get stuck this this training partner is going to get you up okay and you know that your nervous system is going to get traumatized from all that weight you're going to have on your back but but this is what you're doing and you're laying on the line because you want to make your legs better than they were the last time you want to improve on stage so you have to get into that mindset of look I got to challenge myself every time then in the gym whether it's one more wrap or a little more weight or more
