Daypalomo here with another RX supplement review and you know there's been a couple of healing peptides on the market and to let everyone know what a peptide is. A peptide is the sequence of amino acids, protein basically. When linked together in a certain sequence using certain amino acids create some sort of a hormonal product and the peptides that have been cell sold on the market probably for the last 10 years now in a great type of area have done a lot of different things anywhere from growth hormone release to IGF1 simulation to now this whole new category of what we call healing peptides that are out there on the market. Now as you know I'm very good friends with the people at the Titan Medical Center at Titan Medical Center dot com and they have been having their compounding labs work on some of these healing peptides to help provide a viable source of them from a legitimate United States pharmacy to people who are interested in using them to help tissue regeneration. I talked a little bit a few weeks ago about BPC of 157 and I had a really good experiment with that. I was feeling really good on it. Well I just received the newest healing peptide from Titan Medical Center and it's known as TB4 or thymus in beta4. This is a slightly different healing peptide. Once again it's involved in tissue regeneration. Matter of fact there's been a lot of studies on this one particular healing peptide with regard to cardiac healing. So if you've had any kind of cardiac episodes or damaged your heart possible you know possibly maybe from blockages there we had some you know some lack of oxygen to the muscle and you had some death in the cell muscle maybe you're not producing a good cardiac output from your left ventricle maybe you just have rhythm or abnormalities like I do I have a slight rhythmia supposedly at least from the research I'm reading TB4 has some great cardiac regenerative effects and the way it implements this is it stimulates satellite cells also known as stem cells we know them today as stem cells and it takes these tells these stem cells to turn into new cardiac tissue so it'll help repair a damaged heart or maybe fix a heart that's not working exactly the way it should be. The good thing is that that TB4 can do this in muscle tissue as well so surrounding all the muscle cells in our body we have a different shape of cells that we used to call satellite cells now we call them stem cells and supposedly TB4 can help you know repair damage there mostly but it's mostly works it's magic intendons ligaments okay and connective tissue so if you have joint issues if you have tendon problems TB4 might be a good solution for you I received mine in the mail the other day I started taking it I'm going to report you know I'll report exactly the benefits that I'm getting from it but I will say this I'm not a sore when I do go to the gym I don't go to the gym that much and here's the problem because I only go to the gym sometimes once a week I get really sore after okay because I'm not you know when you go regularly you just don't get sore anymore but so I do and I've noticed that when I started taking the TB4 I'm actually regenerating faster I'm actually not getting that's soreness for two or three days after that the lay the muscle soreness and I think my body is healing it and for me I know this is an important thing because I'm not taking anything else I take no hormone replacement right now I'm on a little bit of Hcg you know maybe once every two weeks but other than that I'm on nothing else so just adding the TB4 definitely has improved my ability to recover from workouts how it's doing that like I said I don't know specifically but I think from the research it shows that the body is is recruiting these stem cells and allowing them to help heal the tissue and actually add to the tissue so theoretically you could be increasing your your genetic pool of muscle cells but I think more so it's really target it seems to be targeting tissue muscle tissue as well as connective tissue I have joint problems once again I have a really bad right shoulder the left shoulder has been replaced so this is my good shoulder now and you know I'm trying to delay getting this one done maybe till the end of the year and I'm in you know having trouble sleeping in night since I started taking the TB4 I haven't been in in pain at night and that's a good sign for me so once again I don't think I'm going to heal all the joint degeneration in there with the stuff but if it's going to help delay and help my body recover that's that's very promising and it's promising for for guys who are bodybuilding who maybe just started to damage their body and then there's I might be too late and I shall do but you guys out there you know you're damaging muscle your repair muscle tissue by eating your protein you take animal austerity build muscle tissue but what do you really do if you join to connective tissue TB4 maybe the answer you know how much to take I've been taking 400 micrograms per day and from what I've you know the research I've read from the people I've talked to if you do that for about two weeks you can then kind of cut back to maybe twice or three times a week as a maintenance type dose you don't have to do it every day but I would advise doing for two or three weeks in a row initially to heal whatever you know is yelling you joint wise or muscle wise once you feel better then you can implement a maintenance dose to the stuff and once again I love the fact that it has great effects on cardiac tissue I also speculate that it might help kidney regeneration as well and liver you know because it it seems weird that it would work on connected tissue muscle and and heart but it wouldn't do these other things the reason why we don't know for sure is that they have another research yet the research has been on cardiac tissue especially which is very promising is after so-ins had a hard attack and they've actually had hypoxic damage that means the the tissues of them a heart haven't been exposed to enough oxygen because it was a blockage in an artery and the tissues died or had you know cell death there when they gave the TV for these tissues regenerated or new satellite cells or new stem cells came in and took the place of these old dead cells and remodel the heart very very promising product if you guys want to check it out you go over to titemeticalscenter.com you can tell in day Palombo our ax muscle set you they're going to give you a great discount and they're going to get you started on this product and I'm telling you you know it you have no fear because you know it's being made in a US pharmacy it's not coming from China you know the word making time and answer or whether what you're using is really TV for this is the real deal check it out once again titemetical center dot com telling day Palombo sent you
