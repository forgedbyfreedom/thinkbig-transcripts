. Brian Elderbrain with all right muscle.com. Here at the huge Olympia weekend in Vegas. My carousel turned pro-lastry in August in Dallas. This first show since then and absolutely smokes 410 pounds on the log press. Thanks Brian. Appreciate it. Yeah. It felt good today and when I pretty easy I was about I didn't have to do 420 dollars. I was getting kind of tired. Tom McClure picked up the 390 and strict pressed it. Like I've never seen before and I thought I'm not sure he was going to have it. You picked up the 410 made it look easy. It was really nice lift. Yeah. Tom's an animal. I thought he was going to get it for sure. That's why I was getting ready for 420 but I'm glad it didn't have to do it. Good. All right. Well, hopefully we'll see you again here in the winter circle. Over the next couple of rounds. Good luck with the medley that's coming up next. Until the next time, Brian Elderbrain with all right muscle.com.
