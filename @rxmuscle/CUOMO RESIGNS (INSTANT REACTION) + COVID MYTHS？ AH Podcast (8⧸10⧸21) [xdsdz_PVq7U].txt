If you want to be your apps, you'll best join the evolution. Welcome back to another exciting episode of After Hour. I'm the Palombo, and I'm of course joined by John Romano. I think we try to start today's show, John and I for a second, so we can get a few words and edge-wise before the rest of the maniacs join us. It elevates our intellect. Or the appearance of it, you know. Now I want to talk about the little later in the show, Lewis Jurenell is going to be joining us, the Big Saxi. Big six. Who ran for mayor as we know out there in the ocean side a couple of months back, and he's been fighting City Hall, so to speak, because of keeping the gym open and all the regulations over there in California. Obviously you heard Quomo was just resigned, I don't know if you heard that. Thank God. And then we knew that was coming. So he's out. We'll talk about him. I'm sure he's balancing a lot of a few things to say about that. It's such a crazy political arena right now. A new study was done in South Korea, and I want to talk about this with Lewis when he comes on 76,000 people involved with a study their lifestyle and habits and their risk of contracting COVID, number one, having a problem in terms of sickness with COVID, and then of course death. And you'll find once we go over this study, well, don't put it up your title title, wait to Lewis comes on. But this is correct. I got correct you, which is 212,700,600. Yeah, yes. Korean adults aged plus or minus 20 years. I thought it was 76,000. No, 212 right here. Okay, right, you're right. They looked, I think they looked back in all those two. Yes. What's going on, guys? So we're celebrating Cuomo's resignation. I was just watching it. That's what they took. What a pathetic speech that was by him and his lawyer. What did they say? I didn't listen. And basically, basically, I hug everybody. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong. I'm really sorry. Just bullshit. Just if you could come up with the most bullshit excuse, that even wouldn't be. He's probably like, look, Trump admitted to grab in there. Pussies, I didn't do that. You know. No, you know what you're saying? He basically saying right with John said that he hogs when he kisses everybody. And he's saying that they're taking it out of contact basically. Like, I didn't mean it the way they're taking it. But there's 170 people. And now they're saying there's even more than just stuck his tongue in it throwing suck us finger up them. But that's it. You know, I'm with that. Yeah, right. That's how I read everyone. But here's the, there's some countries. That's, that's the, that's the one. Yes. And a fart burping it to fucking, right, yes. Yeah. That's in fucking can say that that's showing, wow, I really dug that meal, you know. Yeah. But they, but, are we on? We're on. We're on, we're on. Okay, so what do we start? No, but did the other thing is he's, he's a, he's got a lot of trouble. Because if they start, he's all the flexion he killed you know how many fucker people that guy killed thousands. Do Trump sent that boat? you know what I mean he said the boy set up you know the trepid all that he said and fucking nobody used it even a Jacob job at center nobody was using it because you know he was sticking everybody into old age on the church that he had is a you know nursery on he just want nursing on he just wanted fucking you know uh... to do things his own way you know he i think we wanted was he was hoping and it would initially was working he was becoming very popular with doing those those week does daily updates people wanted to hear the latest and greatest people loved him miserable news you know he think it i'm gonna run for president after this i'm gonna remember when the presidency from this you know well at one point they were talking about oh my god he should be the president yeah but he likes to play mob you know i mean play mafia his father i hate his father too you know i mean it's a new mario plomo yeah i mean it's a it's a joke but you know it's just a i i just get an issue some how come all of a sudden with the uh... a little sidebar here with the coveting how come who is your own what's up exactly how how could all of a sudden the covet's bed in a fucking what in the summer when summer's post to be like you know all everybody's vitamin d's up to fucking sons out and uh... and traditionally no virus uh... it's the usually drives in the summer you only drives how come it's driving now because they're because they're not accurate accurate numbers they're fudge in the numbers by attributing everything to covet everything yeah you know just like anything else you give a bunch of rats poison if it'll start killing them and any stops killing you know why could the rafting developing a mune is that that's that's that's another thing but the that reporting is what the main problem is because the reporting is what indicates the severity and the actions taken by people who have some authority the problem with the numbers is that they're all off their all wrong they're co-mingled the regular influences gone we we we we we we we i'm how that along with a moment of holding with the common cold and we weren't even trying when we cure that right and then and and but you can still get a flu shot a regular flu shot for something that's not even there anymore okay so you got that both of the combined the covid shot with the flu shot in here now coming up you'll be able to get it don't condone and he's right here to get a throne HIV shot and it's a dog joke it's every time a five-fucking friend used to get to flu shot and every he got to flu every year i don't believe it but when i was saying about the reporting Greg is it if you go to the hospital with a hang nail okay and you sum out and you go under surgery and you die from the hang nail surgery but you test positive for covid they will list your death as covid you're right now i heard that you have a heart attack and die and they tested you're causing death is covid not the heart attack any cause of death that has covid associated with the person whether they have it or test positive for it they listed cause of death is covid and that's absolutely wrong and here we are lockin down places, convaccines, mandatory some jobs you can't even have anymore without getting vaccinated and all of these numbers are fake plus i think the vaccine is creating that's another thing because creating a virus to communicate that's a bad thing well it's also causing the illness and it's going to also cause socialism here because once you start with that, let's get to our job you're a pamphlet you know what i mean let's get to our job yeah, more people have died on days one two and three after the covid shot and all other evaccines combined 45 that between 11 and 45 thousand depending on who you're listening let's let's look at a more positive aspect of this whole thing which and that's why i brought Lewis in because Lewis has been fighting city hall over there in uh out is Jim and California there for for over over a year now obviously and what what's the latest update there Lewis today are they unlocked out what what what's your status up there with the Jim i think he's gone i think we're lost here yeah nope that was a little bit of what you guys do but anyway it was he's here in me ranty yeah I couldn't take it but John don't you think though to summertime bro need summertime to comical to flu everything a you you why I don't think the virus is something kind of that's great that because of what i just explained that's not such a hot summer to be when staying inside Greg that's the problem that's why they're not here in the building it that's the important well this definitely is definitely a lot more cases here i know i understand John i agree with you i know that i know that you know if you throw a fart that's COVID i agree with you with that said the numbers are definitely skewed but but these people with this papers and a vaccine and all the sudden shit you know you know i i think you united or Delta think Delta they they don't if you don't get back said you can't work for Delta yeah i mean i got a lot of people the only people should be able to dictate i think the military i think if you're in the military you don't have you you have no right you really they shot they shoot you so close shit you got to be you can't even have a choice you're right that's the only place i think that is it's that you you have that's been going on since there's been no it's not you got your you you you signed that away you said that i let's i want to go over this study because you know what there's been a lot of you know the the first thing they seem to close in the gym as always whenever they want to walk things down which is and we've been saying you know since the beginning that obviously exercise is important about low-ish you back okay good sorry no it took a it took a turn turn your phone sideways and we get you you full view he can't say like this guy yeah yeah yeah all right so i was about to talk about this study lowest they did have a big sample size John of over 200,000 but 60, 76,000 people actually completed the questionnaire and everything like that and that's that's the important statistic and of those 76 people who completed the general health examination and went through everything they found that that the and these people all worked out you know these people who exercised there was only they found that there was a tremendous reduction in people who actually got the disease the severity of the disease when they got it and there was almost no death and he was like what like 45 death is something like that of 700 over 700,000 people excuse me 70,000 people sorry oh 76,000 people who fit who actually filled out the uh and went through all the uh the testing which they were able to conclude that you know people who exercise regularly have a much greater chance of number one resisting getting the illness number two recovering very quickly number three and I dying from it and so why they would close gyms now with this data at their disposal um you would think you'd have to be a freaking moron right and the Lewis you want to speak to this you would say they don't care about this dude I mean I said the one from the beginning that exercise was the best vaccine yeah that you could have it's the best way to stop it we've had over we've had over 200,000 people come through my gym week we log every single visitor from last May yeah and that one case has been attributed to our gym we've had someone who was a member of our gym that caught it at a party came to work down here for two days with it didn't spread it to anybody here wow so it the people here just how I haven't gotten it all year and I've been working at gym it you'd think this would be like you know deathcon one yeah yeah very close to everyone right man smerr like we just straight the whole north coast of California here whether the gym being open during a pandemic we the only gym opening in Southern California is crazy but yeah there's people it is this no other explanation for you just healthier look at 78 percent of the people that got put in the ICU either overweight or obese yeah right 78 percent of the people that got put in the ICU they're overweight beasts no one knows no like no like guy with six pack abs working out you know drinking you know green leaf shakes and stuff that's going in the hospital except bill films now there's always one exception you're gonna have people that may have you know other illnesses that we're not even aware of they feel full of Chad fucking COVID yeah yeah but you know what bill was a little overweight you know when he was you know going through this last winter so you know I don't think that's look this is about and the gyms are a prime example to support my my opinion this is the only thing this is about is the vaccine that's all this is about they want it vaccine the world many times over so we're gonna get we made that's why you got that's why you got not one shot but two now they're talking about a booster now you got variants that's gonna require three more vaccines and then then more is that the new variants come out this is the biggest scam in the entire world because there's seven billion people they want all of them vaccinated and this is what a way to fight a war I mean John this is money this is every jab every jab is dollar somebody's making money and the more people they scare and promote and get to get back and the fact that they closed what's first to close the gyms why it's the best place to be listen I don't believe it's just a divine seeing a push in a vaccine so to take it for us you have like proof of vaccine that paper it's a fucking democratic fucking thing in my opinion it's a whole thing on the other side of the track because you're shit yeah wait no money and power go together they're shit in their pants because they know that come fucking the mid-turns there's gonna be trouble a lot of the fucking republicans are free of a red wave all of a sudden now they say to you oh you get vaccinated you know we don't you know get vaccinated you get your freedom now you vaccinate they want to they want proof they want your papers and once you start with papers you need papers to vote right but they want you to go get papers to prove you vaccinated because once you go once you they get those papers it's gonna be like fucking that's how socialism starts show me a paper you can't do this show me a paper you're in New York there's certain restaurants you can't go to unless you show your paper you can't go to the gym now Greg there unless you have a vaccination do you know that's horrible to move these around you know I go to the gym I go to the gym you're vaccinated that's all that that that rigged oh I had no choice because my sister is really really sick and you know she's got stage 4 kids but she's had it before you're in and out of the hospital she said it's 20 20 hour surgery in June and she's got to have another surgery in two weeks here so I had to go I even made a video put on my Instagram I had they would not let me in that hospital to see my sister if I didn't so I'm sorry I'm not a I'm not a person it's for the vaccine but to see my sister and make sure to you know I could do what I got to do with the hospital man I got to do it and you said come to the the political practice if they told you do it you're kidding you're a Democrat you're a Democrat you fell victim to the demands that they're putting you know you have me by the ball everyone has a choice everyone my course not well it's when it comes to my family I came my family comes I'll take that job that's how they get I'm gonna get vaccinated they know that you know I tell everybody you don't understand if you don't you know I had to get a whole video I'm not for the vaccine but they had me by the balls I'm not gonna not I'm not gonna not see my sister my sister is you know very sick you know very you have no idea it's a whole lot of stuff but we could not we could not get into the hospital there demand was because my first one my sister's already been in a unit where even before they would say were COVID you had to wear like a fucking hazmat suit you had to wear the mask you had to wear you know who she has a very rare can so if you have all that equipment on why doesn't matter if you're vaccinated I'd tattooed I say that's what I say but they won't be able to see but see the vaccine is supposed to protect you from yeah the disease not there's no you know what it is right no they're trying to say that I could be a carrier you're still a carrier even though you have the vaccine that's what they found so the vaccine is relevant yeah I really get a relevant argument that what I'm saying is that they will if my sister gets any kind of like the slightest little thing she could you can still give a door even that being vaccinated I know I'm just telling you what they're telling me we're talking about the hypocrisy of these idiots they're telling people to get a vaccine that doesn't even prevent you from giving the disease to someone else I know I agree with and I notice people watching this right now about you do the fact yeah I did because of my family I had no choice either I don't go to see my sister what body the virus is not going to be that great what body will they won't get the vaccine because they want to go to the gym so you know I know people that they ran to get the vaccine when they found that they weren't going to be able to go to the gym I'm not going to mention names but I don't believe I don't believe I believe there are some people just people died from taking fucking you know a bad shot of something you know I mean all I know is my friends who's a fat fuck you know they he had a he has a defibrillator in his heart he has a fucking who he's got all kinds of shit you have no idea and he fucking took the goddamn you know the guy that she has gained fake did the game face yeah he he fucking he took the fucking Johnson and Johnson and nothing happened to him so I said if I get a take a vaccine that's where I'm going to take is if he fucking survived that shit and got no fucking you know I mean JJ yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no but you know what I'm saying I didn't I'm against this and I'm not for the vaccine but I had no choice either that I don't see my sister and I'm not going to go well fuck you I'm not going to see my sister that you know and I'm not going to do that you know what I mean I said well that's what it takes I'll take a bullet if it was to save our life you know what I mean well that's what I got to that's how I get to get everyone it's funny when they first came out they didn't have enough vaccines people were killing each other to get the vaccine now they have so many they don't want to do it I'm they're paying you they're giving you free fucking uh uh oil paper rolls if you go to the CBS you're here and you're gonna get a 100 they got a hundred dollar bribe and some cities to go get a back to the E do you look this psycho here this psycho I'm in the city everybody's wearing a mask it's fucking I don't wear a mask I don't fuck away the mask at all you ever you know how to go in the hospital you know when it goes to the hospital see or after we had a mask they make you wear the mask they give you the mask to wear and as soon as I come out in that fucking hospital the minute step out the door is fucking boom I get rid of it but everybody and he looked at you like like you're like fucking Satan you know because it's so they're so fucking liberal here it's it's sick you know what I mean I've had wars with people in it in fucking Walmart it's shit you know I chased that one fucking guy in Walmart who argue in Johnny I'll cause he's telling me my nose was out of the mask it's gonna just back when the outerwear gonna be a woman you know and my nose was out he's telling me plowing up you know you know you know you know you know you know I told them fuck you we were we had a big argument I chased them down the island you ran I'm just saying I can you know got to do what you got to do you imagine Greg chasing someone at the supermarket dude I was so loud you don't you I was I was trying to fuck bombs and everything it's for every I didn't shit yeah I was just a fucking 20-year-old fucking 20-year-old just chasing some guy I'm gonna be chasing you I'm gonna really hear an oil girlfriend should have lose it bro you really hear an oil you want to really hear an oil you should have heard you argument I had it might be gonna get I just I'm gonna tell you the whole fuck I know you remember it because I was buying uh light sauce right now two light sauce yeah and his black chick across for me in Walmart had a big big basket of them and uh they're good with the this is back when the virus first shit bullshit started and if fucking store managed he's done not the only kid to he get to that's the he's got to he's got to he's got to that's it you can only get two light sauce that's you know because they were rationing and it's because psychos of buying all the time and it black the black lady goes fuck that shit if I was white you wouldn't be doing this and all this other shit so I told her I am so sick of fucking hearing that I got to fucking light sauce you got to I think I told you that you told me I would have took the two lights on gave it to the woman yeah I remember you telling me you know what you should have done is you should have taken one of the light sauce and popped the cap off it get through a little bit lighter in one hand and it's sprayed the shit in a great way I should have just sprayed a I could just spray it or say look it kills germs that you dead I turn it in bro are you ever doing that yeah of course we're a soul but you know a lot of people a lot of people are buying up multiple of them reselling them though they weren't even hoarding it and reselling but because but it's white privilege you know she started that shit and I don't want to hear that we started having that big one I already told you that's the guy but then I got you know I don't want to hear that shit you know I mean she didn't I don't think she believed that she just wanted to get the light so that's all you know that's the point at me and shit like you know I don't want to hear that she just wanted the light so it was a good it was a can't excuse that but so Lewis what so what's you said you're the only gym open what how you keep in the world we were we were the only gym open never gyms open now I'm here for about three to five months last year we were like the only gym open in North County and how did you know what's the name of your gym Metro flex oh shit a Metro okay what what are you hoping is it oceans are yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so you're saying there you go okay yeah so you we just we just stayed we we just stayed open to call the you know took all the hits on the chin and we fought uh we fought the fines and the citations and we beat him oh you beat all those citations yeah we bought we had about 13 criminal charges did you try it all yourself no I don't I don't really kick I got a kick ass lawyer that's specialized in that catcher and she found every loophole you can find in the you know the reason we stayed open is because the people that wrote the executive order out here were not lawyers they were just they're just politicians so we actually said that uh we had a physical therapist right prescriptions preventative work out prescriptions for all of our 1500 members and that people were not working out inside they're doing physical therapy oh that's all I mean say well as the physical therapist with each person through the thing I said well the executive order is to say the physical therapist has to be present just that physical therapy is a good reason being side so we were allowed to be fully open with that tactic oh you are that's all I was like that was not really smart yeah I love it now what do you do in terms of just keeping open her you know beat nose loopholes was with what other kind of you know that was that was the biggest one and that another one they said if you had a uh the way they worded it they said no indoor training will be allowed but you have an outdoor training area then you could have indoor with modifications so that's very big so when they asked me like how are you gonna do or I'm like well my indoor modifications I I modified it with spray bottles I have signs to say X year don't stand here I put some blue tape on the ground and they're like well those are those are that's not the modifications we're talking about I mean again it's not in the order you got very clear that's not my fault I didn't write it haha these very slowly that's awesome so we we basically closed I we closed on this first two weeks obviously like everyone else didn't they made for like the month of April then we realized this BS and they didn't know plan to reopen California they had no idea what they're gonna do and gyms were like they were we were the only thing more dangerous in California than a gym was a basket and like they didn't listen it they're like my spit at concert was level 10 and level down was gyms and it was like I did shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot I shoot into the nine so yeah my spit is back along really good uh I heard big ladies apartment was number nine number eight you know it's funny those because you I've been fighting the good fighting and you know we had to have a couple times around the news and you do a lot of light and you can ran from mayor out there you know what what was the public consensus do you notice you have a lot more members than you gym now yeah we more than since we started we've tripled our membership here and yeah I'm still in the news I get they come on interview me pretty much every time there's a new thing like LA County is getting ready to do a vaccine passport to vaccine mandates or businesses yeah it's about two weeks away but it's coming and I think that whole thing is it's coming down the pipeline for a lot of blue states you know people in Florida and Texas obviously you guys really have to worry about that but uh there's a lot of other of us who you have to deal with that you know wait so I still wait a second please clarify is it are they talking about all business it or just government or just so yeah so a California the way it is right now if you're a health care worker if you are a government worker a government flea or state employee whatever you have to get a vaccine by I think it's September 15 if you don't have a vaccine then and you don't have an exemption you're fired and then they're still so now they're talking about wanting to enforce businesses so but business is letting people live without a vaccine and proving they have a vaccine the business can get fine the business ought to get arrested and that's what I'm talking about in just at this uh Los Angeles County Los Angeles all businesses you can't go to the grocery store without a vaccine because right so if it's the indoor business gotta show you papers like that that's what it's gonna happen yeah papers yeah we went to weeks to show me your papers like uh that's not so germany the Jews had a good day yeah but once you start to get it if vaccines used to be getting once he stole our papers you're gonna have to have to you realize how many people are gonna start selling fake uh back you mean you're going to be selling going to be selling you they probably said they're all right so what do you want me you know I'm sorry I've been offered him twice so far how much free oh oh because it cause it's because I'm I'm the advocate but I mean you know I'm sure they get a couple hundred bucks for him yeah yeah well didn't want to stop monitoring your car and where you go at your car and oh can you hear all this shit did you see the drone the drone with the cameras on it that meant measure how far ahead the way you are from each other and the facial recognition and if you're closer than six feet they can recognize who you are and send you a fine oh my god where's this we call for you how really yeah California has a gas tax where they're trying to pass it where your your tax on how many miles you drive and every car will have to have a sensor put in it and it turns how many miles and it's two cents a mile gas tax why and if you don't get the if you don't get the sensor put your car it's like an automatic find them like $400 for the year how much is it going to guess no I'm just gonna do something I hear it's about like four bucks oh frunk that's a lot yeah for it's four bucks yeah it's it's rape out here man but on the vaccines and the vaccines you're talking about the vaccines kind of everyone third dose fourth dose Canada if you follow the Canada right now Trudeau signed a deal of Pfizer over three years to bring in 33 million or 36 million doses of the fibers of vaccine each year there's only a 30 million people in Canada and he's got this man doses already three years planned out a contract delivered that many doses they're not planning on this just to go away they want this thing to be scheduled for a long term anything it's just Canada it has this plan yeah Biden's got this plan he's got three ways here baby this is I'm telling it's good to be a good one in my words this is all about the vaccine there's nothing else that matters it's a good one why why it's a good one give him a call we're giving you one every time every time somebody gets a shot somebody's getting paid these are not how much okay if they're free to you but somebody's paying for it big form has the biggest most powerful lobby in the entire country there are the ones who are constructing this so that there's many people as humanly possible can buy the vaccine or be compensated they can be compensated it's like a partnership between the government who gets to track everyone and then the vaccine people who make the money that's a part of people elected you know so it's like it's all it is that's only the money it's a election everything else is a conspiracy the only thing that you can follow is the money yeah and the money goes to the big pharma who spreads it around to their lobbyists who spread it around to the government officials and everybody so all of that comes down to how many vaccines can we cram down the public's throat because everyone is a dollar sign and that's all the vaccine is also a tool this whole COVID is a tool that's what they use to win the election it's vaccinated so they think it's a bad luck let me ask how many schools that raised the golden egg go let me ask those to let's say they make a mandate that you have to you get to check people's passport to get into your gym to see if the vaccine you're going to you're going to hear to that are you going to let anyone in no man I'm sorry that one of the news I think last Friday and I said you check my Instagram I put the video up no no that I've never had a mask mandate in my gym is optional I'm all about choice I'm not against being able to get the vaccine I'm all for it don't get it you know but it's about a choice I should not be forced upon someone and I'm not going to put a thing in my gym where I check your status or ask me questions we're big boys and big girls this is not a point of mandate but personal responsibility you know this is like a poll wash your hands don't come somewhere if you sick yeah you know don't play with your faces suck on your fingers and you know touch everything it's this is this is this is big boy big girl stop here this isn't rocket science yeah I could have back to when you were a kid when you were a kid if you had a brother or sister or neighbor sick you mother told you stay away from your brother he's not feeling like you're fingers out of your mouth you fuck you you you don't put healthy people you know in quarantine you quarantine sick people okay even in the that's how they got through the back in 1917 18 over there when you know with the Spanish food that's how they did it you quarantine the sick people you don't quarantine healthy people as a matter of fact that's how you get hurt immunity but they're using this to regain power yes to vaccine to make a money off the vaccine every shot they make money but this is they found the goose now that lays the golden egg that's you keep them in power to keep that getting vaccines to keep you know doing these things to you want to fucking make you pay a charge for fucking every mile you go on your car so eventually go to an electric car they want to do a wave of fucking gas they want to make it so expensive you can't afford it you say okay I give up I got to drive the fucking electric car you know what I'm saying and what it will be the it'll be the car that just picks you up the the the the manless car you know the the bet sounds horrible you know that would pizza now with dominoes is delivered when you're with those are they really yeah drive drive of this car yeah it's an experiment yeah yeah they're told right it's all some kids run over by one and then that'll be the end of the experiment you know you know how in Miami the the the club guys would get you know the the signs on the road with the lights to tell you you know caution whatever's gone so some club dude that worked for one of the DJs would would hijack those signs and he would say like you know victim Martinez is that you know you know you're trying to say you're gonna have that there you got a title pulled one up right there that I can't believe that's cool I bet they probably have a better the probably get your order right a lot more times than when they have the people bring the the orders to the door that's for sure by why so it's something we ordered dominoes by why puts on a man of what's on the thing you don't leave it front door because you know like usually she's upstairs doing some cardio with the kids you know the bounce we have a little bounce house

really you can't really interact with it it's like everyone's just like walking around like in this like little and they're all little world it's the weirdest like uh most anti social type of thing experience you know and everybody looks at you like your piece of shit too well like you got like the biggest like you have virus written on your face everybody you haven't noticed that people look at you like you know I've had people 6 feet 6 feet 5 feet where you go down the wrong aisle with the fucking arrows go this way and you're walking up the aisle that way I think at arrows they don't have

the door you know you might be a one a lose five six hundred pounds between the two of you they don't worry about coming I'll tell you what they usually when I go to those buffets I see a lot of those people there usually they head for the bathroom first about halfway through it half time to kind of unload a little bit you know and then they come back and they'll they'll go fuck piss you me off

was a good place yeah yeah yeah I'm talking about the Fort Laura del I'm sorry you always stop there so so you guys don't notice but Gavin right now is in a spot of the country that probably has the best weather anywhere in the world right absolutely yeah am I right yeah my gyms about five blocks in the beach too so we just walked down to the ocean anytime we want to use about 70 degrees in the water and that was cooler it's crazy say yeah every time every time I think it's hot like five days more like oh no we're dying and you get a constant breeze all day long which is no bugs John they have no it's like my my daughter's grandparents lived in San Clemente you know is going down every week and the to pick them up when I lived in LA and it was just then I got to live in San Diego for a couple years that was paradise yeah we just we just bought a house up on a hill you know this that which is one time over from ocean side and we kind of look out over the whole valley and it's we get the huge breeze and it's open our doors and windows up and just you're right through the house and it's great and it's a great and I don't know I'm not really supposed to say but you have a new addition coming right yeah yeah we have a baby Murphy baby Murphy's coming uh little girl congratulations you guys been trying it's awesome yeah it's been it's been a journey and we're just very very grateful to God and for everything he's given us and uh yeah so it's super I'm super excited I can't wait it's coming up and about to over be you know number of she'll be here so how old are you now I am forty I'll be forty seven but it's on you're like me you started late your late starter but you know it's better that way I'm telling you seriously so this is your first yeah it's our first yeah yeah yeah your first congratulations both yeah I know I'm we're super stoked to you know we're probably gonna head of home schooling arcade or bringing it to like a private academy just because all the BS is going on the schools out here it's horrible out here man the school is you know what I'm learning critical race theory and three years oh you can choose to be a boy or a girl if you want to you know 85 gender's and when they're five years old you want a sexual reassignment surgery we can do that we don't have to tell your parents so you got a trade you mean you got a trade off when you want to live in California you get the weather or the looted in the looted takes and you got to like balance that's right because well we got we got gabanuts and we got a recall that's been coming up the summer 15 Chroma was just resigned today yeah so and then we got you know if we get news about that's like the two coastal just tyranny what just Larry elders is running yeah I was just gonna ask you who I like Larry Elder who would you say is the leot who do you I like the loose I get Lewis Lewis here Adele for governor yeah basically you had to beat out he'd have to beat out Caitlyn Jenner in the primary good honestly what would you vote I who do you think's gonna win that you have a right now whoever whoever is the conservative with the highest high-ess power right now it's Larry Elder so if he's still in the lead that's why I'm looking for the one is in the best chance right now I could I could get a rock with crap all right it's gonna do a better job so I'm surprised Arnold they step back in and try to write it on Arnold fuck that fuck that Gavin do you ever wonder you know how does the guy like that Newsom get to have that much power money and and continually fuck up to the degree that he has and just stays there why are the people in California so complacent with this with this please got huge backing from when he was young he was supposed to yeah yeah but I ask Gavin these are he is Nancy Pelosi Nancy Pelosi's nephew he comes he comes to Matt stock he's got a lot of money behind him the state legislator out here is like 85 Democrats like 12 Republicans so nothing to say legislature yeah it's it's it's up it's up seen and he has the one man role so once the state of emergency is putting a place he saw just cracking out these executive orders and some is executive orders more so crazy so the biggest one he passed was if you know if you catch COVID and you're an employee in order to in order to get a workman's cupcakes against your your boss you have to prove you got sick at work you know that they did something wrong do that he's not so he switched it now so if you're to play and you get sick at work you automatically get if you get sick anytime you get sick at home you automatically get a workman's cop plane against your employer and the employer has to prove they do everything right so all the businesses out here requiring everyone to wear masks limiting capacity because they do not want to get these workman cop suits when the worker is got so we try to get hey we open your business I can't because I get workman cop suits so get sick you know take masks off in your store I can't and we're about to get to sue workman's cop so that's what new some did he passed that he passed the rent more chorium so everyone out here there's renting a regular citizen is renting they don't pay their rent but all the commercial property owners still have to pay their mortgages to to the bank so that these mortgages people that on the buildings are going bankrupt and people are living for free still collecting their $4,000 unemployment checks wow terrible that's crazy so he stays in office because he's because of the handout basically he stays at office because people hear idiots in their democrats and they'll vote you know blue no matter who yeah a lot of the other public is out here you know they're they're proper the proper people they play by the rules you know we got to play by the rules guys now a lot of people are pissed off a lot of business owners that would have blue before are coming out and saying they'll never blow blue again because that's what closer businesses now right so there's a huge shift out here towards towards not blue you know people are looking for what we're voting right so they can get a guy like Larry elder who isn't really a political icon he's not like a Donald Trump where he's got a lot of people that dislike him he's someone that's kind of a likable guy you know he's black and we should big audience and it's someone that can really kind of bring people together where you can get elected and then he can start shifting things out here and everybody loves him I love Larry I'm here to tell you who's gonna take over for promo now in New York the lieutenant governor for now and then they're gonna have to have a little like yeah you know who the T.C. James wants that fucking position it's supposedly that was also a political shit don't get too shit about well she just wants power that's which she's bad well she's bad watch her get watch her fucking win governor next time this contest dates fucked up New York's really fucked this is fucked up this California we're both fucked when are you leaving right I can't leave yet I'd love to leave one day but that would give me him and Jimmy to bull are gonna have like an entomine you know next to Ryker's island and they're gonna they're gonna stay there you know like the movies are rock they're gonna set up yeah in the service missiles you know from there no there's a little island out there by Ryker's you know it's a little deserted like a rock and they're gonna go there and they're gonna put like sandbags you know like the resoul of the earth you know and there's a lot of that we're not gonna be there country yeah and fucking nobody's coming in and they're gonna have the Rajol and and sausage and peppers on Jimmy all the barbecue and you know they're gonna have drone delivery pizza Jimmy likes to bull and A sauce that when we go out beef you like the boy you like the bull and A yeah we're gonna get that shit on the rock over here oh make it just did this to J ever join us to have the game of join this to do he's training I actually had a big landing video but I'm not gonna plow save it for next time stay safe wait Gavin Gavin let's get your let's get your a view of the big landing Mr. G fuck you keep calling him Gavin it's Lewis yeah you go Gavin whatever he goes by Gavin I go by what a call the big sexy too much of a go to his head right now I want to fucking roll a joint just look at So what am I coming out Larry fighting somebody big landing but you haven't been following the big landing Mr. G the buckle oh I have not any good for him I guess I've been I've been wrapped up in California yeah I guess we've been running in this and having to try to keep his gym opening like all of the Mr. G and Lenny saga what a big nation having that Lewis is Jim seems like anything goes yeah we should find a loophole for it you know that would be awesome hey at least we got to talk about it one more fucking time there you go Lewis to set up a ring and his it is parking lot man they could fight right there actually we should have a bros versus pro bro bro bros versus pros protest yeah I have a few games just to get into door you gotta be able to say it three times fast well I like that Lewis I'm uh thank you for joining us today and of course keep the keep going with the good fight out there because yeah you're doing it right and hopefully everyone will flock to your gym because you're obviously doing the right thing out there and of course congratulations to you in Sabrina on the new baby coming soon and congratulations Lewis God bless you guys congratulations that's awesome keep us up with all the new data we have now showing that if you exercise in a regular basis no one has an excuse not to go to the gym so absolutely absolutely and you go that's what I'm gonna do yeah that's the best thing Gavin that baby you watch your life's gonna be like oh my god you want to be sleeping anymore Lewis let me tell you I don't think you're gonna sleep in my sick three hours a night what are you gonna take those three hours away from you I'm not gonna laugh believe me yes you got nothing coming Lewis you said it's a baby girl it's a little girl yeah it's a little baby girl don't bless her yeah yeah that's me great yeah that's me great yeah ready to get your heart broken next you ready to get a little brother next Miss Olympia yes getting keep it out of body all right guys hey thanks for having all guys you all right guys we're gonna wrap this up Lewis we'll see you to keep us updated and Greg stay out of the the vaccination halls all right no more vaccine field John go light a joint and I'll just wish everyone a Merry Christmas and happy new year we'll see you next time thank you love you guys man thank you guys bye bye
