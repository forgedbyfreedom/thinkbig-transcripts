Brian held a brand with our exmuscle.com here with the frame carry and farmers walk medley and your palmers are winter. You just eat down a win over Mike Burke. Yeah by a split second we've had several medley in the last few contests where we've been just tens of a second apart. So you're training in Seattle. There's a big strong man community because Jesse Maroonie being from there and you're training out of a power lifting gym. Yeah mostly a power lifting gym in downtown. So yeah beautiful. It rattles my home and I can understand why you live there because it's a beautiful place. What's the next event? The next event is Conan's wheel. So I've the one we walk in a circle within the crooked arm. So about 800 pounds I understand. I've been told 700 I've been told 800. I'm expecting it to be about 800 in hand. Mike brought it up earlier. He said it was going to be about the girls from MHP coming over about 800 pounds. So he said it is a 1-800 pound girl or several girls are going to equally 800. I honestly don't have an answer to that. I assume I think they were going to have a motorcycle before it didn't fit. So they're just loading a bunch of random weights and bricks and cakes in there. We'll see what happens. Throw girls on their make-and-event. Those are going to sit on top of their way. So we'll find out. Perfect. Good luck next in the next event. Until then, Brian Hill, the Brand with ourXMuscle.com.
