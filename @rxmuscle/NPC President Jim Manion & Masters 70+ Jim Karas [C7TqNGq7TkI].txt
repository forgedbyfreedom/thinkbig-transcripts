This is Dave Palombo with RXMuscle.com. I'm here at the 2011 NPC Master's Nationals. I am here with two gyms that have a very special significance here in this scheme of things. With NPC President Jim Manion here and seven year old Jim Carrus, who just got off stage. Is it true that you guys competed against each other back in the day? Absolutely. Both of them are still sitting guys. Both from Pittsburgh? Yes. Both in the Mr. Pittsburgh. No. From what I understand, who has the most wins between the two of you had to head competition? Well, I stayed in it longer than him. Well, I'm saying head to head. When you guys went up against Chau-The-Mano, who won the most times? I can't remember. He was a big cheese whenever I come in there and he was beat me all the time. Then I start beating him and then we go back and forth. Now, I heard that there was a show called the Super Pittsburgh Devil, former Pittsburgh champions. And I heard you won Jim. I did. I did. Was that 70, what? Five, six, four. 75 or six. I can't remember. Was that the year you went on that streak? Were you one? No. That was 71. How many shows did you win against consecutively? Four and one month. We started with show every week somewhere. How many shows? Every week. We went to Pittsburgh, Catanning, what was the other one? Pittsburgh, Boys Club, Golden Triangle, Wednesday. And we had Eerie, Ray Lakes or something like that. Yeah. What do you think when you hear these guys complaining about doing one show now? They can't pick for a second show a week later. Oh my gosh. We used to pick three times a month. Oh yeah. Three, four, five, a month. It was fun to buy it. After we all competed, we all went on head beers together. Wasn't like life and death. And it was fun. Everybody did their thing. And I was at some point stopped competing. What year was that? I stopped competing. I got a game in 73, and we came back for the 75, 76, Uber Pittsburgh. And then you were sorry to have to do that? Yeah. And when did you take any breaks? Yeah. Did you take any breaks in the action? 1981, I won the over 40 America, the NDBA Cat Test show up in you to go to New York. Wow. We never heard of that show. And I give it up till 1991 and I turn 50, and I told my wife. I said like they have a, I have, I have I need to go again. She says, go ahead and do it. So I did three shows in a six week period. I won the Space Coast, South Eastern USA, and the Southern States. And I said, you know what? I like to do the nationals again. So 1992, I went to Palm Beach and won the over 50 national. Wow. When you see him up there, Jim on stage, you say to yourself, man, I can't believe he's still going. No, I can't believe him. If I didn't know, he just like when Diffson Derexson is mine, did. I got married a little bit young and so I had other responsibilities. But I made kept going to who knows. I still train all the time. I just think you can make a comeback against this guy in the States. When they went. No, no. I don't have to discipline the diet anymore. You couldn't, you wouldn't get up there against this guy. No, not at all. Just the two of you. In a real dark room, maybe. Three years to catch up to me. He's on the 67. Are you going to keep going? No. This is my last one. Do you believe him? No. He said that about five, six years ago. I want him to come back. I got to come back. Keep going. What are you quitting for? That's what people ask me if I'm going to be tired being president and PC. I go, no, what for? Where am I going to do? Travel around. I do that now. You retire when you die, right? That's it. Guys, thank you very much. Okay, day. First, fathers of body building in Pittsburgh. Jim Manion, Jim Carrus. Okay, Jim. Together again. Here in Pittsburgh. You're now. Good job. Good job. Day, Palombo. RXMOSL.COM.
