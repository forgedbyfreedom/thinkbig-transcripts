We're showing it from every, you know, on every man perspective. Every man perspective now are they all movies about people with muscles? No, actually none of them are about people with movies with muscles. It's about like the same stuff where we actually did the best movies of 2011. That was our last show. So we're kind of like the, imagine the Oscars with a lot more muscles. Listen, it's not so man with brains. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Here we are. I, you've started this on your own or did your father tell you to. My father. He's a real man. Just like me. And he told me, son, go out and make something for yourself. Oh, my God. That's what I do.

Here we are. John Hanson here at Saringman. It's over for the night. The Oscars are over. This was a long night, John. We got here at like, around six. It's almost midnight now. Yeah. It's been long. I'm ready to go. But before we go, we have to announce who won. All right. And John, since John got almost every single one of these right. He predicted almost literally every single one of them. I mean, like, John go ahead and run them off for us. John. All right. We got a best picture was the artist, which I was right on. And you'd like to see your right. Because you're gonna be right on all of it. Was right on that one? Right on that one? Best actor was John Desarcan, who was in the artist. Best actress was Merrill Streep. Big upset. Everybody thought Viola Day was gonna win. But you thought Viola Day was the one. That was your one. One of the ones that the Merrill Streep won. Best supporting actor was Christopher Flummer from the beginners. Best supporting actress was Octavia Spencer from the help. Best director was Michael Hasenema, whatever. Right. He's from the artist. Best original screenplay was Midnight in Paris. And a adapted screenplay was the descendants. Is that all you want to know? Yeah. I mean, that's the main stuff. Everything else is kind of like in significant. All right. Right. The funny thing John is, we didn't actually review a few of these movies. There's a few that we didn't talk about. The beginners for one. Yeah. We reviewed almost every single one of them. But the beginners, what other ones we didn't review? Uh, you go. We didn't review. You go in. You don't want a lot of, um, like special effects of what? I didn't see any of the cartoon movies this year to you. No, I didn't either. I don't live kids. So, you'll be seeing them pretty soon though. You'll be going all the way through. Yeah. I might send Daryl to that one. I'll go to the other theater and kind of meet her back after. All right. All right. So this was fun. This was fun. We had a few drinks. We did the limo ride. All right. You know, all in all. I hope you guys enjoyed the video. The first part was the first silent movie to win since the first Oscars back in 1929. That's pretty unbelievable. That throughout this whole period from then to now, they never had another silent movie that won. They actually said, I was, I know you told me way away before that there would not be moneyball. But moneyball, if it were the one, would have been the first movie ever about baseball to when I was. Right. So, I thought the moneyball was the best movie of the year. But that was your favorite. That was your number. My favorite. Yeah. But the artist was good. I'm glad that got some recognition. Well, for John Hansen, Aaron Seringon, Muscle at the Movies, we're out.
