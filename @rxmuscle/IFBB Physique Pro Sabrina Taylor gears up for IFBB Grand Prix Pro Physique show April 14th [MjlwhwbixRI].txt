=== I'm a fan of them to wear The golden face I can't you pop my hair I'm a little thought Still being shy, still being shy I'm a little thought I'm a little bit cut and cut I love me, I want to see you being shy Still being shy I'm a little thought I'm a little bit hurt I want to be her I'm a little bit hurt Let the party ride Put your ears on Everybody just dance We can't divide rocks Fashion is like my own heart They call me real food I walk in the front of the bottle Shake it split on the body too The world got the party with me You too, oh I'm gonna get you wet I'm gonna make you sweat I like you all forget She's being shy, still being shy I'm a little bit cut and cut I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt Let the party ride I got so stuck in the room Scab with a breath full and go Get a bottle I got run nights on the note And it's about to be a champagne My soul Baby girl, you look legit Come to my table and take a sip Open wide cause we're sprayin' Fixing bottles ain't paid for seeing it I'm gonna get you wet I'm gonna make you sweat I like you all forget No, I'm gonna get you wet I'm gonna get you wet I got you all forget She's being shy, still being shy I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt I'm a little bit hurt She's being shy, still being shy I'm a little bit hurt I'm gonna get you wet I'm a little bit hurt Why do you beat the old? Now I want you to grab your bottle What a bottle Now take a sip Check that bottle, let me make it! Check that bottle, let me make it! Check that bottle, let me make it! Check that bottle, let me make it!
