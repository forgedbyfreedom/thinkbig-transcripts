Day 2 655 Breing, held in Remember UXMSAL.com. here, the America Strongest Man Day 2 and Hot Springs Arkansas Travis Ord, my winner, not only twice yesterday, but you want to get today the kick toss first event. Hey, I guess it's a good start today too. I, you know, wanted at least three events yesterday, so I'm going to go for all four to make up for it today. You got the push pole medley coming up next. It looks brutal. Yeah, that's five events, you know, cleaner press than deadlift, so it's an upper body and then a lower body and just that up and down is just going to be absolutely a killer. Good, all right. Well, go get warmed up and hopefully we'll see you here after this next event. It's Bryan Heldibra with ourXMuscle.com.
