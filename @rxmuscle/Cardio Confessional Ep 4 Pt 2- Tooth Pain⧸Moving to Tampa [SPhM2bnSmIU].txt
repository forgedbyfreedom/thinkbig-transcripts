All right folks this is cardio confession number four part two and I've got my little headphones at home for me to speak into so we're gonna hear a lot of background noise but I'm not gonna be the longest one I'm gonna do one tomorrow also in the morning before I leave town I am leaving town moving from Houston Texas to Tampa Bay Florida moving or to move together with my girlfriend Darial Gaines we ran a really nice house three bedrooms we got a pool and everything a huge yard with a dog it's like almost an acre maybe even a whole acre I'm very excited about moving but I'm also excited about the amount of progress I'm lately I am basically right now sitting at almost exactly my contest suite from last show and I've been doing what Jasmine's telling me I'm doing my cardio and dieting but if anything I've been eating less but I'm supposed to and that's because of the truth pain now we're not on anybody out there has had severe tooth pain before let me tell you it is totally all encompassing and debilitating you really can't do anything when your teeth are really really hurting like full bone pain it makes it difficult to drive to talk you can't sleep you certainly can't eat or drink any liquids would actually hurt my teeth works so I did give a gym and do what I needed to do but I didn't eat everything I was supposed to I had more egg whites than usual less meat than usual and as a result I really I mean I'm totally vibrate now I'm very lean I'm basically as I was with our last show but I'm six weeks out the goal we're tired I'm to see tad in Vegas and the goal for me in tad is to be in contest shape in the at the Olympia in Vegas so that you can see exactly how I look and then I can kind of coast because next two weeks I'll be in obviously Vegas for the Olympia then I'll be going straight from the Olympia in Vegas to days house Columbus house in New York where I'm going to work on some TD stuff kind of do whatever work we need to do and then I'm going right from there from New York airport straight to India to Mumbai or six days so it's gonna be busy and obviously I'm not going to be able to do 70 minutes of cardio every day and eat exactly right to be honest with you I don't think that I should I think I could really honestly probably lose another 20 pounds easily at this rate in the next six weeks because I'm almost losing a pound of day again and I'm way way less than I was losing a losing a pound of day when I was 260 so this isn't water I don't know what it is but today I was pretty strong a toothpane is gone I went to the dentist which was something that I had been putting on for years now I've learned my lesson three Rick Nails were necessary for some of you who's pretty much nervous or I'm gonna say I'm afraid of the dentist because that's not the dentist that I'm afraid of I just get anxiety when the people are all over me and putting stuff around their face so they gave me some Microsoft side and I took some Xanx and I played my music really loud I couldn't hear the drill I just zoned out and believe or not it wasn't that bad and in the process of it people will laugh you would expect no less for me I took a video so here's the video of what they're doing I was holding my iPhone out like this and that's how I was doing it so here it is I'll do that see I think of everything we actually have a lot of cool footage I'm gonna shoot a lot of stuff while me and Darryl are moving in and of course I have a big dog Rustyne and I'm gonna introduce my dog to her cat the match of the interest thing is Husky I don't know if you guys know there are no but Husky is one of the warnings you got when you get a Husky is they don't like cats or they like chase cats I know for the fact that Rustyne my Husky loves chase cats so we're gonna have to we've looked into this how to introduce them together properly for the most positive outcome so I will I'll definitely video that you should see a lot more cardio professionals to come because I'm gonna start doing a little more regularly and in a little more detail not I actually have somebody to hold the camera to do some stuff there you'll help me make these things a little more interesting so I'm gonna try to get one out tomorrow or at least before one tomorrow my last cardio session my last time in Houston and I'll do something for you guys I
