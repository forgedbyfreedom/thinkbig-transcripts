Music Music um I'm going to take the phone I want to say that this is for me I can play To hate the key Take a good Count free Say that I'm so I'm the one I'm so close Take your kiss I'm the one Say that I'm so close I'm so close I'm the one I'm the one I'm the one I'm so close Take your kiss Say that I'm so close I'm so close Take your kiss I'm so close Take your kiss I'm scared of you I see This is for you I'm so close Take your kiss I'm so close Take your kiss I'm so close Take your kiss I'm so close No, it's not a matter It's for you So just go straight Take a good one Take a good kiss For my heart Don't want to bring your life Never seen you never saw You saw
