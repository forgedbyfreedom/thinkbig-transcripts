Nive for the�RX muscles to your discs... is the heavy muscles無hhh.... with your muscles... Cause you're Neo's Dave um Uncle Century Lump Metal Ax Sh Et meible tube AAAHH Ya dragons Chettles and my friends Welcome back to the episode. It is August 17th, 2011, and we are here at the RX Muscle Studios in Westbury, New York. And I am here with the entire WAC. We have a full studio today with some very, very interesting guests. People coming as far as California into the studios here. It is very special guests sitting to my right here is Juan Diesel Morelle, who was just came off his second place, finished in the super heavyweight class at the USA Championships. Getting ready to the North American to be hired in the studio and do a little posing with the IFB Pro Chris Cormiero. Yeah, awesome. He's a beast. I learned a lot from him and he's told me a lot and you know what we actually spent an hour and a half, but at the USA in a little high-fowler he was able to fix my routine, fix my posing so that night time, he commented on how much better I look, how much better my posing was and it was just a little bit of a half hour. Now in an hour and a half he taught me today a lot of things that I know is going to come and hand he comes to us from now. Isn't it amazing though? You think you know how to do all the work in the gym, you do the diet, and then it comes to something as silly as getting up on stage and posing and it's little details that really make it huge difference. And we're going to talk a lot about this with Chris a little bit later in the show, but I'm happy you're in the studios. I wanted to congratulate you on your second place, finished in the super heavyweight class. And hopefully you'll be coming home on IFB Pro at the North American Championships. Hopefully, God willing, I mean I worked hard for it and I feel that I feel this is going to be my day. September 2nd, I feel like I'm going to be a pro. Give us a little give us an arm shot or something like that so we can show the guys what's going on here. Wow. One morale gate has been gaining steadily 10 to 15 pounds of muscle every single year since I think I met you, which was about four years ago. It's almost incredible when you think about it because a lot of guys can't gain one or two pounds of muscle here. Well you got me eating all the time. You can't just lose. Don't tell the world you've done a lot of unbelievable even. But we have a few more celebrities in the house. We have Jeremy the casting director here. I want to just congratulate you. You had been falling off the cuff a little bit in the last couple weeks. You booked guests, they never showed up. This week, however, we have a full house and you have a special guest coming in from New York City who does explain what she does. Well, her name's Kat and she actually does a little bit of a bunch of things. But she has a DVD out for a... Oh, I want to do a bunch of things. She does sex or size basically. Well, kind of yes. It's exercise for better sex. So she has a DVD. It's functional. Right. And she also trains people. A little on the kinky side. So if you want to get that kind of training going, I'm sure she has a whip or something she could whip you in the shape. She looks right herself. And you guys are going to see that I think she's going to be a good guest. So this is a good, a way to find Kat. Actually, my best friend's dad is her account. So Jeremy always has... So it's like six degrees of Jeremy, the cast. Oh, it's like Kevin Baker. Yeah, he knows everyone's somehow. We got a Jeff to produce with his new haircut over there. Well, you know, again, I can't match this guys because the wind is coming from this direction. It's kind of pushing it that way. Mine, the wind's coming from beneath. So it's going straight up. He's got that like swoopy haircut. I'm trying to think of what Cartoon character has that little swoop. Oh, that's right. The, uh, we're like with the blonde hair, right? There you go. That's it. I'm going to talk with Chris, quite a bit of throwing in from the side lies there. We also, of course, have Magnus Magnificent. Oh, hi, hi. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Now, uh, you have, uh, I wanted to ask you before we start the show officially. My, uh, my earring that I got, my ear that I got pierced and, uh, we had Lisa here from Bill and Sheaware. That's finally healed a little bit. Where I could actually lay on my head. How is your nipple piercing? They got nothing. Payingly once. No, no. Let's give us a little preview. Let's see what it looks like here. Let's perfectly play the main point. Very willing to show my dad. Still there. And you have even doing the, uh, the care. The care. Not that the day for, I think these, uh, alright. It's a little bit more. I'll be more, just. I'm staring at the cat. So, I'm going to be a show. He's not on the other side. He's not on the other side. He's not on the other side. He's not on the other side. Oh, right. Jeff, is that for me? Yeah, no, it's because Chris showed me that if I pose a third of the way, I would flex the deck and such it direction. Why don't I hit the little ghost deck up? Wait, what type of press that Lisa say I had? She took the book was the day she gave it to me. You had that sat nipples. No. I meant, meaning, meaning in the post. It's very cool. It's the meaning of both now. Um, so. You gave me a couple pictures here and you told me that you became a mess that was a, no, that I's made methadist of the day, that they had their eyes. Oh, you were methadist of methadist of methadist. And they had the end. a barbecue and their pastor in Reppent Duan, he's a really cool guy and he said like I'm just making sure that's past the loo and with despite my reading, there were very nice people, there's satinists, they came up with the two years at the church and he's really, really hip and he said I'm going to make you Methodist of the Day and they welcome me, he introduced me to the congregation, he told them that I was writing a book that it's coming out in December, which I thought was all very grateful and they tweeted me with a little like a family, you're very open to religious beliefs because you were, I think a rabbi for a day and that was cool and I've now owned a methadist and I've got a shower, Chris just kicked out that other swamps down, I got a chance to call the little piece of happen which is going to be in my next book and it's that I'm desparking to pick, like it's just a delight for little, what's your next religious expert are you going to become a Muslim for the day? yes and my first assignment, I'm going to blow up America and that's going to be my first assignment I'm going to become a Buddhist, I think that would be cool, it's got might be the Hindu, I can do it, I like that but I'll maybe open to different people, like the types of religious beliefs maybe you should report me, we should send a camera crew with you when you go on these religious beliefs you'll be 72 virtues but I don't care what we're looking at such a distance, long as who you are super excited, you like to festive aspect of the religion, more so than the actual like the Bible says, right in the closet and whatever you have to do that, it's a matter of the way to say, I see the best place to praise the closet because the hypocrites I have, the ifleaching and the minute you hear somebody preaching, you know, they have to create. what do you always say, love thy? they buy, never love thy, enemy, now I know she have this, you've been very excited about this peanuts book here, this is great, now I just want to before you go into what why you have the peanuts book here and probably a lot of our viewers like Pete the intern probably doesn't even know what peanuts is. yeah I do, it's what you eat, you eat peanuts. Peanut's. yeah it's over. Pete's never, he's too young I tell you, this is like from our generation Snoopy and Charlie Brown. I know Snoop Dogg. When I look at this book that this is great. I know it's a library book because I haven't seen a library book and well I didn't know people went to the library anymore because with the book. Oh, I throw it like so, especially you should step up. I'm still busy because I think that people just go online and download books, it's a cult spring hop a lot for every and it has cult spring hop, but that's a 13 million dollar Why did the libraries put those plastic coverings on the books to make sure that they're not far you Dox or cats, so anything like that what it is I got you and what's the what's the our special occasion The 13th of the 16th anniversary and it's a great book and I draw shorts the author the writers Child Shops is the author and I thought it was really cool that he passed away 50 and he was the me out the day he's I guess she learned after 50 years how to do it.
