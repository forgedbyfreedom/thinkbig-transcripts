Dave Palombo here with an RX muscle news update. The IFPB Europa Pro in Aliconti Spain has let out Nathan the Asha has been crowned the champion for Nathan after that horrible year he's had with COVID and his gym shut down and arrests because he wouldn't shut his gym and I mean just all kinds of mishaps Nathan and over the last year this guy has really just been standing up for his right to own a business and basically you know have a life he would and man what nice retrovue to this is he this the Olympia last year couldn't travel and now he is going back to be to one Olympia beating a very good ruling winkler and this was a huge win for Nathan and I think that we have to really take our hats off to what he went through and how great he looked at this show. Really certainly was not the rule that we're used to seeing on stage. There's definitely something that hasn't restored itself if you want. Chris Asita said that he felt they really hadn't really gained back to size that lost over the last year or so that we hadn't seen him on stage and I think that that might be the truth but really look good here and we're going to see some momentary rouls and footage from a website that had some of this event and you know it's thank god for them because there's really not that much out there and if you look it was a two man show essentially here Nathan the Esheroly winkler and through the poses one by one from the front size they're pretty equal you know and I mean it's not like a blowout by any means on Nathan's bucket when they turn around you just see the crispness of Nathan the Esheroly he's glued to handstrings around really really doesn't have that conditioning back in those areas even really his lower back is really not you know outstanding it's got a lot of thicknesses up or back of course but Nathan's got a lot of wow a lot of pop and he can tell that he suffered. He absolutely gained that a lot of muscle that he had lost we had seen Nathan you know lose a couple of shows and not really looked at great the greatest you know about a year and half ago he was competing before this whole COVID thing where that makes it because he rested his body and man that he bounced back he's got those crazy genetics that you know if the Levrony hyper responder type genetics where you always got to just get back in the gym and really focus on what he's doing 100 and that muscle comes back he looks fresher here than really I I think he easily beats really you know it's to every pose obviously this is more for the audience I think and you know a lot of people about third place should have possibly snuck in there but I think really was a solid second thing Nathan was a solid first what's going on with really I don't know I think really might just need another season to really get back to his old form obviously he had some issues as well but you can see Nathan's with here also really works as a fashion and we think of really wayfler is being so crazy wide but at the end of the day you know Nathan is his bigger he's got a bigger structure and I said yesterday you know when I did my wrap up of the Texas prop I wish I could have seen Kouplo come out to see what a fairer against Nathan yes I don't know if he would have been a really good battle because they both have a lot of width and a lot of pop through that physique a lot of wow but the European audience got their money's worth for sure and Nathan the Esher really proves once for all the hey you know what I'm back number one I'm going to the Olympia and I'm going to give these guys a the Olympia and that top six a big run for their money and that's that's a bold statement on his part and I think that you know we've got to add into the list people out there I mean he doesn't really have a lot of weaknesses and when he's when he's sharp like he was here he will be very difficult to beat because of his taper because of his small ways because of his wow he must have roots his arms his shoulders when turns around his back double was really good he's got glutes and hamstrings and everything ties in very nicely and flows nicely and that's important especially on the Olympia stage sometimes guys like Nathan have trouble winning these these smaller shows because sometimes oranges but on that Olympia stage there's a lot of structural guys in that top six and if you don't have structure usually you get ejected immediately so I think that Nathan's going to be a factor and we know this is this too we'll Nathan display something I don't know what is really way to have to do he's got to go back through the drawing board and do what got him there to begin with train heavy have a solid rough season and come back and dominate again but he's got to put that size back on maybe he didn't give himself enough time all I know is that it's been a super exciting weekend for shows we're going to do a full wrap up of all these shows tomorrow with Milo Sars have lied to him that's Monday 12 new Easter Santa time for now I'm Dave Alumbo but then our ex muscle
