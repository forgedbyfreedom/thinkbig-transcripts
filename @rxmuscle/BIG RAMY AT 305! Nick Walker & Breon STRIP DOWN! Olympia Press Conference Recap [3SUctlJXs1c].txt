from the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida day one of the 2021 Olympia weekend glad you can join us on rxmuscle.com alongside the legend Chris Cormier. I'm sitting for Rookie the 2021 Olympia press conference just letting out in Chris. It was a radically different format this time around no longer having 30 athletes just sitting on the stage for a half hour this time they brought everyone out in many groups more like USC boxing a lot more entertaining fans got their money's worth this afternoon. Yeah, I thought it was definitely refreshing being in a 10 of those myself being up there with all the athletes and everyone trying to get their turn at sand something. I thought it was better like you know like a pace off style each one having a microphone type of thing and I thought it was great or you know all the fans loved it I loved it and I think that least loved it themselves and they get to go eat and start their preparation quickly. I know you have to jettle for just a couple of minutes to go to the gym with Breon and Zlee the press conference started with the classic physique guys first they brought out a Breon as well as Terrence Ruffin and eventually they had like a double-edged drop in with Chris Bum said made some entertainment and of course Breon decided to take off his shirt and give the fans a preview. Yeah that was awesome I thought Breon was looking right on the money and I was happy to see that everything we worked on the lower back was tight the as or tight everything's jumping and popping and I'm sure he's and some pancakes in there as we speak right now before we go to the gym. Give us a little insight on Breon obviously she looking to win his title back a title that he is won two times Izzy on track do you see him what is one of the adjustments rather that you and him worked on together to get that title back up back over the top. Well we was just working on just like his glutes are definitely more developed more strided more shape there the lower back we felt was a little bit not as tight as we wanted to be when we came out you know to the show so we worked extra hard there and the poses some just poses the way to Brazilian himself it wasn't even the opening this back I was screaming oh we not open up open up you back last year so you can probably hear me on the on the video saying screaming that but we worked a lot on that and because you know he haven't been competing all that long it's he's been only in a hands-for-the-shows he won probably at 9 or 10 or shows something like that but they were consecutive and there wasn't that many years he started the game later on in life but you know trying to pick up the speed but you know what the pose and like you know when the lights are on with your hunger you tie it you've been dying on his time you know that's when he is on the when you're gonna hit that pose right is everything gonna connect from head to toe that's where it's hard for us to wear a lot of people you had division by division many group after many group and Bob Chickeroa low coming out of trying to do what he does best and that is get some you know ribbing conversation get somebody to explain why they're going to win why they're going to knock off the champion well another one of the highlights of from today was big rami big rami they had a scale on stage they didn't use them much but they did use it for big rami big rami tipping in a 305 of course coming in to the game of thrones winters here the whole music the whole theme keeps on for 2021 yeah I thought that was awesome I thought it was a nice touch they used to have a scale back it was a 1988 with the lihanie you know uh little abrata uh Sean Ray all those guys were in the show I was in attendance I was in the last row the very last row but I bought my own ticket and I made it to my first Olympia and uh I thought it was a great touch I people want to see that they want to I think that you can do you know have it live just like to do the the in the may the you'll see I think you do that and uh it'd be very I think everybody would love that and at the end they had um champions and I guess some of the top competitors come out and essentially explain why they're the best for the heq why they're the best body but uh you know we do close on a touching note and that was when they brought out the two 12's the obvious absence there uh George Petersen they and let's give them credit uh dance Solomon Bob Chicorilla came out in the beginning and addressed the crowd you know uh dance almond also talking about the loss of Peter McGuff earlier in the year yeah I was in my guy right there I call him the silver fox you guys come Peter McGuff but I mean I used to call this guy on a daily basis uh sometimes uh during that four or five o'clock in the morning he still picked up the phone every time uh I love the guy to death when I I said bring my son to to his office and go through all his magazines and tuck shop and he just been really a big part of my life uh the whole time and and uh George Peterson we had a close connection because him and Brigham was going at it pretty good for a lot of uh I did at careers uh three years or so so I got to know him and Justin and I'm yeah my heart goes out to his family to his fans and uh yeah that's tough for the story it was a classy touch by dance almond by Bob Chicorilla by the Olympia committee to recognize Peter McGuff to recognize George Peterson also to recognize John Meadows who just about a year ago we're here at this very spot he helped us with the two 12 wrap up videos so you know again we say from our entire community the our expulsal team the body building community we continue to send our warmest wishes to all of their families but Chris this is going to be an exciting show this upcoming weekend a lot of story lines heading police you're about to go train with Brigham big rommies looking to defend his title what excites you the most about this upcoming weekend oh the competitors the you know seeing him all leading up to this show um they all want to bat the all been training hard uh Nick Walker coming in with his excitement I like I like his attitude like the way he goes forward and uh I mean he's put together the good physique I mean I don't I know a lot of people gave him some slack about how he's put together I like what he's doing I think he's working probably harder than anybody in the sport right now in my opinion he works just as hard as you know Brigham I think is number one but I think he works just as hard and I think he's on a gear around you see him on his Instagram giving the fans of looking to what he's doing all the time uh I think you have the right attitude for uh saying whatever I want to prove you wrong I did the same thing in my career so I like his attitude I'm gonna see him push him straight a title here from the legend himself it all begins tomorrow pre-judging and then the night shows we will have wrap up videos after each session less out tonight meet the Olympians so all the interviews that we're gonna be doing walking around we try to grab as many as we possibly can keep it a lot continuing coverage of Olympia weekend on rxmuscle.com
