Ben Weedor, that was his quested life to put the, well every show we ever saw him talk at the Arnold in the Olympia every year. It was the Olympics and this guy I'm talking to the president and we're getting a send the Asian games and here's the problem. Everyone thinks it's a drug related thing. It's really not because they can do the same random drug tests they do with every sport. I mean, and I'm sure that the athletes that can beat the test and we'll pass the test and I'm sure there are natural athletes that will be able to compete and beat the test because they don't take any drugs. But here's the problem. It's how do you quantify bodybuilding? There's no specific poses and scores. You hit this pose right, you get this many points. Like you do it like San and gymnastics or in ice skating and stuff like that. They don't have a quantify bodybuilding so you can score it. Even the posing around is not scored, which is the one thing that you can actually quantify. They haven't done that and until they do that and they probably won't because I don't think anyone cares about it. You'll never see bodybuilding in the Olympics. I think you have a better chance of getting fitness the fitness division into the Olympics before you would bodybuilding because at least fitness you can score the routine. And once they don't even have a quantify, they used to have a quantify-able scoring system. If they made one, you'd be much more likely to get that one in first. But I don't think the organization has any desire to put it in the Olympics. Once you get it on the auspices of the IOC, the Olympic committee, testing committee. Now they're going to want to drug testing and I don't think our bodybuilding organization wants any part of that. And I don't blame them. It's not worth it. It's not worth opening that can of worms.
