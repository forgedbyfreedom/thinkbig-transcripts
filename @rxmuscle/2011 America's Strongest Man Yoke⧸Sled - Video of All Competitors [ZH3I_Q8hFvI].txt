Brian Hildebrand with OrxMuscle.com. Here with the winners today's second event, the Yoke and Harley Sledpole Travis Orton from my or Travis, 950 pound Yoke is a big pain, how much gas did it take to pull that sled? You know, that was really happy with the Yoke first off. I was probably one of the best runs I've ever had with that. So I saved a lot of energy and the sled actually felt pretty good. You know, it's the secret with that, with a slick floor like this, is to really get a hard start and get the momentum going and fight to keep the momentum, the amount of how bad your legs are burning. Just keep going. I knew you had incredible foot speed in the Yoke and just absolute determination to get through the line, not let that sled stop, which is really a key. Yeah, absolutely. I really had to fight the pain in my leg from that ankle break in my steer, but you suck it up, take the pain and it feels better once you get that first place. Yeah, first place always feels better, right? Always good. All right, well congratulations. Then a good start with the axle today too. How heavy did you go? I got 393, it was should have been my second attempt and I wanted at least 15 pounds more than that, but sometimes you got to take what you can get. So it was a strong press and women heavy today at the axle, which was really great to see for the Americans. Yeah, there was a lot of over 400 attempts and really strong guys, I mean, 363 pounds took last place. So yeah, that says a lot. All right, I'm here again with Travis Sort and my, America's strongest man, 2011 Brian Hilderbrand for rxmuscle.com.
