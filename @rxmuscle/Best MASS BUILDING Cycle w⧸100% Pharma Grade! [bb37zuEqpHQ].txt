I mean, I was getting pharmacy drugs when I was competing in the 90s and for me, a thousand milligrams of testosterone worked really well with like, literally we were using three to 400 milligrams of acropoise a week or four to 500 milligrams of dechiro week, 76 milligrams of trend balloon, which was called parable in back then two or three times a week. And we were building lots of muscle. I was using three to four I used maximum of GH per week, but it was all pharmacy, you know, great stuff. And it worked. And I think a lot of the problems today is that there's two problems. One problem is that people think they need a ridiculous amount of drugs to be huge. The other problem is that the drugs are not dose properly or they're not the actual drugs that people think they're taking. And that's why the the Roy test kits we saw, I sell on my daypalumbo.com website sell so well because people are always testing their products. And unfortunately, a lot of the stuff out there is either nothing or it's cheaper ingredients. In other words, people think they're using trend balloon or they think they're using dacchar and they're actually using test propane. They think they're using anavar that's using dianimal. It's a huge podge of mixed mishmosh out there. And but if you can get pharmacy great stuff and you know your gear is good, you don't need quite as much as people think.
