All right, PJ. So we're here at the Wimpya. We have no shirts on. We're drinking vodka. We bought a file for $100. This is the last shot. It was a very small bottle. We'll show it after. Pour a pour of Jewish business, fine. I do feel a little bit sad that I spent $40 on a bottle that last two pretty sizes. That's a large amount. It's going to be disgusting PJ, but I think we can do it. We've got to start this week and off right. This is how we do Wednesday night in Vegas, right? Ready? Let's do it. You nervous? Oh, okay. Cheers. That was pretty good, right? Should we have a shower? Let's get a shower.
