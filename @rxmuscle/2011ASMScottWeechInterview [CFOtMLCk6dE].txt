We're in Helderman with our ex-Muscle.com. Here in Hot Springs, Arkansas, 2011 World Strongest Man, America Strongest Man. I'm here with Mr. Scott Weach, who won a first event at Axel Cleanup Press and set a new World record. Yeah, it feels good. Don't enjoy it when I second attempt. So I got to say, I'm going to introduce you to the next event. I've always been pretty good at pressing. So, you know, worked out good for me. I knew I needed to start off strong with my best event. So, it turned out good. Yeah, it was terrific. And your toe was forward 23. Is that correct? Yes, there are forward 23. Second attempt. Yeah. Next event coming up is the yoke with the Harley's sled pole. What's your thoughts on that? It's not an event I like. Hopefully, the floor won't be too slick here. It's a finished concrete. Because sometimes we get pretty slick. You pretty good with the yoke. So, it should be another good event for me. All right, looking forward to it. And we're going to be back in just a few minutes to catch up with the next event with the yoke and the Harley's pole. Until then, Brian Helderman with ourxmuscle.com.
