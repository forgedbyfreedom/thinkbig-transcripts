If you want to build lean muscles, you don't want to just go up and down, up and down. You need to consistently consume protein every two to four hours depending on whether your man or woman throughout the day that you're awake. Very important point to make. It's very hard to do that by eating food meals all day long, because who the hell wants to eat six, seven food meals a day? It's the preparation time alone is crazy. So a lot of us rely on protein shakes. And I'm going to tell you something, it's actually a good thing to rely on some protein shakes. The reason being is that food is absorbed in eight grams of protein per hour. What that means is if you eat a meal, if you eat a meal, that has 48 grams of protein in it, it's going to take you six hours to absorb that food meal completely. That's just the way the body works. However, if you would have taken a protein supplement, a protein powder, specifically a way I assume, which is about as pure as it comes. Your body would absorb 48 grams of protein in about 15 minutes, because there's no digestion required of the stuff. It's pretty much an appredigested state. So if we made a graph of blood protein levels and we ate a food meal, we would notice the graph would do this. We would gradually increase it and would stabilize it and it would do this until the meal ran out and it would go down. If you eat a protein shake or if you drink protein shake, I should say you're going to get it's going to spike up immediately up very high and then it's going to come right down. So if you combine your meals to be meal, shake, meal, shake, what you'll have is this gradual rise and then every other meal you'll get this huge spike from your protein shake and you'll always have a high baseline level because there's always going to be food in your body. That's the most efficient way to build muscle and to sustain muscle when you're dieting.
