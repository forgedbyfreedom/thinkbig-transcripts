N quote, You're watching. Mr. Kaye. You're not me. Shit, I've got to break some servers. All right, welcome back from Break. Zach the stone is still here eating. I guess you... How much we did smoke today? Yeah, that was not enough. That ain't smoking. Yes, you did. How much did it? I don't think that's enough. Let's go to our next very special guest. We have a really star-packed show here. We have Chris Quarmear and we have Jimi the Bulls. It luckily graced us with his presence this week. We have to be absent. And we have cat from exercise for better sex. Thank you for coming through the studio. Jeremy found you somewhere in the city through his accountants, brother and lawyer, something like that. And talk to me about what you do. I do fitness for better sex. I've been a trainer for about seven years. And... What do you train people? Right now independently, but I did the whole near sports club, Rribox, but I actually all met Dr. Koo. And now I train with myself independently. And I focus on fitness for better sex because I believe actually, to be honest, having a lot of sex helped me this week. So you believe in sex? So rather than this you believe in functional exercise then? Yes. Also part of the motivation behind it is that I lost a little weight when I started having one of those sex. Now when you saw the new sale a lot of sex, Chris is looking at the nibble that's sticking out of your shirt. So... I'm looking at a breast still. Yeah, help it. No. When you say you've had a... What do you say a lot of sex? What do you define? Because Chris and Jimmy might define that as something different. What would you consider a lot of sex? Oh, gosh. How many times a week? How many times a week? Why not? How many times a week? I'm not asking you how many people you have. I'm not asking you how many times a week. How many times a week? How many times a day? How many times a day? It has changed. I was 31 and I was kind of having weight issues until I was 26 and then I had my big epiphany. And that's when I started having sex. I'll be honest on a daily basis. How many times at one time today? Two times a day? Four times a day. And so times on people were involved. Also you believe in multiple parties then. I don't know if my plan was about. No, I don't know. We have to get back around on you first of all. I didn't spend the whole day. I didn't have a lot of time. Jeremy did a good job. I like to do a lot of research. To be perfectly honest, this down playing against. But I was a big, then-jeer. Like, I used to binge eat every day. It was an uncontrolled until I suddenly became multi-air guys. I was like, start having all kinds of sex. So I did research behind it. There was a big correlation. So you became a being sex person. I don't think I switched addictions. But after about a year or two, you were going crazy at calm down. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit. You said multi-air gazzmic. Yeah. What would define what that means? Because some of our viewers are not that a versed in sex. I especially like Magnus and the sex. I can't. I can't. I can't. Oh, I don't know. Okay. According to Taoist belief men can be multi-agazmic. Well, obviously, I'm a woman. So it's just, it's kind of like a- Chris, you multi-agazmic. Yeah. I used to shoot a bit harder than that. So you say multi-agaz means you can have, or guys is one after the other. Yeah, you're like a roller coaster. And how many can you have in a row? Like, what was your record? I don't really keep calm, but I realized that once I had about 20, I started to... Detired. Yes. Okay. Now, when you say you've had, you like to do different combinations of people. Like, we talking to women, to guys, three guys, three women. I'm doing the good thing. I've been there everything. And that year and a half, two years. You've done every combination. Swing gloves, pink parties. What? I was just gonna, you know, you read my mind. Chris, you guys are both just doing the right thing. You read my mind. I was just gonna, I was just gonna ask that question. I have, for a few times in my life, but to be perfectly honest, I did not feel better than radio orgasm. That's me personally. It looked, it's, it's, it's more visual. If you think about it, Chris, though, you can do a lot of sheets and stuff like that. Yeah, and then it's how old is it? So, the fuck is wrong with that? My best friends were, she gets the whole bed just like... Oh, really? That we should have brought her out. But let's talk a little bit about our team. I don't know what to shot the face. That's what I just, my, just like the slam shots. That's my dad. Have you ever been shot in the face? Yes, man. I'm so worried. Did you look at all that? No, no, I'm so afraid of my face and she can't really. You're just, trench my whole fucking head. Life is pain. Life is dedication. Life is pressure. Life is p2a. 1a. This is the X-Men Tony Freeman. You're watching our X-Men. She's going to show us a program. She's got a DVD called Fortra, Kill a Workout Killer Roy Guysom. This is available at FortraDvD. It's full of facts. It's full of facts. It's full of facts. It's actually a very good fat burning 30 minute workout. Straight pencil muscle. I do see. Does it tickle a little bit? It's actually a good thing. I'm looking at some of these pictures here and I see girls making out what he chose. Is this part of the whole video? Well, we have Fortra. We've got frequent orgasms. We're very good for weight loss overall health. It's just really workout. I think it's all sex-related. That's the one I'm talking about. That was the main motivation behind anyone getting a shape. What do you believe that? What do you prefer? What's your favorite video? I can't ask a question. I want to see something interesting. I want to know what's in all her experience. What was the favorite stuff you like to do? Well, to be honest, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You kind of worked it all out already. Yes. One out of time? What's the most outrageous thing you ever did? I think we could a lot of judgment. This judgment was freesome. Chris has definitely done worse than you have. You could possibly say it was a trust me. I had sex with a horse. Oh, no. It's not made. No, no. No, no. I've told you that the crazy thing you did. The thing you liked. Oh, my god. I can't believe I did that. I told you about my first sex party experience. I usually see my own party. There's just an equal guy, a real ratio. But in this party, there were more guys. That night, I came into the scene. The lifestyle of saying I had a sentence. 10 guys at one time. I had to say 10 guys at one after the other. And then I did the same thing in one later. Real. I was saying the life you liked it. You liked it now. Yes. But then I got to go. Do you notice that these swing parties at the girls tend to be ugly? I mean, you probably are like a big thing. It's kind of ugly. Oh, the guy is so ugly. No, it's really hit or miss. It's really a risk. You know, because the entrefee is like. I'm going to get a ton of showers. Right. Right. Right. What if you swallow that like mean to swing club? Would you be like, Jimmy, if you don't turn that fucking phone off, you're out of here too. I'm sorry. What are they going to do? I don't even know how to laugh. I'm here. Put it on my best thing. So let me get back to that question. You've got to shut it off now. You're going to face so good to the lady over here. No. What are you hiding down here? Let's get it. Let's get it. What are you looking at? Jimmy breaks about his decision. I've told you that. We try to have them mold it with one of these molding kits called corner willy. He never brought it in. So I'm assuming that he probably does not trust him. He might just had a killer fuck a moment. This guy. That's the girl. I really good question. Probably people want to hear. What if he would start with a fucking willy? I mean, you're fucking. You're fucking. You're not. Fuck willy. You're willy. Can I ask you a question about this? I'm sorry. I didn't make a. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. Because you didn't bring the clean corner willy. Of course I was asking the lady. I was going to get a thing. You're not going to see what I. And you're stuck on my willy. I bet I might. I might. I might. Fuck the shit. I bet. I might get close willy. If I gave Chris the corner willy, can't he would have clothed it? No, I wouldn't did it. Yes, he would have. No. If you don't want to stick. What is he saying? So I'm going to give you the kid. Jeremy would have given you the kid. Chris. You got a sticky thing in it. And you got a mold. Chris would have done. Tom Springs. He would have sold it. He would have done it. I asked the question. I. He did. I know you do it. I would know you would do it. There's a little. She could flop them in the bathroom. What? My video has a finished angle. Just for entertainment purposes. I could. I saw a diamond. I wish I knew you were here. Jeremy would fucking call me because I could have coordinated my body with how we. We could still do. I just thought we were going to do. Guys, here we go. We're going to go to a quick commercial break. When we come back, we're going to have cat demonstrate some of what she does on maybe on you, Jimmy. You can do like the fetish stuff. Chris, maybe. I think I'm sure could time me. Chris, you know, get whatever you like. We can generally. Zach and each Ellie means off for stomach or something like that. We're laughing too much. Thanks for watching. The heavy muscle show. Or more. Rags muscle. Zach. Zach.
