我不ốt回合三亿延國gie轉摺越來越多連我要分享爆彎的瀑樣如果我認為你是不是只有拍功耳的如果你將十一浧幸福變成 seeing 他最燈心的那我們是成像我們錄影機的球istic因為現在加入境外的這樣的體能S-Stay Better Known, as hashtagS-Stay, your 30-minute question there and answer show with Dave Klumbo all your questions, diet, training, supplementation, I-A-B-B-PRO's news whatever was on your mind, it is all on the tables, you know, I'll bring it Dave Klumbo Dave obviously it's been about three, four days now the bodybuilding world still very much in shock to the news that we received Sunday throughout the course of the day there were seemingly unverified reports but then at a certain point we were late in the afternoon we all pretty much had a universal agreement that the news is true and that John Meadows had in fact left us a big loss for the bodybuilding world and you know, you read the tributes obviously you posted a very heartfelt tribute that night he was someone that no one has a negative word to say about you know, universally acclaimed as a bodybuilding trainer coach personality but you know, the way that we penned it and the way that I- me personally that I will, I guess always remember he said he was everyone's number one fan he seemed to be happiest for everyone regardless of whatever realm of the bodybuilding world they were in due it was just so happy to be around everyone you know, we used to see him at the shows and you remember how happy he was to just talk about anything so some of the certainly he's going to be very much missed by bodybuilding fans and everyone like you know, I think he was well liked also because he wasn't one of these guys who went around saying you see my guy he won or my girl she won, you know, he didn't really make himself he didn't try to put himself out they're like he was the guy who won he was just the guy who was helping out and doing what he liked to do, you know and I think that comes off as being very humble because a lot of people want to take, you know, get all the credit for their athletes when he after all the athletes that do in the work were just, you know, as coaches myself included, you know, were just the guys who were women who were providing information and motivating our clients and yeah, that's important but after all, when someone wins the Olympia it's not about the coaches about the guy who won and I think the job was all about that he was all about promoting the athletes that he worked with not about trying to get himself in there and get more people out of it and that's because he just liked what he did and when you like what you do, it comes off as sincere and it comes off as like you're having a good time, you know, it's not stressful, it's not a lot of work and people always ask me the same question I can only relate it to myself where people say they've always worked and you ever sleep, I say, well, I am working but I kind of like what I'm doing so it's not really, it's not like I really feel like I'm overwhelmed with work and I think that's the way he was he wanted to work in what he liked doing and it came off as so sincere and genuine that people are attracted to that they want to be around someone who loves the same things that they love and that's why he had such a following and that's why I think people saw upset when he passed because people just even if they didn't really work with him they liked his energy that he projected about the industry because it wasn't like this negative, you know, the people out there who were very negative about everything it wasn't this negative projection it was this positive like, hey, everyone can build muscle, here's, you know, advice on how to do it and have a good time doing it because that's what it's all about and so he's missed of course because of that because we want to be around people I enjoyed interviewing, when I interviewed him I always, when the interview was over, I was in a good mood I felt like we had a lot in common and that, you know, I could sense his genuine he had this child-like gettingness about working out and quantifying things and figuring out new ways to achieve different results but you know, at the end of the day we never know when our time clock is up and his alarm went off and they took them to a better place at this point and so we have to look at it as not as a sad loss but as, hey, we were lucky to have this guy in our lives for as long as we did and his body of work will never disappear, it's out there still obviously it's a big loss to his family his wife and his kids but and that's something that, you know, there's nothing we can say to make them feel any different time, we'll have to heal that wound but obviously we can support them I think there is a go-fundMe campaign if we find it, we could put that go-fundMe campaign up there so people want to contribute to help put the costs of everything now that he's not here anymore sure his family would be greatly appreciative and once again, I send my love and prayers out to everyone who was touched by John at some point in their life yeah, as for the go-fundMe we did post it on our Instagram about $194,000 yeah, incredible so we will have that link in the article description below so again, we send our warmest warmest wishes someone contributed to 10,000 dollars a couple times there I think too look at the mom and just wow when someone like you when you're that loved and the industry and people are, you know, are that generous, you know, with their money because you've touched them in such a way that's a special person we're just going to show you the kind of man that he was and the kind of love, I'm pouring of love that this industry has given us away so again if you have not already contributed to go-fundMe we're going to put the link below and you'll have every chance to assist John's family during his very very difficult time let's get to the questions of course the first two questions are from the Dave Plumbo experience app Dave after I recently reviewed all your assday videos I found a theory that most of your recommended food supplements such as Mac and the oil Avocado oil or Racketonic acid are basically infant supplementary or additive of baby complimentary foods is this theory that something would be applied to bodybuilders daily basis so then he goes on to say something else so I don't know if you do make sense or that kind of a theory think about what's the population I've been aware of that obviously compliment or that similarity but there's a reason what babies grow their main goal is to sleep and grow and they sleep and grow because of what's going on in their body hormones are being produced which is making their bodies change very rapidly and they are tremendous in our nutrients and that's why they have protein drinks people think that breast milk is low in protein but it's really not when you think about it if you get a gram or two of protein at every dose throughout the day and the baby only weighs 7 pounds the baby is drinking 8 or 9 times a day so that's a gram per pound that it weighs so that's perfect so babies need high protein good essential fatty acids for brain development and muscle development and they need calcium for bone strengthening so it's basically a little baby is like a little microcosm of the bodybuilding world and so if you want to be a great bodybuilder you need to consume a lot of protein at least a gram per pound that you weigh you need to consume a lot of essential fatty acids because we know they're not only an integral for nerve development but also all the muscle cell membranes and they've been made to these whole the hormones and prostate glands and they're produced from these so you need your fish oils or your DHA is what they supplement the babies with which is one of the intermediate found in fish oil a rack and anonic acid which is in the central omega 6 fatty acid like you said the monomusaturated fats they're all in there because those are what the body needs and then what do the babies do all day? they sleep all day so the more you sleep as a bodybuilder that's when your body is growing and recovering when you're workout so it does it babies mimic the adult situation so greatly that it's no coincidence and once again what's the best way to grow? Eat small meals throughout the day just like babies do and so I think that it's not a coincidence and what I do recommend is ironic but it's at the same time very consistent with what you would think a lot of people don't even know the essential fats and explain that over and over again that you need these things to maximize your body's ability to build and repair muscle think about it you can eat half as much protein as you do and you'll still grow but you won't grow as much same thing with fats you can leave that all the fats in your diet there's indirect sources of fat within the protein sources you eat like chicken and meat something that's in fish but it's not a lot so you'll still grow but you might be limiting your body's ability to put on maximum size and recover as quickly as possible because you're not getting enough fat or you're not getting enough protein or you're not getting enough sleep or you're over training your body and that's why some people make very good you know progress in some people make so-so progress I you know pride in myself unack-somizing my body's ability to grow okay by doing every covering every variable possible and during a five or seven year period I put on you know 110 or 120 pounds of muscle not just body weight of muscle so to do that you have to really maximize everything you do and that's why I sit here and I week after week after week I instruct people on what to do you don't have to listen to me you can get mediocre results if you want but I'm telling you if you follow the the tenets of the science that we're discussing here and of the basic principles of nutrition if you you're going to put on really good amounts of size and your burn fat depending on what your goal is it's pure science and then you have to go out and apply it obviously I can't go to the gym with you and make you bench press and you know put full range of motion and lifting heavy weights assuming you're doing that though you got to do the supplementation and you got to do the food that's part of the whole equation second question again from the day of lungo experience that they've with your rotational diet two days no carbs one day carbs you never go in a ketosis you know it's questionable I mean theoretically to get into ketosis you really need to restrict carbohydrates for three days but some people can go into ketosis eating a little bit of carbs because they're metabolism is so fast they metabolize whatever they're consuming carbohydrates and so a lot of guys will be in ketosis you could tell when you're in ketosis because your brain really feels very clear you feel clear headed and you feel like you have a lot of mental energy that's the best way I can describe it when I do the rotation diet and I get to like two or three days of protein fat and a row and then one day of carbohydrates that's when people tend to be in ketosis and then they'll come out for like one day when they're on the carbs and they go back into ketosis when you're doing more when you're doing like when I have people doing like three carb days and a row and only one protein in fat day that's very low in carbs a lot more than likely you're not in ketosis on those days but I felt it with my body I've probably probably had 80 or 90 grams of carbs per day and I'm talking carbs from like a little bit of rice or a little bit of potato and I'd still be in ketosis I knew it, I could feel it and as soon as I would go over the edge like over 90 I could tell now my brain was looking for glucose and I was always hungry and I was getting those cravings and low blood sugars so you gotta figure out what works for your body but I had a very fast metabolism so for people with slow metabolism you can't give them any stargia carbs they just will not stay in ketosis but once you have to be in ketosis to lose weight you can be on a low carb diet and lose weight too as long as you're getting your essential fats in that your body requires you don't necessarily have to be in ketosis it's just more comfortable to be in ketosis because your brain has an unlimited fuel source and the source in the way of fats let's go to our Instagram questions again if you're not already following this or hand those official underscore or ex muscle if you're watching us for the first time on YouTube hit the subscribe button below hit the notification bell you're not going to miss any of our shows, segments or updates if you like what you're watching hit the like button comment below that helps and as always we thank you for all your support let's go to diesel D23 gear wise what would you say someone is running in classic firsts open? so I guess if you want to alter that to how much? you know I hate to say this because it's not really a big great data set that I have here but I really I've seen you know I work with people and I see what somebody's got a lot of these cycles are exactly the same for the class skin the open guys let's face the classic guys are just smaller guys than the open guys there are some classic guys they can get bigger and do keep themselves smaller and they may take a little bit less gear because they already got all the muscle they need but for most of the classic guys that are still trying to add muscle and improve the way they're physical they're using cycles that are very comparable to the open guys maybe not the extreme open guys that are doing ridiculous amounts but I'm talking for a guy who's in the open glass who doesn't overdo his gear I think the classic in the open cycle the amounts are about the same I would say now having said that there's always the one person that doesn't fit that mold and I'm sure there's guys in men's physique they probably use more than some of the open guys do but that's just you know that's that's life some people are just extremists but I don't think the cycles of that much different I got newsfeed I see bikini girls that are using more gear than the women's body those are using I don't know why but they do it it happens all the time so you gotta find out what works for you and don't worry about what anyone else is doing it's good to action figure 86 if you eat too much carbs you spill over and it gets stored as body fat too much protein gets converted into glucose what happens when you eat too much fat well I mean I guess you get simplistically sippedyking if you eat too much protein a lot of it believe it in a lot of it gets metabolized directly as fuel rather than getting converted right to carbs some of it is converted to carbs but a small amount of it gets converted to carbs that's why it's hard to get fat from eating too much protein you could stall your diet and not lose any more weight because now your body is using the protein for fuel but very it's very you have to eat a lot of extra protein to actually store that stuff it's fat obviously the extra carbs it's easy to get fat and as far as some fat's go that's going to get stored directly as fat they don't require insulin so if you overeat fat you will store the extra as fat I mean it's just that is not something people eat as so much because it makes you nauseous and you need too much of it so you don't really see people eating a whole stick of butter it's just not something you do so more than likely you're not getting fat from overeating fat now I know girls and probably if you guys have the hooky who can eat a whole jar of peanut butter the problem with peanut butter is that it's not all fat it's got a lot of carbs and protein in it so it's the carb component that you're getting fat from really not the fat component I mean when was the last time you saw someone take a bottle of my macadamia and it'll just start chugging it down while they're watching TV you don't do that you'll be sick to get stomach so I don't really see the overeat consumption of fats as much as I do foods that have fats in them like I said people will over consume nuts or peanut butter very rarely have I seen anyone sitting at eat five of the macados because it's just you can't know how to see what's in doing so like I said but if you do eat extra fat it can be stored in fat I'll tell you where people make a mistake with fat a lot of times when they're cooking their foods they're pouring and doing that pan spray they're putting oil in the bottom of the pan and then the food that they're eating is absorbing that oil and then they're so they're over consuming fat and that a lot of times sabotage their diet so if you fit in that category or I recommend that you you poach your foods or you grill them so you don't have to put all that extra oil in the pan because the food does absorb it it's going to cost the meat do you ever do many cuts when bulking for better insulin sensitivity how many cake house should you reduce for how long et cetera I don't think they could have thrown an extra initial into that whole thing again you got to repeat it again between sling and cake house of a big deal what was the question? the first part of the question is did you ever do many cuts while bulking for better insulin sensitivity? I didn't do that, I'll tell you why because I really never got fat in the overseas but I do work with people that were bulking them up and they get to a point and I think they get a little too sloppy and I'll throw some cardio in there I'll cut their carbs back in a little bit and put them on a diet per se but I'll change things around to lean them out a little bit and then I'll start going again forward so yeah that is nothing wrong with doing that I think that's if the person tends to get fat rather than turn to have fat hanging off their waist it's a good time, it's a good time it's a good thing to do is to bring them back a little bit I wouldn't put them on climb uteroll or fapper is there I would just cut back their food a little bit so yesterday we had a carrot body on the show of course two-troll winner at the time Pro Nico Cantomira wants to know when you prepped him Did you apply your keto diet, your rotational diet if you want to maybe give us a glimpse as far as how you went into for carrot carrot has a very fast metabolism so most of the diet he was eating I was doing a rotation type he was eating a lot of days of carbs and then some days of protein in fat just like shock his body every third day or so or every fourth day or so and then when we got closer I kept kind of the same format but I cut back the carb amounts in the carb days because he does have a very fast metabolism so as long as his weight was coming down which was doing consistently and very easily his weight he loses weight at a good pace once I died of there was no really reason to really turn the screw down between Chicago and Tampa I felt that we had to bring a better look to the stage I knew it was going to be competitive it was going to be a lot of same guys I knew that it was going to be determined on who was the leanest guy on stage so I did torture him for those 10 days or so and we went protein in vegetables we went no carbs and very little fat for three or four days in a row and that's three or four days he lost five or six pounds I'm sure some of them were water but he really leaned out a lot and brought his glutes and hamstrings way better than they were for Chicago and I really believed that's what pushed him over the edge but once again you talk about a guy who is a really, really genetically gifted guy and the metabolism category I'd never seen the guy fat he was telling us in the interview that he was drinking he was really depressed he wasn't working out because the gym was close he was drinking beers and when he came back and said I'm ready to start again he didn't even look bad he might have lost a little bit of muscle just because he wasn't lifting weights but he really his body fat was not high it was higher than it was for the show but it was not high so that just tells me the guy has got a gift in the metabolism so he's not a good guy to kind of emulate unless your metabolism is similar to his Relentless Lucas he wants to know as far as is it good to take a pump product before stepping on stage I guess well generally be your advice as far as timing mechanism for using a pump product you know a lot of people have asked me this question I know some people that actually do it not a lot of people I think it's risky I'll tell you why because if you look great backstage you're not being judged on veins because if there was a context on who has the best veins on stage I would be Mr. Olympian no one had better veins than I did okay crazy court like veins they don't care about that they can't with the judges care about his muscle separation how the muscles look how this stretching the skin which is fullness how they separate meaning the grooves that they create so when you see looking on stage and people flex their muscles you see lines that's what the judges are looking for they don't care if you're pumped out of your mind matter of fact having a lot of veins sometimes is a little distracting you know on a physique and if you blow those veins out too much a lot of times they can bring water to the surface a little bit and so I think the pump products are dangerous because they do dilate the veins but they're not and they do bring a little bit more muscle but they're really not improving separation and then in essence if you ever did a crazy set of squats in the gym and your legs look enormous and they're all veney they don't have a lot of separation because there's a lot of fluid in there from all that pump aspect that's going on all that blood going in there because the blood can leave the vessels and go under the skin a little bit so I would say do not take a pump product prior to getting on stage I think it's risky and like I said if you're in shape don't play these cookie games the last minute because you know what all you can do is screw yourself up interesting one here from a cheap Monday and the reason that I bring this up you do have a lot of bodybuilders now who I know I got to specifically you have the conversation with Hunter's brother regarding his prep and his take on vegetables you have a lot of bodybuilders who try to get their nutrients in other ways other than having vegetables the question is is it really important that vegetables make me float is a possible to take fiber and micro nutrients from supplements and completely avoid vegetables it's a good question and I have a really good answer for that I never give my clients vegetables I never ate vegetables for the reason of getting nutrients because most vegetables and devoid of nutrients and for most of the vegetables that we eat is bodybuilders pre-contest it's like green beans and asparagus and lettuce since this really not a lot of nutrients in that we're doing it to keep our stomachs full basically we're trying to bulk up our diet a little bit so that we're not starving to death and giving our body a little bit energy to use that's really what it's being used for most of the micro nutrients that you need vitamins, minerals, trace metals that's how to come from supplementation is not a lot in foods anymore it's very hard to get enough and figure out how many to get this many milligrams this many microbes of that it's not even worth it just take a supplementation like the mineralized it's not only vitamins and minerals covered you're taking essential fatty acids supplement like omega-lytes and then you don't have to worry about the micro nutrients and all the essentials you've got them in there right the food the macronutrients that's the food protein fat carbs that's going to help build repair muscle provide a fuel source that's what you need that for that's the most important thing so when we're eating, especially pre-contest we're really focused on getting enough protein, fat, and carbs and depending each person has a different required amount that they need that's the most important thing if you try to do everything and get everything into your diet, you accomplish nothing trust me can you skip vegetables altogether? absolutely, it probably doesn't even matter I think a lot there was a lot of diets that I ate off season where I never even ate a single vegetable I happened to like the taste of vegetables but if I felt that it was inhibiting my ability to get enough of the good stuff and it was going to help me build and repair muscle I just skipped it in other words, if I'm going to sit in an eat-a-meal and if I have a salad with this meal I'm not going to be able to eat as much protein as I need to eat because I need to eat 10 ounces at a meal on the salad, the salad that's not helping me is not doing anything just because it's green doesn't mean it's doing anything that's foolish thinking but if I know that I need so many milligrams of vitamin C and vitamin E and B vitamins to metabolize carbohydrates help me with those reactions I'm going to make sure I take a damn good multi-videy and multi-mineral to get enough calcium and magnesium I dying, you know, chromium, all those things because I know that those micro nutrients assist all the chemical reactions in the body so don't worry about getting micro nutrients from foods, get it from supplements take your fiber supplement, like fiber-lies to make sure you got enough fiber in your diet so you don't have to bulk up your meals with the ton of vegetables and carbohydrate-laden foods like, you know, old-brand and then just worry about eating your meals to get your protein fat in carbs Tom, for a couple more questions, let's go to Big Daddy Jank's, are there any areas of dying training where you would say the, quote, meat-headed body-building community is ahead of the science and accepted research I think the body-building world is ahead forever and it's always considered to be ahead because you know what, there's always going to be these scientists that will do these isolated experiments showing that, oh, if you do the movement like this with this angle, you're actually activating more muscle fibers but, you know, guess what? You know, we've already had 300 pound body-balls on stage in shape. It's got big for a reason because they lifted heavy ass weights, okay, with full range motion, okay, using, you know, good-mind muscle connection. There's nothing that's going to replace those exercises just like there's no one's going to come up with a steroid cycle, okay, after they've been out for 67 years now that we didn't think about already back in the day. All of it, there might be new drugs that hit the market, okay, at some time in the future that build muscle that we haven't even conceptualized yet, but other stuff that's out there, no one's coming up with a better scheme than what's already out there. Sorry, they've been around too long, we know what works, everyone's trying every combination, we know what works, okay? Same thing with exercises. You want to get big legs, you squat weight, you squat heavy weight with full range of motion, okay, and you build big legs. If you can't squat, you have an injury, you have to use leg press or smith machine, that's fine too, but nothing's replacing the squat, okay, none of these exercises. So the bodybuilders know what works to build muscle. Now, if you're a bodybuilder and you're trying to get big legs, that doesn't mean that that's the right exercise to use, okay, if you want to be a sprinter and have great explosive movement, it might be something you incorporate, but there might be new ones on the squat and on the leg press that are going to help you with explosive type movements on stage. I mean, in your event. So the bodybuilders know what works for the bodybuilders in the gym, drug wise, given what drugs are out there right now, and we kind of have the food thing that they could figure out pretty well too. Up until recently, they were teaching in school the food pyramid. Now they're at least modifying that a little bit to include some more open type of ideas about insulin management and stuff like that. But at the end of the day, bodybuilders are still, I think, light years ahead of everyone else when it comes to diet. I talked to people, I do consultations with regular people all the time. They know nothing about diet. They do not teach you this stuff in school. I have no idea why not. It makes perfect sense to actually have a course on how to eat. I wish they would teach kids how to eat. I wish they would have a realistic, hey guys, this is what this is protein, this is fat, this is carbohydrates. This is what these things do. If you want to achieve this, you eat this and you want to achieve that, you eat that. If you want to be healthy and keep your cholesterol low, you have to eat lower, carbohydrate and sugar and foods. If you want to lose body fat, you have to keep your carbohydrates lower to keep insulin levels lower. If you want to have, what do you want to put extra muscle on, you need extra protein in your diet, because that's what builds both. They don't teach you that in school. I don't know why, maybe one day they will. I'll take one more and you have leek, pre-scoming up in just a matter of minutes. Interesting one here is from Chester Brown. So he goes, as men's physique competitors, wear board shorts to hide the parts that are not being judged. And then I guess he facetiously has, how long do you think it'll be until the open men's are wearing football socks up to their knees? So if you want to clarify as far as calves and he bearing on judging, and I know he's kind of joking, but does he have a point? You know, the problem is that you don't really see the, you know, people don't look down that low to see calves. I mean, back in Arnold's day, I think guys legs worn his big, so calves really stuck out a lot more as being a really important body part. But if you have a guy like Randy with enormous, enormous quads, I mean, you're almost don't even look past those quads. They're so great. I'm not saying it's a body part that should be neglected, but I think it's less important, just like, how many people lost a show because they had great arms that they didn't have good forearms. You know, you see them, but everyone's looking at the arm up in the air. If you got a big bicep and tricep, it's very impressive looking. So I'm more upset about the fact that they don't judge men's physique legs than they, than they don't really pay attention to the calves of open bodybuilders. Because I mean, after all, I mean, why not judge men's physique's legs? Why not judge the whole body? I mean, what is men's physique? It's really, it's a, it's a, it's a physique contest without posing essentially. So why not show the whole physique? I can definitely see over the course of the next, you know, five, ten years, made to the board shorts getting shorter, made to them changing that up a little bit. Because I think a lot of those guys in men's physique actually do have good legs. And some of them don't want to pose on stage. They don't want to go to classic physique. Now I understand that if you want to show your legs and you have, you can go to classic. But a lot of these men's physique guys don't want to get as big as these guys in classic. And they want to stay in men's physique. So you never know. I think we have a, a much better chance of seeing the board shorts get smaller than than than than not judging than then covering up people's calves with the big socks. I don't know what's going to happen. That's going to do for this episode of As Dave or Mindar right now in the article description below. We have to link to the GoFundMe set up for John Meadows family. So again, whenever we've had its situations where bodybuilder or bodybuilder's family than their need, this community is always stepped up. And we expect that you will do the same for John Meadows family. For anybody this in the Columbus Ohio area, we posted on our Instagram the information for John Meadows service. We're going to take place later this week. I believe Friday. So again, we pass along our warmest wishes to John Meadows family to his legions of followers. And do what you can to keep his memory alive. We know that he loved this sport and he loved everyone in his community. For Tyler Short and Dave, along both, I'm Siddhi Furuki. We'll see you next time.
