I don't know, it's a good question. You know, off season I try to keep the dosages to two compounds, you know, like two and a bottle, like a testosterone and an anabolic and then maybe some growth hormone. I don't ever use like three compounds very rarely. Maybe just in the beginning, some of them might throw a few deep wall tabs in or something like that. But I try to keep it to two compounds because I find that your body can eat better. Because the limiting factor off season, a lot of times, not the drugs, it's the ability to get that food down. If you're taking toxic compounds at the world or short acting, you know, injectables a lot of times they kill your appetite and if you can't eat, you can't grow. So now pre-contest appetite is never a problem, right? Because you're starving all the time. So I don't mind using three compounds or four compounds pre-contest because I'm not worried about the appetite being destroyed and I'm not worried about receptor overload because at this point we're not growing. We're just trying to maintain muscle, give the body a hard look. And I think that's the difference, at least in my mind, of why people use more drugs pre-contest versus off season. At least that's my rationale. I don't know if other people have, I think some people in their mind think that they can actually grow muscle while they're getting ready for a trophy, take more drugs. Of course that's not the case because you're on a limited amount of resources because you're trying to deprive your body of what it needs a little bit, right? So you lose body fat every week. In doing so, your body's first priority is not going to build muscle. It's just trying to survive, so to speak. You're trying to maintain muscle while burning body fat. So don't confuse the two processes or you're going to accomplish nothing, essentially.
