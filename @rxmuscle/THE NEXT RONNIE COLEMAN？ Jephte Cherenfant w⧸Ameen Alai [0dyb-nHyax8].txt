some pictures and askand you ask my opinionif you don't track as what does he look likeand thenand then I started to find out about how strong this this man wasand I blew my mind with when I saw this Instagram handle by the way he goes by呃 no breaks big bad bonding啊哈哈哈哈 right triple b his guy and he's a threat and I'm telling you I we haven't seen well and I really hope this goes viral for Jeff because we haven't seen this kind of training since Ron he's plotting eight plates asked to the calves for reps six weeks before the show you got you got that on the Instagram see if you can pull that up Tyler pull it up right now you're going to see in saying stuff he's he dead with the nine plates on each side why why didn't really that oh my god five plates on each side for reps like it was candy oh so that's why you and ride have this kinship in the gym on because they're the same they we all pack man who are what's that I said they're about you know we're not they're not everybody we're playing the disco 1990s 1980 style heavy and high what's big bad bonding me where did you get that name from so bungee is basically from my Haitian heritage so bungee is probably like literally translate like the tough guy the big guy like he got that he's he is basically like kinku bad in the mario that's guy you have to think when he went he know one of the hardest from my current and in big bad bungee is just if you would have told me I mean if he would have told me that he's brothers with a key a key Williams I would swear the two of them look exactly the same and they they basically both just to strong as each other hey you know I think a key is uh is he Haitian also I know I think he's Jamaican maybe he's Jamaican I think Max Should is Max Should is Max Should is a man but a key man him looks him they look like they could be brothers they have they even look alike like a little bit I think if you if you had if you had no hair you know like he does you look like let's let's talk about his hair smile just a grownage hair for 13 years it goes down he's he's about five a hundred and a half is that right five a lot of six foot six foot into him he goes down to his body building you want to round down Jeff and and and and another sports you round up yeah yeah but but it goes down it as as tall as he is it goes all the way down to to the top of his rear to the very low part of his back we haven't seen hair like that since Ty Green and his is much more impressive while his Ty Green is not real you know Ty Green is fake yeah so Jeff he got real hat that's the real deal this guy's the real deal the way he lifts a real it's impressive and I'd be I mean the honest with you because I mean I lost him and that that was really hard for me but I mean he just lost his brother and and when it got down to crunch time down to do the key he was in my any three weeks before the show bearing his brother and then he falls he finds right back to go zero cards hundred reps the whole my whole hell week that that's been coined hell week he went through the whole thing under rods supervision the two of us work together rod and I worked together and you know rod is brutal in the gym there's no trainer no trainer that's going to push you like rod because when rod says two more you're going to do it just because his voice is so deep you don't do those two reps he might punch you or something that's even worse Jeff earlier for odd helping right Jeff how much muscle did what did you gain from what do you weigh at 2018 or the Americans 2018 well 66 to 66 that all right on wings but you really I'm sure you weren't this lean no no see that was the difference so it's it's a different kind of weight yeah put it that way okay I mean how big things can this guy get I mean he's got a huge frame what do you think would be the ideal way for this guy to really be as a dominant pro at competitive weight yeah I think he could compete easily in the two 80s I agree yeah easily and right now you're two ninety what Jeff about two magnifog the kind of five right now we just competed he was 271.8 at the way ends you know 263 on stage that's that's the magic that happens the last few weeks when I suck them in and pull the wall you want to see him to 80 on stage just suck dry right right eventually that's coming right this rebound in itself and the fact that Rod's really targeting his back and Rod does exactly what to do is I mean he's a he's a fact animal he has exactly what to do to bring up Jeff's back they're trying to we got special workouts we're going to be posing three times a week he's going to be doing the stairs three times a week as up now so you're going to see shredded glutes like like pro calibre shredded glutes I have enough time Rod has enough time Jeff is motivated it couldn't be better and we're going to I mean literally posing every every day but on really posing sessions three times a week and we're ten weeks out now yeah and we sell now well the good thing is that you know with the work ethic like that and and when you lift and that Rod you could test this I can I could talk directly just Roddy Coleman is a perfect example when you lift heavy weights and you got great genetics and you eat right you got the right people advising you you grow and you grow dense big round muscle that's what you do and you can't help but grow I mean look at the guys who lift the heaviest you know the a king Williams and the Ronnie Coleman's and the Dorian Yates they got muscle to show because of it there's not many people that is lifting the weights that you are lifting Jeff and the gym I mean is that are you a naturally strong guy or do you notice that as you've gotten bigger you're you're weight you're just your strength is increased exponentially I think it's a combination of two but you know training with Rod ever since I got with Rod like my my strength games have jumped exponentially like because he's a big performance of training training hard and heavy right so well I got with the 10 reps with a moderate rate and we're I push as you put heavy weight on that for 10 to 50 when we're running that big without ride pushing you into that uncomfortable zone and that's important but you think about it Dave you have to be if you're trying to bring about any type of change and a physique there's other ways you can do it but those people don't last long do that now so what we're saying is so I think it comes down to a skin constantly pushing that ramp a little bit now granted you can't go hard every day in a day out you have to cycle and go back a couple of weeks let's go back in you know it's something that you have to be looking at in the videos okay fine we we're pushing now you're about to lose a little racket right now but that's the good thing about a train like we we train we train with a group of guys and like when he came back from Florida when his situation what it was what do we do do we wrap on the wrong give a coup by our moment and say hey bro you got to show you know like that what's the guy see he friends they're sorry yeah you'll say yeah you know that I bought but you know it I was about it because a pack mentality one's up and next we'll shoot them down let's keep it going pushing I'm a huge proponent that you got to find someone who's strong in the new and then it's going to push you out of your comfort zone otherwise you're going to stay in that zone and you're not going to make improvements I had a group of guys that I worked out with when I was coming up too that was strong in the me and maybe they didn't have better physics than me at some point but they were stronger in the me and they maybe do stuff that I didn't want to do because who the hell wants to get under you know a squat ball with 700 pounds it's a I'll do six plates for for for six reps no no you're going to get on the 700 you're going to do for two reps why don't really want to get on to there and you know what that forces new growth in your body that's that's what you got to do all this time we have a situation where a guy says maybe okay coaches that's a place on the squat right I know that I'm going to put my point is is it how do you know yeah a time is right you got spotter you got the right training yeah let's go to the go right you're next thing you already do it they look at you like oh my god I did right that's my job I'm a thing for you now yeah but you you become a do let me think for it it's very important I always say that you got to have a good even if you don't have a group of guys you got to have a good training partner who's willing to push you and be there to be able to spot you because yeah I've I've gotten on the bars where I really didn't trust the spotter too much because I was in a foreign gym and I just didn't go as heavy as I wanted to because I was afraid I was going to get crushed with the weight and then would be knowing that it pulled off me so it's great that he's got you and all the other guys there on a regular basis pushing him you know yeah that's the great part because I remember the group that we train with there's a guy who benches more than me there's a guy who does leg curls my hand then we have a group of ladies who go at it really hard so even when I need some inspiration right I have to look over and see the group of ladies working hard and I'm ready to go it doesn't take much to motivate me but I could always find it but David will be the situation like man which will train the girls of the oh yeah you know you don't spare feelings and it's going to try to be ladies baby because we do want something different over here right you have a choice Jeff who's your if you look into bodybuilding world now what what physics do you like like what like what guys do you admire and say that's that's a guy who want to look like or that or even maybe in the history of bodybuilding what's your word of where your favorite body will just coming up well if we will say right now yeah I'm a big proponent like I love shink and round this so I would like I would say Sean Rodin but my favorite bodybuilder of all time right that's what you like to do okay I feel like his body proportions and his muscle belt is I think he just had a beautiful physique right you know Ronnie was amazing he had the wild fact you could never go on without mentioning him but flex will it was always my favorite bodybuilder now if you had a compare your physique to someone like who like who are you trying to emulate when you watch videos like who do you try to imitate and steal stuff from and incorporate it here with you who would you say you think your body looks like the most oh I don't know post the public say that I take I take parks from everyone that I see like even the way that I pose when I do my last but I I learn that from watching Brandy Kirby right all people like you know he's a newer guy you know grand scheme of things and you know my side chest I've just taken things from everyone that I see so I wouldn't just narrow it down to one person right I don't think my my physique is dissimilar to anyone type of person so guys I'm just trying to make the what I have work for me the best that I can right right well I wanted to you know thank you for coming on Rod thanks for joining us to me thank you Jim over there good luck with the and you're doing some great work out there in in Colorado with the I've again treatments I appreciate all you guys coming on the show all the time and good luck at the nationals because you know what it's a crazy year but sometimes crazy years result in in great results so I you've had a lot of hardships you've overcome I like your your never quit mentality and I think in the end of the day you're going to come out on top so good luck to you they're good to be shake that's what is Instagram and the description so people could see it's basically they saw it we we had it up here we would put flash in pictures and Instagram stuff I'll show you guys if you want to check him out go go hit a go like his page and if you want to also contact the mean what's the best way I mean the room in a line dot com there you go you got a whole website like I guess dedicated to helping people who have substance abuse problems so check it out no that's that's my personal website they have real real reset so I yeah that's the shirt that the gym's got on there the rest of the gym's got on that's the eye-begining that's what we're doing it's not just drug addiction is depression people get off any depressants it's the second one is gambling addiction that's another one too so yeah I don't have a side of a game here gambling addiction that's what I want to know like a logical yeah it's all psychological recessive research you have no longer had the compulsion that you usually have it it gets rid of compulsion this is the fault it's two people that want that are in that have an addiction pornography yeah it's a little bit craving to one of the compulsions one of locks for anography great great I know a couple guys I'm gonna send over to you you really love what he had it you know what I mean so people who are ready for it like I don't know if Tony huge is ready for it hey he needs a reset he probably would do it just for the experience right he tells me he wants to do it and we're planning on flying to Thailand whenever or maybe he doesn't want to do it maybe that maybe he doesn't want you to reset them then he might have been bored but his life has been reset him I'm wondering the same thing it's like you always said what's this guy's life it's really interesting so we'll see what happens whether it's going to change him in a good way or in a bad way or in a good in bad way all right well guys that's going to be it for today I'm day polo with the for I mean a lie Jim Tamagini big ride and of course Jeff Charan font we'll see you next time
