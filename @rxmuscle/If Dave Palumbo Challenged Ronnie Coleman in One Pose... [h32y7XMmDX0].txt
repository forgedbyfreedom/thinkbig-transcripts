Saitrice. Gustavo Badell showed that right off the bat and that was Ronnie's worst pose. That was Gustavo's best pose. I don't think it was my best pose but it was a good pose but I wouldn't want to go against Ronnie in any pose. That's how good Ronnie was but yeah that was Ronnie's worst pose everyone knew it you know. The funny thing was another really bad pose for Ronnie was the front last spread and it wasn't because it was a bad pose because he had a huge lathe and huge lights. He just didn't had to hit the pose. He hit it like a most musco like he was like flexing into it but his side tries to I don't know why he had problems and I think he just Ronnie wasn't the greatest poseer and I don't know if it had anything to do with the fact that he was so big or the fact that maybe he just you know he just didn't have the mind muscle connection because I'm sure he practiced because Ronnie was a consummate professional. He just wasn't that good at hitting the mandatory. I think it's hard to tell someone who's an eight-time Mr. Olympia you don't know how to hit the mandatory poses. I don't think anyone ever really worked with him to the degree that of deconstructing what he was doing and then building him up again because I think I think a lot of his poses could have been better but he was pretty but he knew at it what the poses he was good at he was so dominant and he didn't even matter you know.
