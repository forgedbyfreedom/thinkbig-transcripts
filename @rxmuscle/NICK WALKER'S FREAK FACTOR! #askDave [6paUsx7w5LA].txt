RXMuscle.comThis is assay of better note As hashtag as day of your 30 minute question and answer show with day plumber all your questions diet training, supplementation Anything in everything going on in and outside of the body building brothers now bringing table on what they've you have recorded I want to say about 8 to 10 hours over the course of the last two days a lot of content obviously earlier today we released the Iron Rage with Lee priest where he I guess responds to his thick accusations from Kenny K.O if you want to give the audience a little primer a little tease as far as what they can expect over the course of the next few days Yeah we got a lot of great stuff you know I got to interview I don't know if a lot of people know who he is Doug Bergnoli who might be one of the most intuitive educated and insightful people in terms of training the guys been competing for 40 years and he he he he he's a he was a regular on rick's corner all the time with with Rick Dreson may rest of this and I got him on here we talked about training functional training how to train properly how to really target muscles how the muscles work I put it this way I enjoy the interview because it was it was that you know enlightening and so I think I know I know all our viewers and fans that they love they want more training stuff they're always telling me this is a great training interview we're going to probably do way more with him in the future too because he's a very knowledgeable guy written a bunch of books also I got an interview that I've been wanting to do for quite a long time I know where Tom Prince texted me and was telling you how much he liked our content on the side who's you know he was checking it out and I said Tom I've been wanting to interview you ironically a man and my wife had just mentioned him the other day and today she said you should get Tom Prince on so it was like it was like the universe telling me here it is so we interviewed Tom and what a great interview was I probably could have talked them for three hours to be honest with you and so I think people are going to really enjoy that and it's a two-part interview I'll have you put them up you know right back to back on each other because it's that good and so that you know and then Lee priests you know is that up so far we have not put that up that is up yeah okay so you guys got to check that one out because obviously Kenny Kayl coldly out for using fake weights Lee basically of course they're fake so check that out Lee's response to Kenny Kayl was very entertaining as well as always let's go to the questions of course the first two questions from the Dave Blumbo experience after first questioning Dave your thoughts on coconut oil for his anti viral offense you know coconut oil in terms of using it in terms of a fat source in your diet is probably you know not that first choice I would pick only because it's really not an essential you don't oil in the sense that if you if I'm going to use fat to my diet I like them to actually have functionality to whether they be anti inflammatory like the Omega 3 fats or have them be you know hard healthy like the the Amano and saturated fats like we have in macadamia that oil coconut oil is kind of an it's an MCT fat it's a fuel source basically but it does have a good you know it does have good immune system enhancing effects according to some of the studies that I've read I know a lot of the back of the Dave HIV patients were using it you know in terms of helping to enhance their immune system and it seemed to work pretty well I use it more as a topical believe it or not it's really good you know for if you have injuries or you know you know you like you know skin abrasions it really I find it has anti scarring properties also in my lower legs for some reason I guess from being like 300 over 300 pounds for many years I had a lot of this coloration there and I rubbed it on there and it works really well if you ever take a bad shot you get a bruise you rub the coconut oil on there and you'll be shocked how quickly it disperses that bruise uh apple cider vinegar will do the same thing yeah I ironically enough so I do like coconut oil but like I said it wouldn't be my first choice in terms of a fatty acid source second question again from the Dave Hと思box experience app would you to lies in the matt not oil or olive oil in place of nut butters possibly speed up my metabolism I'm a big believer that the amount of it's saturated fats do speed metabolic rate to a certain degree now if you start exceeding what your body needs energy-wise per day you can't store some of that obviously so you can't just drink an unlimited amount of mac oil you know if you saw how much mac oil however I put on my food you'd be shocked I don't even measure it I just poured on there because in my metabolism in the fact that I don't really eat a very high carb diet I'm probably you know eating probably under the caloric you know intake that I need for the day sometimes so I can eat a lot of fat and it just it just revs my metabolism but I have that kind of a metabolic rate too I have a very fast metabolism so you've got to judge what your metabolism if you're a girl and you're taking in you know six tablespoons of mac oil per day that's a lot of calories that's a lot of energy that your body does might not need so you've got to judge it based on that and my suggestion is if you don't have a very fast metabolism measure it you know now is mac and demon on a oil better than say a tablespoon of all natural peanut butter my answer to that is it's different okay so I like to vary the fatty-estants sources you know every day I don't like to take in the same type of fat at every single meal so I think it's good to have a tablespoon of almond butter or peanut butter or tablespoon or two of mac and demon out of all some whole eggs you know for the egg yolks and the saturated fats and there is good some wild caught salmon for the omega 3s and there I like to vary my sources of fats and I think that's the key I think it's it's not all or none it's balanced let's go to our Instagram question again if you're not already following us our handle is official underscore our ex muscle and as always if you're watching us on YouTube you're watching us for the first time and you haven't already subscribed hit the subscribe button below hit the notification bell you're not going to miss any of our upcoming shows segments obviously partly but here we are in September usually when we be breaking down what just happened at the Olympia but we are if my math is correct less than 12 weeks away from the Olympia so obviously in about through weeks or so we're going to be getting the ball rolling eventually with the preview segment starting to get interviews for our iron rodent the Olympia series all kinds of segments relating to previewing the Olympian of course our pro shows over the course of the next six weeks as well Chicago pro coming up in a three and a half week so again subscribe below hit the notification bell if you like what you're watching hit the like button comment below obviously that helps us and as always we appreciate you our ex nation couple of pre-contest questions start to saw first from Ivan bodybuilding if somebody is not completely peeled one week out but very lean almost there but not quite yet would you still recommend depletion protocols or would you just keep them doing cardio until the day of the show I would never continue cardio to the day of the show I would I would kill them probably earlier in the week doing a ton of cardio cutting their food back increasing their fat burners if depending what they're taking if they're taking anything those last two days before the competition are sacred in the sense that you need to let the body rest rest reduces inflammation which can cloud the muscle you know clarity and definition rest helps the muscles rebuild themselves okay from being in a broken down state which is going to make them look more separated and rest allows the body to store glycogen and and fill out the muscle see you can't be if you're going into a show and you're still training the day before you break down stuff it's not going to end well now if you if you did that out of shape that you that you feel like you have you need every single day to try to you know get rid of the last bit of fact you probably should be doing the show you know that that's the truth so at some point you have to say to yourself okay i'm a week out am i ready am i'm not going to be ready am i going to make a fool of myself if you're going to make a fool yourself don't do the show if you can squeeze in hey i got i can lose the like three four pounds this last week then do it but you got to give you body that was last two days to kind of rest recuperate and come back and you can pose and stuff like that but you be shocked once you start carving you'll burn a lot of calories those last couple days people think all meeting carbs i'm going to get fat now you're not going to get fat you're going to rev your metabolism for a couple days while you're carving you probably will get leaner okay but the problem is it depends on how much body fat you still have left if it's too much hey you blow it you know you shouldn't you shouldn't have waited for the last minute or either that or you need to be not self enough times to die and then at that point you have to have a you know talk with yourself and a reality check second question from Benny and that's Ivan you talked about the carb consumption leading in the was show he wants to know what if you cutting the protein in half the last week before the show replacing it with carbs i know you don't advise people doing anything crazy or a cookie in your words but just as a test sort of as an experiment he's considering that last couple of weeks heading into a show testing and experimenting or not things that you do to excel from a show testing and experimenting some of you do eight or ten or twelve weeks out from a show so bad idea okay if you've established hey this is how much protein i need to maintain my muscle mass while I'm dieting and you cut your protein down i'm not talking the last for a day or two you're cutting it down two weeks out you probably will lose muscle so i wouldn't say that would be a good idea to do two weeks out especially you've never tried it before it's questions from team band band me it's a very long question i'll try to boil it down a little bit um he talks about in terms of weighing in how i guess procedure lead's done in a room with people in it um any goals want to ask or say how you know people who want to stick around they want to see what somebody looks like or you know have their coach value weight them so i think he's talking about sort of the spectacle of potentially i guess having you know competitors weigh in as sort of how they would do in boxing or mma where it is sort of a public event as a sneak preview as far as what fans could expect anything that's viable in this sport weighing the meal you did it i think at the Olympia one year i believe or maybe even more than one year and then he weighed in those pros you know because if you ask the pros they're weight and they just give you their weight they're going to lie they all lie they all pump up their weight so i think if the press conference would be great to put these guys on a scale hey the fill he from the United States step onto the scale you get to the scale uh two fifty two whatever you know whatever he weighs and i think the fans would love i think i would rather he see that press conference then have these uh they didn't have bobchick or real ask him dumb questions that didn't that no one wants to answer i think that would be more exciting to see hey you know and then this people can get a sneak peek at what these guys look like because they'd have to weigh in there in their opposing trunk so i think would be a great idea to be honest with this specially if if most of us are going to watch the Olympia on on a live stream that would be super exciting it would be like you said like like a boxing match and you know then you could kind of make it and then you can have everyone put their sweats back on and get to get on the stage and if you want to ask them a couple questions like a press conference type of thing you can do that for 15 20 minutes and then i think that would be way more exciting and tolerable than having these guys sit up there you know bunching on their food because they're up there so long they got to eat a meal you know i think 15 20 minutes up there would be better have a couple questions asked to the top guys and uh everyone weighs in so everyone kind of gets there they're their their moment in the in the sun so to speak that's a great idea i think um so this question is about Nick Walker they we posted a picture that he posted uh i want to say late last week uh leap pre-saving common thought do you know which picture i'm talking about yeah okay so specifically it's about his legs it's about veins it's questions from CRG uh he has veins sticking out on his legs especially around his calves and elite priest has opinions on it a lot of people have weighed in first off is that normal second of all i guess in general just to ask a lot of people question what did you think about that picture in the veins specifically he's a freak i mean maybe Tyler can find the picture in his Instagram right it was on i think we put it on our Instagram to write we put it on Instagram press the toilet i uh look at the veins i have in my neck i have those all of my body because i was crazy stride i was crazy vascular you know when i competed i still have the same name i'm just not as big now so the bigger you get and the heavier the weight you lift the more blood supply you need to those muscles so no we're talking about Nick Walker so you know those veins increase in diameter now when i was in high school i had veins all of my arms people always like wow you're a vascular as i got bigger and more muscular those veins got bigger in size so it's normal now sometimes you know when you have huge you know ropey looking veins some of them get dead varicose they're remembering freaks epi used to uh had some weird varicose veins on his on his legs he had to have removed but you know that's genetic you know it depends you know there's nothing wrong with it it the i expect in a big freaky body both to see a lot of big freaky veins you know look at Paul the leg he had crazy we are extremely veins all over his chest but he was huge you know that comes at the territory we pre-season those veins don't look too good well you know lee pre-season the doctor either so let's go to uh Brian leg any tips to pure wider with narrow cleftacles make the biggest cannon mold that's a good reader cannon mold else make the biggest delts you can laryscat used to write articles remember when i used to read the magazine laryscat was the first mr. Olympia and he had narrow cleftacles too but he had huge huge deltoids you know and uh Phil hef is not that wide but he's got huge delts and i i don't i'm not that wide either i had a i had to i had to get like a lot of muscle on my shoulders to really make myself look like i have a taper and so it's an illusion body you know you don't necessarily have to have a huge wide structure but if you have big delts that can compensate obviously you know it's funny people made fun of Jay Cutters' ways for being too wide but his clavicles were so crazy wide that he actually has a really good v-taper he doesn't have a small waste if you put a measurement a taper around it but it didn't matter because structurally he has the right taper you know to to be you know impressive on stage so once again bodybuilding's all in the illusion good question here on glad they asked it um we we've asked the question before Dave about you know if in your day social media was a thing as far as the bodybuilding scene was concerned so it's from long now our youngness such Dave up in prep which way would you have gone in social media was you know prominent during your bodybuilding career would you have a gone the way of say branding car you could recently have been posting a lot more progress pictures and you know like obviously he's an oxygen jams got the magic mirror but yeah again he's giving you a sneak preview or two like Phil who was pretty much made it known that he's going to stay low key off the grid and you know in the attempt to quote shot the world look I I would be the first guy to say that I didn't have the greatest you know structure okay on stage but I was one at the time at least I was probably one of the biggest guys out there and my gift was that I was always leaning if I would have been putting up pictures on like an Instagram account of me training at the gym off season to £315 with veins everywhere and and and strider glutes people would have gone nuts I would I would have had crazy crazy following because people like that that's free piece stuff I you know I looked you know like like a comic book creature with a tank top on and you would think that I was Mr. Olympi with a tank top on because it made me look tapered you know same to Dennis James imagine Dennis James had an Instagram you know when he was competing back in the day I mean he had crazy your freaky gym looking physique too so Jimmy Quinn another guy would have been crazy popular with crazy veins and just huge massive amounts of muscle that's what people like to see on an Instagram that those are the most popular people so I think I would have done really well I would have probably had to have like a training part of that who was filming me because I wouldn't want to be distracted but you know watching you know a £350 squat you know £650 for reps is pretty you know freaking I always wore like you know tank tops in the gym I wasn't one of these guys who covered up all the time I wore tank because I was sweating all the time because I was so hot my metabolism was so fast tank tops and shorts on you know what people were to lost their mind I really think that I would have had a tremendous following and I think the guys today should do that if they have the freakiness you know use it to your advantage Instagram is in and YouTube make you guys money that that's your salary that's your contract nowadays there's no there's no magazine contracts there's no very few supplement contracts if you want to make money for yourself it's nice that you can you can put the oneness of making money in your own hands if you want to you know if you don't want to have to carry your phone around and take selfies of yourself you know what pay a guy like chai has and Larry wheels has had pay a guy to do it to be a video guy to your social media guy let him come to the gym with you film you so you don't have to even concentrate he could just do it while you're training you know and it doesn't allow you to have to be distracted you can still stay focused on your workout but yet you can still get great content for your social media channels and you know kai greens got someone who films him too and I mean he's got great stuff on there he doesn't even put up that much stuff but when he puts up stuff they get millions and millions of likes are it because he's a freak and that's what people want to see interesting one here from one to all a couple of joe what pro buy builder have you seen become successful say top five and pro show yes it in matter where who started with the worst genetics I'll rephrase it as I guess in your opinion top body over some overcame bad genetics you know I don't know if I don't think there's any real like pro body bulls out that who had bad genetics I think there might have been guys that were not that you might have thought hey this guy is not going to ever look the way he did but then all of a sudden like one or two years you know later he puts on like you know you know a hundred pounds of muscle I mean they're walking when you know wasn't you know a phenom you know he put a ton of muscle on you know over the course of you know a couple years there were guys that just crawled that woodwork and like we were like when did these guys come from I mean look at who would have thought that William bone act would look the way he did when he first started he was a two twelve guy and he couldn't even win two twelve shows the extra Jackson was a bannamway I mean this this guy that made humongous game I mean I look like I was nothing you know when I first started I put a hundred pounds of muscle on in five years so that's these are things that you never expect I was told by a lot of people don't waste your time you're never going to be a top body bullder because you don't have that you don't have the structure for it and so I superseded that by putting on a lot of muscle and being very conditioned so never I always tell people never allow people to tell you you can't do something okay use that as motivation to prove them wrong and there's been a lot of guys that they fit that category I you know I I had to sit down and actually you know think about it for a minute but this plenty of people that that I think a that made it bodybuilding and people never expected them to be where they were they just to achieve the level of of greatness that I mean look at even Steve Cucalo I mean he he progressively got better and better and better he didn't win teenagers when he did it okay I think you want his class but you know he didn't win the overall he might even suck and he just got better and better and better and kept him pretty stolen proving and he's proven to everyone that he is the real deal so like I said there's so many people out there that that that maybe when they first started we're nothing and then because of their work ethic became great to put a shan water fit been seeing some insulin protocols that call for shooting around two units first thing in the morning before doing a fasted cardio whole premise is to lower blood glucose levels to be more in a fat burning mode is this accurate and if so what's specific relationship does lower blood glucose levels have with fat loss when you're doing cardio and you're low intensity cardio your body using fat as a fuel source so whether your blood sugar is 90 when you wake up where your blood sugar is 70 or 65 okay that's not going to affect how much fat you lose so it's a it's a ludicrous fucking theory okay not not to mention who wants to have low blood sugar while they're while they're on a cardio machine and just getting that cold sweat going on you lips go numb it's it's moronic anywhere it takes insulin before they train is is is is idiotic I'm telling you it's it's it's it's foolish because the people who do it for their way train and thinking they're going to be a carb dot more and they got to feed that insulin and I've had this this argument with me loash before um I don't mind post insulin post work at insulin but pre-work at insulin is silly if you're doing a shot of insulin in the morning what you're breakfast to car be self-up so that when you go hit the gym for hours later you feel you feel pumped that's fine but you don't think a shot before you go into the gym okay actually you don't take a shot before you go on and get on a bike or a treadmill and do your fast at cardio in the morning that's nuts that's just stupidity as far as I'm concerned let's go to uh just trying to get the quick one here Eccano Joe uh that it uh your best white fish for diet you know the probably the most popular white fish of people eat is tolopy which is probably the least healthy because it's all farm raised and you know they feed it stuff you know they feed it like corn based you know foods which is not which changes all the good fats and in the fish most of these tolopy are living and disgusting you know fish tank conditions where they're basically in the they're basically swimming in their poop so I I don't need to lobby even though it tastes good it tastes like chicken why does it taste like chicken is we feed it the same thing we feed the chickens corn so if I had to pick you know a white fish I would pick the wild you know caught ones like you know if you live a long island you can get flounder and and and fluke that's really good I really like those cod is really good hadic is all right you know the wild caught one um if you go to like Sam's club or some of these price clubs you can buy like frozen you know wild caught fishes um that they have usually it's like cod and that that I I think cod tastes the best of all the white fishes um it's it's tasty you can get it readily in the wild court form watch out for those farm raised fishes they're just not as good for you health wise now you know macro nutrient wise protein fat carbs it's the same thing so you can eat to lobby or you're gonna lose weight and something that because it's the same thing but for a mental health standpoint if you're gonna be eating that much fish you might as well eat stuff that has good stuff in it because you can get nowadays you can get frozen caught frozen wild caught just as easily as you can get the frozen you know farm raised just you gotta do some smart chopping in other words you gotta ask questions you gotta read labels some people just blindly grab whatever's there or whatever's cheapest and that's not always the way to go for a dollar more you can get you know a wild caught and I would always choose wild caught if I had the option let's go to Billy G Finn another good one here this is post contest um how to reset your sleep cycle after a contest some three weeks post show and still waking up at 334 a yeah you know I try to eat something before you go to bed so you'll it'll let you rest a little nicer what happens is after shows you're metabolism is rev and so crazy that your body wakes up because it's just hungry no matter how much you eat before bed you'll wake up hungry just you just to happen to me all the time and it could take could take a month or so months to months before your body actually regulated self um you could get up in the middle of the night and you're at the shake you know maybe so you can go back to sleep you know readily I used to do the ice a lot of night shakes you know because for me it was like an easy way to get protein down I got up to take up you know to go pee I would have a shake there my refrigerator I had to use to keep a little refrigerator in my room I'd go up the shake down you know and go back to bed and then wake up and that would kind of like buy me some time so to speak so I wouldn't be starving laying in bed and that's the the the the best day I could help you so you could to eat before you go to bed and then have a shake available in in case you wake up in the middle of the night you can drink and then you can go back to sleep because remember sleep is really important especially off season if you're trying to put muscle on you got to sleep enough let's go to search at arms time for a couple more questions as an over 50 classic physical competitor is there a certain age or are there certain drugs you would recommend staying away from because of their sign effects or do you feel it's more dose related than age you know I think over is you know over the age of 30 I wouldn't even I would not use any more orals and I'm talking I'm not doing my anamorph first of all I don't think I should use anamorph anyway it's too weak and but if you take in like windshield tabs you know the last six weeks that's fine I'm talking like harder orals like an amdrawl or Diana ball have a test and even I don't know if I would well most people take out tests only for two weeks but I would not use the harder oral drugs I think that they're unnecessary the injectables do everything the orals do and this very little toxicity associated with longer acting injectables that's something I would probably stay away from I'd also keep very close tabs on my blood pressure a lot of drugs like tremble on raised blood pressure up especially in guys that are older so you gotta keep an eye on that you know because because if you high blood pressure will destroy your kidneys we know that already so we don't want that to happen other than that you know I think that you know you have to come to grips of the fact that it's 50-something years old you're probably not going to put a lot more muscle on so thinking that oh I'm going to take 2,000 milligrams of testosterone a week and then some amount of ox on top of that with the ton of GH it's probably overkill at that point because you're probably not going to be able to put more significantly more muscle on like you did when you were in your 20s and early 30s so taking that in that idea of mine that you you can keep your dosage is more reasonable okay because taking utils of drugs is not going to do anything if anything it's probably going to hurt you because an older body can't handle those drugs as well as a young person the young person has better detoxification they deliver works better their kidneys work better why put the body on unnecessary stress what isn't even doing anything to benefit you so I think once you can come to grips with that that concept of hey you know when I'm 50 I can make some gains but I'm not going to make ridiculous gains so why I'm not going to put myself in a situation where I'm going to really talk to find my body a lot. It's questions from a trade bit odd he references AJ since we're by the way Dave we're going to have on forgot to tell you this we're going to have him on I think I would just want to read you guys in a couple of weeks I hope risks to this specific date Justin Rodgers of course looking phenomenal we actually posted a proxpertor he sent to us a couple of nights ago he is three and a half weeks out from the Chicago. The question is about keeping it as bodybuilder is keeping stomach acidity in check how it one fix it and in a sense will it have a significant effect on a bodybuilder's physique. Being overly acidic obviously is not good for your body because if your body is overly acidic it's not going to be concerned with burning fat and building and repairing muscle it's going to be worried about trying to balance the pH of the body so you can do stuff like at brags apple cider vinegar which is an unfiltered apple cider vinegar table spoon that two three to five times a day in six to eight ounces of water that'll help neutralize a lot of acidity in the body taking a good greens product like I usually recommend people take juice plus I've been using that for 25 years I have a link on Davepalumma.com if you want to see what I'm talking about I do the fruit and vegetable you know the fruit in the morning the vegetable pills at night and that also helps with neutralization of acidity drinking alkaline is water can help as well in between your meals not with meals of course because that's like I've do anything and you know just allowing your body to detox you know I offer a free three week detox cleanse program that I've written I've given that to thousands of people already what you got to do is email me and I'll send you a copy of it. Doing that once a year let your bodies organs of digest and get a break reducing all the toxic you know and acidifying foods in your diet you know for that three week period allows your body to cleanse itself and so I think as long as you can do that and understand that you can't keep bombarding the body without giving it a reprieve or a break I think it'll be fine but that's you know those are the little tricks that I've used over the years to try to neutralize the city using a good five or something like fiber-liced to help remove waste from the body the longer waste sits in your colon okay the more likely you are to re-reabsorb the toxins in that way so the quicker it moves three of body using a good five or supplement you have less likely of a chance of re-absorbing the toxins last question is from the classic physique Nash going back to Europe career when you were walking around 275 to 300 plus mass monster back in the day what kind of reactions would you get from the ladies he says the question is that's what I'll split it into two obviously there is the ladies in the fitness industry obviously they're going to be a little bit more used to seeing the mass monster but the non-fitness related you walking around at Roosevelt field more kind of leave you the action I think that most people were probably horrified by the way I like to be honest yeah I think most women would think it was it was disgusting I would think you know the people in our industry probably thought it was cool because they can relate to it and they can appreciate it but I think for the average person you know walking around at 300 pounds you know just was like I was a monster like the incredible Hulk walking around you know now there's always the peat the the groupy you know girls that like that kind of a look they like the big freaky body builders the must-you're a look that's something that for whatever reason that they like you know but I think the majority of people you know didn't like it I'll tell you why because my lost a lot of weight and when I walk around now and people who knew me from before and after a lot of people tell me a lot at least women will say oh you look so much better now okay so we think women are attracted to like big freaky guys but for the majority of them they don't give us should have you look women are women more care more about your personality and if you have a good job then if you if you have 25 inch arms you know and that's just the reality I think more guy I had more guys that were way more impressed like when I would go to shows I didn't have groups of women around my both I had tons of guys wanting to know how I got big and I had a million questions for me and then anything I had groupy guys that were like interested in learning from me and finding out what secret to had and what drugs they took and what foods I ate and how I trained that was really I think the majority of the people that were grouping around me the women could carry less about most of them you know like I said unless there was like someone who really women that were just really into muscle you know but this that was a minority not a majority so chicks take the long ball but not 300 combat spots right is the oral of Dave's tour yeah I think if I if I think I've had like you know a better jump shot I think I had a word out of the chat and on that note it's gonna do for this episode of Ask Dave again a reminder if you haven't already subscribed hit the subscribe but low we have tons and I mean tons of interviews right now on our us muscle.com and of course the YouTube channel I am rage of lead priest lead priest responding to Kenny KO if you haven't watched it you're not gonna want to miss it episode is absolutely absolutely hilarious for Dave Lobbo and a producer Tyler Shore Obsidian for OGeek we'll see you next time
