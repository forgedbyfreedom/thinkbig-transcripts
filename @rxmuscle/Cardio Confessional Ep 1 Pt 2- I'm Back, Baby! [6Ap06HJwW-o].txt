Oh, I'm back baby. That's right. New brand new series of cardio professionals To help motivate me hopefully and maybe you I got actually a lot of good feedback On the whole last set of cardio professionals Leading up to the branch for war in classic in my men's physique debut So of course now that I decided to do another show and continue on and Iron Mag Lab is a graciously Allow me to continue on with them representing their company providing me a supplements I'm continuing on with this whole journey with the new set of cardio professionals and And first I'm gonna talk a little bit about the continuing along with Iron Mag Labs and the decision to continue doing this and doing another show And then I'll talk a little bit about motivation or the lack thereof in my case So the decision to continue on was based upon the fact that I had such a good time Doing it doing the contest preparing up to the contest The dieting process the whole thing I really enjoyed it and I really had no regrets and You know even I didn't place in the top five which I would like to so I had a qualified I still had a great time and I really I really wasn't was kind of almost said it was all over now I also had such good feedback from people industry people People with their listen to the radio shows that watch the cardio professionals even even they've Plumbo gave me some props and if you know Dave it's about as hard to get a compliment out of Dave as it is Anybody I mean you almost Get a compliment from the wall easier than you get one from Dave Blumbo so for him to Be complimentary and even to endorse me continuing on Was just one of the signs that made me want to continue doing this so Now let's bring fast forward to right now This is the first day dieting again I'm a little under 240 pounds if you remember last time I was two 66 right around In the two sixties I think the first cardio professional does 250 or something I already started dieting So I'm starting considerably smaller In fat mass really I think the in reality I am More lean muscle tissue Then I did because I had such a good rebound after the context I'm really if you look back You go look at my face and everything from this cardio conventional number one of series two compared to number one of one And you'll see you know I'm nowhere near as holding the water fat and everything else that I was the last time around so With the goal the goal is to be five to ten pounds tighter So that's the keyword tighter not necessarily smaller and not trying to lose a bunch of muscle You know and really I talked to Ted at Dietcote who's helping me again this time video a phenomenal job advising me last time I listened to his diet and because I cut the calories faster than I would on my own in the carbs Because of Ted's advice I look the way that you guys saw that I looked So I mean Ted don't want to focus too much on the weight on the scale this time I think that I think maybe that would be that was my my focus more than anything More more so even than tads Now this time we're not gonna focus this silly in the scale we're gonna go warm looks The guidelines that I've been given was five to ten pounds less So That's what I'm gonna shoot for even though the numbers aren't necessarily important that really the goal To give you an idea of the look that we're looking for Is we want the seratus and obliques to have stuff going on Not just the ads my abs are always good they're good right now and If you looked my conditioning was fine If you looked at some of the top guys who went pro this year the difference between my condition in the Acidition was their seratus and obliques when they twist you saw a lot of stuff going on there In mine You saw some but it wasn't as dry or tight Is some of the top guys that are doing it so that's really the goal and hopefully obviously you can't pick and choose where the The five pounds comes out of but ideally That's where you'll see me tighter this time around Now Let's talk about motivation After the diet after my lab the contest I really could have continued on very easily right after that It wouldn't have been that difficult for me. I was like in the right frame of mind Now since then I told you I'm not much fatter just bigger Maybe holding a probably a 10 pounds of water which I'm assuming I'll drop Pretty quick from cutting out the carbs and stopping the junk food. I'm gonna be honest with you all I have been doing the opposite of what I was doing the tad and And kind of revered it back to my old Diet the typical geobac a diet which is McDonald's cakes pies Ice cream Dairy products Nobody building food whatsoever No lean meat no rice No vegetables nothing good which I can't say I'm proud of I haven't been doing the cardio like I thought I was gonna do Basically Other than the weight training Which has hasn't been a hundred percent there have been weekends or I missed completely three or four days I didn't train in a row because of shows being out of town etc So I haven't I haven't really stuck with things like I would like to have so now I'm doing kind of even I don't look like it I'm kind of going from Zero to 60 again like I did last time And mentally It's not as easy to go from zero to sixly Is it just stopping the food and start doing the cardio again? So I'm gonna wear a place I met the gym doing cardio and for the first time in a long long time I don't really want to be and I didn't really want to do the diet this morning I still had some donuts left I mean I was looking really hard at those donuts this morning It was the toughest it's been It's a cycle remember To avoid the donuts and make egg whites instead So I feel like it's gonna be challenging for the first few weeks until I develop a habit again of doing the right things You know So this is gonna be I'm gonna let you guys All like you know how this goes the challenge goes I've actually Getting back on the diet and doing the things I need to now that I'm in the gym doing the cardio it's not that bad But getting in here today was harder than it usually isn't staying on the diet hasn't been Hasn't been funded all so Hopefully the fun will come back into this You know I'm doing cardio pretty easy real it relatively easy I'm starting out Ted starting out with 70 minutes of cardio right off the bat Which is not uh not what I was hoping for or expecting so I've got a lot of cardio right off the bat. I'm starting with relatively low carbs You know we're doing a carb cycling diet like we did before I am having a cheat meal on Saturdays my chat my I do have one higher carb day But most of my carbs are around 150 grams a day So It's gonna be tough But I know that I can do it And my goal is He's in an already say Texas state which middle of October I'm looking at it about eight weeks to go to the show I don't think I'll have any problem getting down Assuming I you know mentally Focus in like I need to and then Hopefully I do what I need to do to qualify four weeks later will be national's in Miami And They give away three pro cards In my high class It sounds pretty crazy and you can talk about stuff like that But man it would be really cool If I could get a pro card I never imagined a million years that have I be pro cards or anything So I would love to be To be able to take that pro card on my wallet and show it to Dave Pulumball every once in a while when he yells at me into to show him Who's the IPP pro here not you buddy? I think they would almost just from material for the radio show to fuck with Dave It would almost just be worth it for that so fingers crossed I've been doing I need to do over here I want to give a big big thank you to Robert to Masjo Iron Mag Labs for believing in me Continuing sponsoring me Continuing allowing to me to be their national spokesperson For a great company that provides Supplements that really do work no bullshit.
