3, 2, 1. Welcome back to live with Brought to you by species nutrition on Dave Palombo and it is really an honor now to have on the show our Tampa Pro men's open champion is first pro win in his first pro try on to LeBrona. Welcome back to the show. Hey Dave, thanks for having me on again, man. I'm starting to like how infrequently we talk because we're only talking when the show's right. That I'm not going to talk a lot. I don't feel we'll be able to talk a lot more about it in a couple years. Yeah, we're talking very frequently because you've been winning a lot. Now let me ask you this question. I mean your dad wins his pro debut. You win your pro debut. A lot of similarities there. You know being undefeated as a pro your first shot out has got to feel pretty good. Man honestly it really does you know I know no entrain is not to win every one trains to win but you know it's one of those things the entire time was training for the contest and it truly believed with every bone in my body you know as long as it worked hard and you know do what I need to do with all the plan and execute that I would win when I truly believe that the entire time. So it was really cool to you know have that belief come to fruition. I really feel like it bolstered my confidence a lot coming into the pro ranks and it was a honest man the whole weekend the whole week was like a dream come true. It was like kind of like fairy tale to me just like everything that happened you know leading up to the show how the show and how like it was it was really cool man it was a very cool experience. The funny thing is you'll probably remember this win beyond all the wins whatever you get in the future because what happens is they all start to merge together but you never forget the first one. Yeah. Now let me ask you a question because I love to ask people the question because when I would compete and I've said this before on interviews I would look at my pictures after the show no matter how good I did even if I won and I won a throw up like I would see every flaw in my physique I wouldn't see the good stuff I would just say you know what everyone else says he looks great but I I'm missing here and I'm missing there. Did you really say that you said that so this morning was the first morning I went to the PC news online and looked at my stage shots from Tampa I drove and you know how I was like normally like you see like people sell a sticker that you start seeing all the good professional photographers pictures and then the then then your actual stage shots drop and you see I mean you're like and you know this morning was the first time where most of them I was still like but you know there were a couple of I was like okay I can work with that. Finally I know like I see stage shots that I'm actually so much pleased with and you're not saying so yeah it's never satisfied I don't think anybody will ever satisfied. Yeah I'm not introducing. When you when you look at yourself in the last time you got on stage when you went national what do you think you made the biggest improvements in over that course that year? It was it was a year and I like nine months actually and I feel like I like look like I hate myself all over if I'm being honest you know the scale says the same thing national before I walked over the finals I was 229 pounds right um the be morning of the show this year I was 249 and then I walked over there I was 247 right before we walked over so you know good good solid I was definitely a leader for the show the nationals as well so I couldn't have been happier at the progress we made you asked specifically where to I think I made it specifically where I needed to make it that's no secret but from the waist down I'm pretty complete and pretty there in terms of the mass and stuff I needed from the waist up and I feel like I did put on quite a bit of the size and the time frame that I had from the waist up and especially in the back and something I'm really looking forward to continuing to improve on because you know at the timeline that I had this last year I really only had about three months of really trying to push the envelope and get new growth you know that I had my surgery I recovered from my surgery I got back for it. I was telling you how ever you want what you had what injured and and how that went because I think a lot of you had an injury you dealt with that was you know pretty pretty severe a required surgery. Yeah so I've said in a bunch of interviews so I had a like boiled down a little like 30 second high-light reel what happened 14 years old got tackled from behind came down on the shoulder broke my arm up here dislocated at the same time blew out my transverse humor element so looking at the poles the long head of the bicep in the bicep little groove from the time I was 14 until 26 it was basically just riding in and out of the groove rubbing itself in half it started to really presenting it painful after I won junior USA's I thought it was just kind of an impingement like getting back like from the show getting hydrated thing never got better when it got the MRI on it and that's when it was presented as okay well you have some pretty bad degenerative stuff going on in your bicep tendon and we're gonna okay well is it something we can push through it is something you need surgery I saw three doctors two said and surgery one said let's do it the one that said let's do it I liked the most obviously but the one that said was also the orthopaeducing Texans so I trusted his opinion we went through it you know PRP toward all whole nine yards for nationals didn't really train upper body much you know couldn't do a bicep curl couldn't overhead press all machine work for chest is very limited finish the show had to have the surgery thought I was gonna try and get a better therodry for three months and I was really focused on his letting my body heal didn't happen had the surgery woke up from the surgery and the doctor says so if it presented the way that it actually was I mean MRI I would have told you don't go to the gym the next day because he said it was like holding on by like a thread so you like it in terror actually yeah I'm I'm very very blessed didn't tear so because of the fact that I had it repaired instead of blue and blowing it up it's literally exactly the same as it was and it's the same size you know it's exactly the correct it's perfect instead of you know exploding it and then having to go in there and fish it wouldn't have been the same so it would have been a career and they're honestly so feel very blessed to not have that happened but that's what I want to show you so I have my shoulder fixed that bicep 10 and got drilled into the bicep little groove I had some rotator cuff stuff cleaned up and I think that actually needed sutures or anything though and my AC joined the bridal then yeah that was it so wait for it once we take it to 50 like I like I yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you don't hold or replace but that that who cares you're you're you're really now do I just I need another 10 years of another you can help them you know it's funny because there's a lot shoulder injuries are really common in body you know honestly it's it's a busking in the career it's the most mobile joint in your body obviously so you know it's with that mobility and then with what we do you know if they screw them inside first your feet both the muscles they have the tendons that all that mobility it needs space to move around and you just take that space away over the years obviously the bigger you get and yeah because of the problem for those big guys eventually and most of your really conscious of a for sure and some people you know like I had like I had too much space in my mind my joint like it's not too short because you have been crazy heavyweight you did grinding in there and that's you know that's why I think my shoulder joints didn't last as long you know all good though you know what you did the right thing and you know a lot of people don't want to go through that process I can't tell you how many people I talked to you it was one of the first things I've ever done in my life you know you don't know for surgery because I like it because you got to think about let me think the picture before I have never had surgery before I never been under anesthesia before I had just one national 2019 was my year that I was supposed to spend you know I'd go around the country I guess posing seeing everyone I have them fun having my year to go over for my protein view and instead I spent it at my house so I've deeped up for four months in an arm swing so it was hard but you know if you end up the day it's what needed to happen at the end of the day you know not a perspective on things and then the end of the day it's a lot of me to get healthy to the phone rank and train exactly like I want to you know people are blown away by this crazy progress this crazy progress happened the four months of healthy training I think those gonna happen big long offseason after I do the end it's gonna be fun I'll put this out here I'm gonna make this much progress between the series between last year and the series and we'll just do this year next year which is you know 10 to 15 times the same way but I'm making heaven you know like I said I and I and it happened to my career too but they have a solid like you know offseason like of training when your healthy is and your focus and you have the ability to live that bodybuilding lifestyle there's nothing you can't make it everything and everything everything everything everything everything everything's done everything's done it's crazy I'm a progress like you make think about Dorian the progress we made from 92 to 92 or a lot yeah or cry when they made the crazy leaps it was because everything just kind of worked out perfectly now going into this year's Olympia being your first Olympia is it is a little nerve-racking a few I know obviously with the crash on you but but it still has to be pretty amazing thing they hit your first year out there you know like it's been it's been so like it kind of hit me when I want to tell you okay you're looking at qualified you're going to the Olympia like I told myself that and then it's like it's been a whirlwind but yesterday so I forget what paid us on I'm gonna saw the Olympia qualified list you know and the Olympia qualified list you know like I'm reading and it's like you know like fill he's making a dash you know James Lewis how do you pay and you know roll you in clear William Benach and then there's Hunter LeBron at the bottom and I'm like these are guys of an ointment like the last like five or seven years since it's that kind of made it set in and see like a little surreal for sure so as far as pressure goes ahead and into it you know I had a really interesting conversation with my mom and dad about this about you know what it's like going into the first one and I can't tell you how much how you know in a good headspace I am with it because of the fact that I won Tampa before Tampa I had never lost I've never lost his name I'm not sure I won I did five shows I won the overalls of four of them it's crazy I'm free of them and into it and we're national level shows so you know head in the Tampa I had never lost before and you know I was very much able to maintain that mindset you know throughout prep you know the handle your business and you're not gonna lose you can't lose you know so I took that with me to Tampa I did what I did in Tampa I have that mindset and tap now head it into the Olympia it's it's not it's not a possibility to win it your first time it's just they're absolutely isn't it possibly the winning first time it's never been done it won't be done it is what it is right so with that pressure of you know like you give you the winning remove I can focus entirely on you know bringing this the absolute best package that I can bring and you know really I feel like I'm gonna be able to bring something that I'll be able to stay next to some guys and you know be like oh okay he does belong there you know especially with the time that I'll have starting crap for the Olympia very lean you know I'm one of those people that can definitely grow into shows so my body feels very healthy right now and we're still you know fresh off a show and I feel healthy so I'm really excited for what I think I'll be able to bring in the improvements I'll be able to show let me ask you this question because a bunch of people you know as soon as you win everyone loves you and then it's then they also want to also deconstruct you and figure out what's wrong with you the pectare you have a little bit of a pectare on the left pecta a lot of people comment the other we all have a little we all have a little beatings here and they're what what happened had that happened and that happened before I even started body balloon that happened when I was 19 years old which it was basically man and I'll put this out there to everyone if you're a bodybuilder don't do flat bench press I agree the day the day that I did one 35 for 20 185 for 20 225 for 15 275 for 15 315 for 12 365 for 10 and the first wrap on the eccentric before of I did it. Is this the terrible exercise yeah it's a me it doesn't look bad I don't know I I think a lot of people just making a big deal because they're trying to find some little chink in your arms. There's been a long time since we've had a mystery one peo that I don't say that I Dorian had to turn by some for quite a period. I don't know if you can have a little thing here in there for sure and you know one of those things too that it looked so much worse a year or two ago than it does now because I couldn't push hard on that side from the shoulder the amount of tissue that I've added around that time for the last four months it's going to become more and more and more and more and more of a not as few as time goes on people don't even know the tissue that I'll be able to add around and do the fact that everything else is healthy. People will realize also it's not a tendent hair it's an intermuscular tear and people get those all the time and it can't tell you how many times I'm in the gym and I'm you know like you said bring in the way down and you feel that little separation you stop you put the way down and then you know you get a little little divot you know you're a hair you know it happens to everyone and it doesn't you know it's like to be truthful if you haven't had I had two different than just come up to me and say normally it's not like that about to me but it doesn't affect your flow at all and it really won't hurt you in the lottery. So yeah that was really nice to hear too because honestly you're just something that's on my mind especially after this week it gives a big hit a lot of attention but you know like you said Aaron like I said there hasn't been really any mr. Olympia that hasn't had something you know so yeah I was backstage at the gym in the USA speaking of junior say 94 and Gary striam bruise. Okay Kevin lover and what yeah like to be really like yeah I'm very sure I didn't was guest-posing it was warm it was that he was like pumping up backstage with like 60 pound dumbbell flies or 50 pound dumbbell flies and unlike well it's Gary striam bruise dude I can do it. I don't know what possessed me to pick these dumbbells up and do it and I tweak my pack and you know what backstage like before a show backstage pumping up for junior I say I'm like what wrong with I was so mad I was so mad I was so mad I said about this I got a little different from it though that you know what I never ever for the rest of my career ever pumped up backstage in weight I would only pose and I think that's one of the biggest mistake people make is over pumping backstage absolutely you know you can go to just as much blood in the muscle from posing but posing goes all the water in too so what am I doing you're in shape all you have to do is is pose backstage you get the blood flow that's it you don't get the blood going and get the water these guys are doing like an hour workout backstage I don't understand you know so anyway but it's all great. I let me ask you a question obviously Ian Valier and you were battling first and second I don't know what had happened to Ian who his turn wasn't good he was like you were like the epitome of like polish and and that's what you should be and he looked like who was like something was just off I don't know if he was sick or what but it just goes to show you how important you know that whole presentation is that's a me guy and a got from your dad like you know presentation and wait you know it's something they definitely got from my dad but then it's something that I've always kind of ever since I've started bodybuilding it's never really made much sense to me to not have things that are completely under your control to go completely right you know my my color heading into a show that's completely under my control I made sure weeks and events that the girl that always tans me can be there and I proteins always done my tan I've never had anything else on you've always done in the same process it's always come out the same it's a very you know like just like you don't know I don't stress about my tan because I did the homework kind you know and like you know at any level that should be something that's done you know you you something is completely under your control you know the same way like you're trumps fitting all right the same way the trunk color being flattering you know the same way you know like getting your water in every day during peak week like all these things that can make a huge huge difference that are perfectly under your control you know it's it's it's it's it's it's unusual to show to show and be shaking like the leaf and out of breath after posing around it means you were just lazy like you skipped her it's like skipping cardio to make I don't know like you want white train hard to do in our cardio and diet and they basically kill yourself if you're not going to be able to present it it doesn't make any sense and you know and early in my career I was also guilty of that because like you know it was just I was so focused on the diet and the training and all that stuff there you know it's that reason on the east coast it's really funny I'm sorry interrupt you but I was saying the difference between me and my dad yeah obviously my dad is a huge person and presentation and that the posing team yeah I was one of those guys I was posing three and four rounds of days of my mandatory is because I know my mandatory is a little bit of a chance I needed to be able to make them through them and like I'm thinking okay you need to be able to post three rounds that your stomach go and like that in my mind where I have that that my posing's unlocked that's your me and my dad differ because he's like I'll be the first one to admit I've been kind of been more polished but I was spending all of my time in the little energy I did have in the final weeks make sure my mandatory is around the point that's where we end up with a little bit but we both believe yeah well you know what you're smart because they don't even care about the the posing round anymore evidently whereas when you dad competed that was like a big deal like now it's see my opinion that is why they say they don't score it judge this recruitment beings and so our audiences and it's human nature if someone presents something that really is beautiful and moves you and captivates you is as objective as you want to be you know it can't create things like all things were the same well he really did something you know at least I might not feel like that I could be that thing you know and if it comes down to that one level half percent and it's something that's in my control I'm gonna take it well I think you know and I said this many times before I think that you know Kai Green was probably one of the best free poses and the posing round but in the annitories while he had good endurance because he practiced so much with him because his mandatory is we're not that great I mean I think we've got to think about Kai's closing how beautiful and cool it was it was the transitions with the dynamic posing around him so cool that amount of muscle moving is fluidly and is dynamically as well as that's what made Kai's posing so awesome you're right but I'm just saying I don't I think he if he'd worked more in the mandatory that I think he might have beaten fill a couple times you know I think that fill was a little still a little more polished I don't know what she's got there bad I was so I can say about that I really find a lot wouldn't it be great if the two of them were on on the Olympian stage man one more time just so you can say I have it but I have the best seats in the house yeah let's talk to me a little bit about third place competitor Duane yeah a lot of people super duper duper duper impressive like super impressive and I really get the internet you know like way of doing that robbed I can understand where it's coming from especially whenever the shot like this is floating around you know this front last thread was the best front front front front on the stage by far he just a freak in the fact that he was going to be doing 2012 until four weeks out and I decided to do open like I got it to my hat to the guy for sure I was just you're ready and no that's got you to know that that I heard that from a couple people I his coaching and decided that they weren't going to squeeze down to 2012 for a week suddenly that's crazy you know that being said if you're objective when you turn us around I feel like he needs a little bit more hamstrings to be truly competitive in the open class I feel like his body's really good but I feel like he doesn't need a little bit more hamstring and you know coming from 2012 like that's something he can fit so he really quickly you know so I think this guy's the limit for that guy he's got some crazy crazy genetics of shoulders that front last thread's nutty nutty nutty nutty so yeah I was very impressed with him he seems like a good dude too yeah and I tell people look first of all I wasn't at the show and I never judge a show if I'm not there because you know what when you you get to see these guys on stage together your stage presence and you have been to an avati living shows you know pictures or not it's a non-sarvey you can't go out and I'm not and I'm not being racist at all but black eyes look better in pictures because no that's that because their body the shadows but they take out so you got to be in that front row with the judges judge and you know what alone in pictures he looks great and if he puts on another 1015 pounds he's going to be dangerous but you won that show I mean there's no doubt about that I mean I would agree with you I respectfully say I agree with you yeah I mean you you just you dominate that lineup and you know it's it's nice to see you know I think you're you're the feel good story because you know people what like the whole legacy of your family and they they want to see you do well just like we want to see Sergio leave a genie do well because because of his dad and everyone loves his dad as well so to see you guys following in your dad's footsteps and create your own legacy is like something like it's a fan dream because we can see dad on stage anymore we can't see others in third year as dad is not even alive anymore but if we can see that next generation of guys that are taking what their dad did and taking it even to the next level I mean to me as a fan of the sport taking myself out of the forest can't get enough of that it has to be nice to you it says no all right here's here's the question I want how tall is he dad my dad is five five okay I I think he's shrinking I know I shrunk it like at least I will say this I will say this I do think he was fact six a long time I really do I really all jokes aside he is six years old and I really do think he's got my little shard yeah we all we all shrink dance from all this cutting over the years and you're and you're five not right I'm every bit of five nine over five nine not five ten but I'm over five oh yeah and you weighed what you weighed the day of the show I weigh in 240 nine when I woke up and I believe it was like 247 before I walked it unbelievable okay and I think you I think your body can probably hold another 15 pounds I think I think I could hold another 15 from the waist up yes now yeah I'm gonna let you off I know you got to stop you today my last question is Lee priest on my last show I did with him on Iron Age I asked him about you know your potential he feels that you can be Mr Olympia one day what when you hear like a guy like Lee priest say that what does that mean to you man to be completely honest with you I've had quite a few people of his you know like statue gravitas if you will you know reach out to me privately kind of saying things along the lines of that you know I've said the same thing as you know someone asked me like oh fucks wheeler said said that you can be the next Mr Olympia two and it's like I'll say this to hear you come from people like Lee priest or flux wheeler that they believe I have that potential like it is the biggest honor in the world to me you know that being said you know they say about potential it's a big asshole and you know what else they say how many how many all this because future Mr Olympia is in good you know there be 300 Mr Olympia's right you know so at the end of the day it's surreal having people like that say about me but I know it's just a whole until I throw it off course I'm a look at Dennis Newman Dennis Newman won the the USA everyone said this guy's you still won't be got the key to the brewery yeah I try brewer all right there's you know again his and they make big flashes and they come and you know this sports America that's great I think people like that you're a young guy coming up and you're one of the few guys with potential we haven't seen any new people who who emerge with such potential it's such a young age and I think that excites people we want to see the new the god I don't want to see the 40 year old guys winning the Olympia I want to see the new young guys I want to see you out you got us coming up you got us coming to me James Reagan yeah right here's a good crappy young dude coming up yeah there's a crappy young dude coming up well Hunter enjoy these spoils of your victory of course and I know you're Olympia preface probably gonna be starting up in a couple weeks but rest up and once again congratulations on the big one thank you Dave appreciate you have me I'm really absolutely you want to have you want to thank anyone or call anything yeah no let me say something
