people don't want to see you do too well you know how that is you know yeah that's true you know and again i'm not necessarily democratic or a public in the minute i don't want to sound so party heavy i'm really not but i do think it's the as a media just being to particular picture and how people just believe it and you know i have a lot of really strange that when i was growing up and um you know and i've seen interviews with my dad when i was you know at a college i interned with him for six months and and i was with them all the time literally and i watched the interviews that he did that were taped and then i saw how they were edited together and how they aired later and it was amazing how they would reach you and read edit and re-package to content to make my dad see you know so much more out of control than he was in the interview i mean the interviewer would even re-hute and they'd already been very calm asking these questions when appears as oh my dad's just incredibly aggressive monster coming after him when in reality in the interview this guy was being you know such a cure for injury day killer yes they they do that all time every time anytime i've ever been on like the slowest snippets i've been on tv interviews they always they always ask you the the most potent inappropriate question because that that's all they're interested in the answer they don't want anything they don't want to know the truth they want to know that they're looking to find out because they have a story and a lot of times too when company there people get called for comment the writer is already written story they're just looking for a quote that they can put into the story right they're not really looking for what happened or what your point of view is or come in and meet the people they just want to quote it's all sensationalism and again not all of it but a lot of it is and you know it a lot of people don't know that you can't educate the entire public as to how the media does that i actually went to communication college so i learned a lot about how to do that even just in college they keep you so it's you know the media is tricky moving forward into the future because this is my and as some I like you guy and he got stuff to do and then you're taking time out of your new year's data talk to me moving forward are you your brother your husband triple age will you guys be the future of the WWE will you be running it you know 10 20 years or now i mean is that is that the goal right now i mean you're assuming that my dad is at some point not to be able to run the company at some point you dad might say i i want to retire yeah i'm a no no no no no no he'll never want to retire but i think you know ultimately that would be our goal you know if we um if we were able to that would certainly be our goal that we would love to take over the company one day but again we got a long way to go and we got to prove ourselves and we got a lot of the learned so we'll see what happens well you guys you might dad want to retire by the way you know you all really all have to carry on the cast it never ever probably i'll live both of you too he might i've never seen so take better care than self-dnew dad i'm pretty crazy i fell into in a great way but yeah you see i i'm i'm look he lives the lifestyle so everyone around them can never criticize and for anything because he he's doing as much work as everyone else there and he's training hard and so i mean how did you how did you be mad at what's going on when they tell you to do something and they're doing it ten times more than what they tell and you that's what i try to do i try to stay in better shape than everyone i get more to serve so i think and i work harder than everyone that's like i i model myself after your dad and i love you you know hey i love you that definitely i love his work ethic i love the fact that he takes chances based on his own intuition and creativity and you know you guys have a tremendous a tremendous accomplishment you know it's it's always great to see and i'm sure you've grown up seeing it the fact that you know your dad built something that no one believed could could ever happen now you guys are taking over and and helping to contribute to that uh you're going to be launching this new WWE final network channel and that'll be on one of the cable channels yep but that's going to be amazing now what you guys move like raw over to that channel or will it still be on USA and and those kind of things you know they like just think of a way
