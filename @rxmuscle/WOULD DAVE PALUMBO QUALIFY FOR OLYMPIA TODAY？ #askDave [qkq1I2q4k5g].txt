All right, I still have vision on rxmuscle.com. This has been a great video. As hashtag, as Dave, you're 30 minute question and answer show with Dave Plumbo. I'm your host, Steve Furuki. This is your forum. Task anything in everything, diet training, nutrition, news inside and of course outside the body building world. That's been out bringing Dave Plumbo. You just wrapped up a one-hour interview with Ian Valier. Now, this is someone we've been meeting to get on for quite some time. We wanted to get a mum before the tempo probe. He was very, very wrapped up in his prep. You wanted to get him on to talk about what happened in the tempo probe. Or it's finishing runner up to Hunter LeBrata. If you want to get the audience a little primer before you put it up on the channel. Yeah, you know, I had watched he had done an interview with a foot obvious, and he talked about the fact that the stress and the pressure of the show got him, and I could relate to that in terms of like, you know, sometimes people, you know, crumble. Not many people are like Jay Kotler that they have that mindset that's so absolutely powerful and doing something like that. I wanted to get into that and wanted to get into with him what bodybuilding meant him was it how important was it that he really enjoy competing or not He was very very it was a very honest interview He gave and I think people are gonna really enjoy it because I think people gonna be able to relate to it because I think one of the things that that came out Was the guys like Luke Sandow while they loved the bodybuilding they really enjoy the competition aspect of it as much because it was a lot of pressure for them And you know if you can't deal with pressure or if it doesn't become fun anymore You know sometimes you have to go with different direction, you know, and so that was one of the topic big topics We talked about in the interview and I think you guys will enjoy it and then take a look at it and You know because not everyone get everyone thinks wow if you're at the top level you know if you game You know you should love it. It should be great. I mean what it's not that easy when you get to that level People respond differently to stress Look at the actors some actors are Rock solid their whole entire career other actors they become super famous they make a ton of money And then they before you know it they're like arrested or something crazy happens to them or they die young So you got it you know everyone because everyone's a different type of individual and they we all respond to the stresses of life differently And that was it's a very important interview I think for all of us out there who bodybuild should watch because I think it's applicable to all of us Well as everybody knows and as anyone has seen Ian on our channel on other channels Really one of the more insightful minds and all of bodybuilding Bodybuilder himself but also a coach Best known coach to Chris Bonsett his brother-in-law But it is a very very very insightful look into his psyche so something that you know fans of bodybuilding and of course those who you know saw the the tempo approach transpired a couple of weeks ago wanted to see what was going through his mind then and after So much was made you know between pre-judging and finals and how I guess apparently he had deleted his Instagram So he talks about everything and it's a really really really In-depth interviews you're not gonna want to miss or win a put up on the channel tomorrow Thursday afternoon on rxmuscle.com and the rxmuscle youtube channel if you're watching us on youtube for the first time Hit the subscribe button below hit the notification bell So you don't miss any of our new content of our new uploads of course as soon as that interview goes up with Ian You're gonna see that as well if you like what you're watching hit the thumbs up button Comment below obviously it helps us a lot and as always we thank you for all of your support Let's go to the questions first two questions from at the day below my experience after first question Dave something you talk about quite often and the value of fat Well the question is why is fat essential for building muscle? You know that's a good it's a good question I've talked about it before but you know it's worth remanitioning here and revisiting and I think a lot of people feeling can think it's not relevant now I think a lot of people originally thought and myself included when I first started that That was just the fuel source essentially and that we really didn't need very much of it for bodybuilding purposes There was all about protein but when you think about all the hormonal aspects The steroidal hormones all the fat side hormones are made from fat in the body all of the cholesterol carriers HL LDLs made from fats Every membrane that surrounds every cell in the body also known as the cell membrane is made up of essential fatty acids and some saturated fatty acids So when you break down muscle tissue or and or you your body replenishes any any tissues that it breaks down whether the you know the internal intestinal lining you know the bodies in the constant state of remodeling okay but specifically in a very very high state of remodeling because of the fact that we're in the gym destroying Numerable amounts of muscle cells on a daily basis We need the building blocks of a fatty acids Specifically the poly and saturated fats the omega-freezen sixes because these are used to rebuild those membranes So not only is the protein component of the muscle cell broken now, but the cell membrane component is as well So if you want to maximize your gains in recovery You need to take in a certain threshold amount of fat now for each person is different It you know it usually body weight is the Dependent but some people have higher Requirements to not this I have a very high fatty acid requirement in my body I could eat you so much fat eight on the course I probably Almost as much fat as I approach in during the course of a day I just that I think my body uses fat as a fuel source really readily, but it also for repair purposes and Until I restore fact Okay to an optimal level in my body because I was one of these you know late 80s early 90s body bullies We ate Protein and carbs that was it and I could not grow I got stuck at a point and I couldn't gain any mass I told the story before about McDonald's and all this stuff, but The bottom line is you cannot deprive yourself of any essential nutrients in the body And that's why taking a essential fatty acid supplement like the Omega-Lized formula that I make from species nutrition is so vitally important At least if you take that you know you have the essential fatty acids that your body Absolutely needs and cannot turn cannot create on its own That alone will give you a piece of mind. Okay, you know what at least I'm not Sacrificing my ability to repair muscle because I don't have a central fatty acid So that's number one, but then you also need to intake and dietary fats once again because the more muscle you break down the higher the amount of fat You need to ingest as well because once again if you could if you need to if one person needs 200 grams of protein per day And another guy needs 400 to grow and repair then obviously the four-inch of gram protein guys Gonna need a lot more fat than the 200 gram protein guy because it's proportional So if you if you're breaking down double the muscle you're you need double the fat too So a lot of people just don't realize how how vital that is So probably from a body building standpoint now you're putting aside the health perspective from a body building standpoint of muscle growth and repair We need fat Second question again from the Dave Fulumbo experience app The question in itself is pretty simplistic so I'm gonna take it a step further The question is are cheap meals or refeeds needed in the off-season? I guess if you want to take it a step further if you want to add the benefits or value To cheat meals in the off-season. Yeah, you know for people who don't eat that clean in the off-season if they're probably not necessary But I was always such a clean eater and the reason why I ate clean in the off-season was it was not Had nothing good metabolism I could do anything the reason I cleaned is because if I ate too much junk or too much higher sugar foods or higher fat You know higher you know nasty fat foods I would kill my and blunt my appetite. Never remember I would had to eat 10 to 12 times a day If you're eating if you're eating junkier foods, you can't consume as much as you can if you're eating clean foods because clean foods go through faster And they process faster. So for me I looked forward to a weekend sheet meal because it was it was a you know I would eat yogurt or you know like those frozen yogurt So it should really ice cream essentially I would go and have oil you can eat you know buffet Since I'm in that show it was a name it enabled me to have like extra and I always did it the end of the day So I had already got all my good meals in now and then it was like icing on the cake For people who who who gain weight really easy and don't need a ton of food You probably don't need a specific specified sheet meal other than if you wanted to say hey It was one day where I'm eating what I want a lot of guys don't eat that clean in their off-season So for them It's irrelevant but the way I structure my diets and for my you know athletes that I work with it's pretty clean off-season eating and Then I give them that sheet meal so they can kind of go nuts one day a week and I don't mind because it doesn't matter It's only one meal Let's go to the Instagram questions again if you're not following us already it's underscore or Ex-Muscle official underscore or Ex-Muscle day the first three questions that kind of sandwich together So they all have to do with carbs So I don't know if you want to ask them all rat that fire and you want to take your time answering them or you want to go to an Individual league. Let's see let me hear what you grab the fire. So one is your take on front carb loading The other one is can you carb load on BCA's two when I answer those two first? I don't know what would carb loading on BCA's really is you're not gonna not kind of really Stored like a chin-y taking in branch Shane amino acids. I mean So you really I mean I guess they're referring to the fact that maybe mixing carbs with branch Shane amino acids Opposed the eating with like a protein source you always want to eat carbs with protein You never want to just eat them alone. I'll tell you why because protein buffers the insulin response Okay, what it means is it slows down how fast the food is absorbed Okay, and it prevents you from overreleasing insulin because when you eat pure carbs You release your body just goes crazy and releases too much insulin usually so Protein kind of balances that a little bit so and also when you got to remember a lot of people think Oh, I'm carbing up the last couple days. I don't really need to eat any protein You're dumbies just still eat you still repairing muscle You know, you know unless you took three weeks off from the gym, you know before you show you're you know Just because you have been trained in a day or so it doesn't mean you're not repairing muscle It takes probably two weeks before you bite it repairs all the muscle from your last workout you did Likewise as I mentioned earlier you're still Replacing you know the internal lining of your intestinal track your skin cells your hair nails That's that's a protein requirement So you don't want to start cannibalizing Skellable muscle which is the expendable muscle source Okay, while you're carb loading because you're gonna you're gonna start flattening at and not looking as good So I don't I very rarely reduce the only time I reduce protein is that last the day of the contest Because on the day of the contest you don't need to eat a ton of protein So if a person's eating eight or seven or eight ounces of protein per meal I might have me for four and a half ounces of protein per meal with their 50 60 whatever 70 grams of carbs per meal Only on showday because on showday you're really not drinking anything So you really don't want to be taking the tonic protein, but you do want to have some so it balances that insulin response Now I just wanted to just throw a plug in here for my good friend Heinz senior who sent me these great are a Tumosal masks that are adjustable So if you guys are looking for a adjustable mask I don't even know where he's selling him I got I gotta find out, but see they got this little like dry string I was showing him my after I was there that it's the only mask that fits me because I could actually adjust how how why they are August and they don't because the ones that they sell in the store They're usually too tight at the big head and they are they're always pulling my ears back like this and so These are great. They have the repeater one. We have the one with a little logo in here I got to get to see I got to get some of these for you so you can wear them through your nails and gigs Yeah, no one Just coverage otherwise I'll be wearing the hospital one. Let's go I'm gonna throw in a third one here It's from Ivan body building Do you think insulin would help at all when carbing up for a show if you're not consuming a crazy amount of carbs? I don't think it's necessary now now you could tell if it's necessary very easily By testing your blood sugars, okay if you're carving up and your your blood sugars are running high Meaning you're not absorbing your carbs properly because for whatever reason your insulin's not working You don't have you don't produce up insulin or because of the GH you're taking the insulin's not working Or because of the clumbutor all you're taking it's raising your blood sugar because you know Clumbutor all can raise blood sugar by and by causing glucogun production Very simple like I said as your carving up you test your blood sugar if it's if it's running high It like two hours after your meals if you're running over one 30 or your fastings in the morning or over 90 You might want to take a little fast acting insulin with your meals while you're carving up, but I don't but in my experience most people don't need that Let's go to Samurai 84 thoughts on a young guys in the industry opting it to be on TRT Does Uranus are cycling by young men early 20s? Yeah, I think it's stupid. I don't I don't think staying on HRT is is necessarily Bad for your health toxicity wise because I mean, let's face it an HRT dose is It's gonna do nothing. I think what the problem is Is that you're not allowing your receptors to resensitize themselves because here you are you're on the high dose You go down to TRT dosages, but you're still like taking in the exogenous source of testosterone and you're You're maintaining your your levels at a high or maybe slightly higher than high normal Value your receptors really are still overstimulated So they're not gonna they'll improve somewhat your engine and receptors, but they're not gonna go back to baseline normal If you go off and you go low because what happens? Look at when you go off a side like you can take all the HDG and one you're still gonna be low testosterone Okay, that's good for a few weeks it four weeks of being low is not gonna it is not gonna end in a world You won't even realize it probably But what it's doing is it's resensitizing the receptors because the body doesn't know it doesn't have enough testosterone The engine receptors think that this is not enough and the engine receptors pro president So they increase their numbers and that's the advantage of going completely off every year and I guess that I've told the story before One year out of my entire career. I didn't go off. I stayed on like an HRD pet like five million ribs a week I felt like that It was in 2000 1997 I just placed fourth and 96 nationals behind Warville Burke Tom Prince and Jay-Totler I probably should have been hired I year but whatever for whatever reason this I was happy was my first placing in a national a pro qual file show I was over like excited about the whole thing I stayed on the whole year. I had a lot of guest posing. I should have gone off like I did every year I didn't have to national's like stayed on and in 97 I I placed fifth of the nationals And you know what I my body looked tired even to myself and and one of the judges told me that Of course, I was insulted when he told me that but I looked at the pictures after what I said You know what he's right. I didn't I wasn't sharp something like I didn't improve It was the only year I hadn't really made improvements I did my body weight went up a little bit like five or six pounds But but I I wasn't a better look for some reason and that upset me and I realized you know what I got to clean out and I went off like 12 or 14 weeks after that That nationals in 97 and I looked I thought I looked and felt way better the following year so Whatever it's worth Sorry, I'll just go to JD J bear Shockey your take on doing standing calf raises one leg at a time By feeling is that it allows for a greater mind muscle connection Obviously the weight will have to be reduced because you won't let it at a time Would love your opinion our thoughts and for the more is that something that you tried during your bodybuilding career I'll you can't do standing calf raises one leg at a time because it's impossible to balance the weight would happen to you greatly reduce But what you can do when and what I used to do sometimes is every like maybe other work out I would go on a leg press machine You know they had that little pad that extends and I put my foot and I would do one leg is on there with lighter weight of course Because now I don't the balance myself I'm kind of laying in a comfortable position and I can do my one one leg at a time And this way I would make sure that both gas truck nameiest muscles on the right and the left leg We're getting equal work and if one was a little behind the other one I would do a little few extra sets Excuse me a few extra reps for that the weaker or smaller calf and I felt that kelp kept the balance really well However as my career progressed and my calves kind of came up and they were they looked pretty good I was able to kind of balance it just doing standing calf raises with ball plagues I kind of knew which leg was was the weaker one So I would kind of favor that one when I would do the two leg it and I and I kept my legs pretty much in good balance But initially when I had the little bit of an imbalance that's what I would do Don't try to do a standing calf with the butt with the with the pad on top of you standing one like at a time You'll never balance your wine of twisting your ankle or something like that It's not worth the aggravation and the impossible injury Yeah, so that is second question as well You're take on assisted pull-up machines that a lot of gyms have I've been incorporating into my back training rather than regular pull-ups And I feel it allows me to really focus on hitting the last back muscles and getting a great overall Contraction I like the assistant it's kind of like you kneel on the pad and it kind of like you can set a weight stack I've of how much assistance is giving you as you're doing those pull-ups and I used to you know when I hit a certain weight I don't know if it was about 280 or something to seven when I hit a show I couldn't pull my body up my body weight in many more it was just I was too heavy And my most of my weight was in my legs so it was like dead weight hanging there So when I would do what I would do is I would usually every other back work I would do the assisted pull-up machine. I still think pull-ups are the best that I fact I said Which is the problem is when you get very heavy it's hard to pull your body weight up and I'm a guy who is a stick Well, I would get my my verse of grippers on there and I would literally pull up with till my chest hit the bar I mean that I believe in full range of motion and it's very hard to do that when you weigh you know 300 pounds So by standing you know kneeling in that little pad and giving you that assistance You can count a balance today as much as you want depending on how much you put on that weight stack It definitely gives you the ability to still do pull-ups without having to worry about you're being too heavy It was good a John Patty current Dave the maximum amount of scoops of way You should put in a shake without it being a waste of protein I've used up to six scoops in the path before bed To try and curb hungering side of so I might sweet tooth. I'm a bit concerned that a some of the protein will not be utilized and b It may be stressing out my digestive system. Yeah People who tend to do too many scoops like I do a kid or you was doing like a hundred grams of way protein like four or five times a day That's a lot of protein They their breath would stink of and it wasn't their breath really it was an internal body odor They were just reeking ammonia And that's just because the kidneys and the liver couldn't deaminate all that they were overeating protein That means if you're if you got an ammonia breath coming out of your body You're probably eating too much protein or something toxic is going on in your body so you know 60 maybe 70 grams of the most of protein per meal is probably Nax what I would do I think 60 grams of way I so like if you did two scoops of ice-sized Which is about it comes out to you about 55 grams of protein that's ideal You don't really need to go much higher than that. I'd rather you do more frequent meals or shakes Then try to jam more into each Because remember you can only utilize so much per meal in other words and and it's really dependent on how big you are So if I'm 300 pounds Let's say I could assimilate 60 grams of protein obviously I'm gonna be able to assimilate more than say a person who's 180 pounds would Because I have more muscle mass. Let's say 60 grams is perfect for me But I have a very fast metabolism and I might even tabilizes this stuff as soon as it hits my bloodstream So instead of doing a 120 grams of protein, you know six times a day I'll do 60 but I'll spread it out you know over 12 meals. That's why that's why I was eating so many times a day because I didn't want a jam at all into one big meal because I knew the body couldn't utilize in all at once So I kind of experimented and so how much my body can handle which for me was about 60 to 70 most grams of protein per meal I would never go over that and Especially with shakes because shakes get absorbed so quickly. Only one shot if you eat a steak that 70 grams of protein It's gonna take eight hours to absorb that whole steak okay, the way you're because the digestion is so slow But way goes right in so if you're infusing that much protein into the bloodstream that quickly Your body has to break something that down and get rid of it and that's just a waste It's a waste number one of money But it's also a waste because it's causing your body to have to work hard it to break down the stuff when it doesn't need all that protein It's gonna jam it and mills with a reclassification of Hc G by the FDA for TRT HRT related purposes What are your thoughts on clinics prescribing and forgive me if I get it strong gonna derail in as a substitute? I know that most compounding pharmacies don't want to pay for the new licenses of course, but is this going to have much of an effect on TRT HRT effects efficacy you know, TRT is really Predicated on a replacement dose of testosterone So the the an-an-fate shot you take on the test sipping a shot you think that's really what's giving you the bang It's the Hc is kind of just Stimulating the testicles Hc G is more of a post cycle or if your body you for some reason you want to turn your body back on Because you want to try to get your wife pregnant or something like that It's really not necessary to be honest with you, you know Really honest I don't think I took an ACGG I only took an HcG shot once a year Because that's when I would go off so I would do cycle the whole year, you know Offseason into pre-contest after the show is over. I did my HcG for two weeks literally that was it and then I went and then I Stayed off for six or eight weeks, you know, and then I went back and then again I never took HcG off if there's no reason to it's like literally going to the beach To enjoy the sand and bringing like a little a ziplock bag of sand with you and saying Look, let's throw this on the beach. We're gonna have a lot more sand now You're not gonna even know it's there you're basically wasting you should Might just keep the sand at home because you're wasting it because it's you're not Gonna even know it's there. It's not doing anything in relation to what you're taking already because you're taking so much more injectable Testosterone that that little bit of HcG that's gonna cause you to produce a little bit of natural testosterone is not doing anything Okay now Have you said that if you're on an HRT dose to testosterone, which is a hundred maybe 200 milligrams a week max And you know It's not gonna be a super super high amount and you want to take a little HcG with that to keep your testicles working Just to feel good because maybe the the the TRT dose is not giving you enough in terms of sex driving crease That's fine, but on cycle it doesn't even pay to take HcG while you're on the cycle Let's go to mod soloski Lucas low IGF1 level despite high GH level on blood test farm at GH Should you pay attention to it apparently level of IGF in the blood if not reliable? And we should be interested in the level of IGF in the muscle and that can only be checked with a biopsy your thoughts Girl hormone injections don't cause increases in IGF Basically local muscle IGF There's two types of IGF there's the IGF that's systemically produced and that's from the liver Essentially you're you take a GH shot of your body releases growth hormone It goes to the liver it tells the liver basically produced IGF1 Okay, that's why it used to be called so mademeed in C because median mean in the middle So you'd have the GH at the top Sumatem mean into the middle and then and then the the the growth effect from it is what you get Okay, so and then they change the name from some out of the insane to IGF1, but because it had an insulin like effect on the body But that's the systemic effect now when the your body systemically releases IGF1 in Relation to growth hormone injection or release It will find the target issues that have been damaged so if you break down your biceps from doing a bicep routine They'll cause Local production of IGF1 receptors that systemic IGF1 will locate those receptors and bind to them and help prepare Okay, they'll muscle there that that that we know But also there's a local production of IGF1 so when that when the muscle cells are mechanically disturbed Because you're in the gym and you're training right and they're broken apart at the mechanic of this disturbance You release something known as a mokmocanograph factor Mgf It's really just local produced IGF1 it's the same hormone, but it's being trickled out locally From the tissues as their damage and mechanically disturbed and that helps with local recovery right there So you don't you don't have to depend on this on systemic taking gh doesn't affect that that local production of IGF1 Now there was a this this you go to these peptide sites and you can buy a mokanograph factor Ngf and a lot of people thought well if I take an angel and I'll get local growth Not really because what's happening is you inject it into the muscle of your arm your bicep and then it's in the bloodstream And 30 seconds and it doesn't stay there But when your body is trickling it out in that area in relation to like I said a mechanical disturbance down there That's why you're getting some growth from it because it's being trickled out constantly in in this area You can't really duplicate that by injection Okay, now if you're taking growth home and you go to get your your labs checked and your and IGF1 levels are not elevated There's a number of reasons, you know assuming the gh is real it could just be that you're about you have it delayed response to it You might have already released your you know IGF gets elevated, but it doesn't stay elevated very long So you might have missed the perfect window of when it went up So that's why that that whole test of a I'll take a shot of GH go to the doctor two hours later Get a blood work and I'll see what my IGF1 levels it doesn't always work that way That's just not the way our bite. We're not we're not robots. Okay unfortunately That's why the right test kit that I sell for testing GH at daypaloma.com is so important because it's like It's almost like a pregnancy test you dip the stick in for 20 seconds you put it on the table you leave it after 20 minutes If you got two lines it's fake if you got one line It's real it's that easy and and everyone who uses GH should test because I hate them I keep reporting worse than worse statistics, but it's true I would say 75% of the GH out there is nothing zero has nothing in it And the other 25% you know seems to be good how what's the dosage? We don't really know now what's as far as anabolic skill for my experience over the last You know a couple years with his right test kits. I'm seeing that a lot of the anobox The last six months have been coming back as test propina Meaning that if it's an injectable rather than putting decker rather than putting test an antfait rather than putting Master on and they're putting test propinaated there because it's cheap and Most of the orals I'm seeing tested the anobars and the winchials which a lot of women are using They're coming back as diannable method and just stand alone Probably at least 70% of the time so you have to test your gear you've got to go to go to my website You got to buy these these it's part of your regiment if you're gonna buy the steroids in the GH by the test kits At least you'll know if they're good or not and the great thing is the new test kits are quantitative or Senate 70 quantitative Mean that you can see what the dosages on test test Test an antfait test sipping a deck at And try an anthe you can actually determine what the range of dosages in there It's a separate test it's called the 20 quantitative test you buy that and you could test your your gear Not only for if it's real, but if it's how much is in there if you buy the complete testing system Everything's in that kit you know you just might have to buy some refills depending on how much you're testing But everything is in the kit so Yeah, it's it's bad news, but it's good news is bad news because it's unfortunate that there's a lot of unscrupulous It's kind of that's a word there are a lot of people that have no scruples about them And they'll they'll sell you anything the good thing is that we have testing kits to verify if this stuff is good Time only for a couple more questions. I'll just go to Ben barnbell at Nutrition. Do you think someone really needs to go all in on Balking or trying to lean out or is there a middle at ground approach to be hadn't gaining muscle and staying only Look, you know depends what your goals are I was an extremist when I was growing I wanted to grow as much muscle as possible when I would lean out I want to get as ripped as possible. I don't like this like well I'm happy with the balance in my life. I wasn't balanced. I wanted to be extreme So for me There's no casual diet and there's no casual bulk up. It doesn't work you get no results You gain two pounds or lose two pounds and that's not acceptable to me So when I did something I did it at a hundred percent Now that's not to say that I'm not going to if I'm walking up I'm not going to eat Way more food than I need and you can turn to a fat slob just the game way It means I'm going to specifically target my diet so that I know that I can maximize gains and recovery Okay, and not worry necessarily that getting bloated or not necessarily worry About hey, oh I have to stuff eight meals or 10 meals down my throat every day. It's too much I don't want to be bothered I'm I've bloated I didn't make those excuses I said hey this is what I want to look like and I know what I get to do to look like that so I'm not going to make excuses If I feel like I'm going to throw up half the day because I hate eating all that food so be it. I'm getting that food down Let's go to Shawnee boy fit Dave. How do you feel you would have compete done competing in this era? Do you think you would have gone pro easier? Relatively speaking and do you think you would have made it to the Olympia stage? What if anything knowing you know now? Would you have done differently again? I just competed today I think I definitely would have been pro because I think it would have been easier for me to turn pro There was more opportunity you know Think about I play second twice at the national level show. I mean now they're giving pro cards for top two It national so I definitely would have turned pro How I would have done is the pro. I don't think I would have made it for the Olympia stage Unless I had a show I got really lucky and one because I was the only guy there that was like shredded and big You know because there were guys the just the structures on the even today These guys have this beautiful structures. I can't see winning a pro show today You know back in the day you place top three you made it to the Olympia You know that's not the case today. So I don't think I would have made it through the Olympia stage I probably would have placed top five maybe a couple pro shows I definitely would have gotten a pro card like that's it just because I think it was bit would have been easier And I probably would have made a lot of money because you know They didn't have social media when I was competing so you know people like to see big freaky guys If I would have documented what I was doing and eating I think people would have found that entertaining You know I would have been doing what I'm doing now just would have been in a different perspective would have been more in relation to me Rather than in relation to what everyone else is doing. You know Last question now you're gonna have to tell the story a little bit to breakfast Who would win in a fight you or your dentist? It's a good question. I don't know When I get angry you know You know the old saying you've seen my routine you wouldn't like me when I'm angry you know I turn it to the Hulk You don't want to make me turn it to the Hulk and I don't like to turn it to the Hulk because I'm a mild man or you know reporter You know from the metropalten newspaper, but When I lose my cool I could be pretty dangerous so You know you screw around with me with my mouth guard, you know three times the succession and you know You're done so I think I would take the dentist out. Yeah. He's a little on the skinny side But he is a little younger than me, but you know when I hit him with the Hulk smash that's it it's over We had to get this one last one in from a surge body dead. Is there anyone in body building that you haven't met before But you wish you had the chance to meet them in person It's good because it's a congression Yeah, I've never had I never had a sit down with Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't know why I I've a cost at him at a buffet once before at Whole famed ceremony and asked him about the meat bully bus eating, but I I don't know why I just never got a chance to interview and really sit down even talk with him I've shook his hands before he's come by by booth before and and we've said hello politely But you know, I've never really had a chance to sit down and talk shop I would love to hear some of the Arnold stories and just sit down and get him in a relax even if it wasn't an Interview for like a like a for for Channel or anything like just to shoot the crap with Arnold you know that that would I think though I think that would be interesting. I'd like to know like you know what he's like, you know Just just hanging out because I heard he's very funny and I already is really cool You know when he hangs out with all his buddies, you know that you know he grew up with you know all the body bulls He'll make like Ralph Mueller hit like most must-see-l-shots and you know He'll tell Fred used to tell Frank a wolf and time to hit poses, you know and you know they would have fun So I I know Arnold got a good sense of humor like that, you know, I'm kind of like that too He's sarcastic he doesn't make himself that seriously So I guess it would be Arnold you know that was really you know Lufra Ignel was my other guy. I really looked up to coming up and dory into so those guys I kind of am friends with so I I can't you know that kind of check that box off But Arnold was always that like a loose of you know because I kind of got into the sport when he was like almost too popular so to speak and I couldn't get close enough to him in that sense and So I guess it would be Arnold because he's kind of like an an enigma for me because I don't really know him on a personal level And that's gonna do for this episode of as Dave Reminder tomorrow episode the interview with Ian Valley a going up tomorrow afternoon Stay around two clock Easter center time on our smustle.com and the our exp muscle youtube channel Of course if you have not yet already subscribed hit the subscribe button below hit the notification button Not gonna miss any of our upcoming segments or any of our content and of course if you like which you're watching hit the like button Comment below appreciate your support as always for Dave plumbo and Tyler sure.
