This is Trevor Gritz and I'm here with I-FB Pro call it Nelson for the second part of our insulin explosive videos series. So in part one we discussed that if you're over a hundred fasting blood glucose, you're going to want to take some mitigation strategies. So the first thing we recommended is you know, try just prioritizing your carbs around your workout, minimize stimulants, try to minimize stress, improve sleep. Luckily if you're a young guy who hasn't been abusing carbs stimulants too long, you'll most likely be able to get your fasted blood glucose under a hundred just by doing some lifestyle changes. However if you make the necessary lifestyle changes you're being smart with your diet if you're being cognizant of your stimulant usage or stress and your fasting blood glucose numbers are still high we recommend getting further blood work testing. So that's where first going to do we're going to talk about what to get tests in the blood work and what all those numbers mean. So the first thing you should get tested is insulin levels. So call that talk just about what exactly that is and what numbers you would want to see. So you're looking at how much insulin in your body is putting out. So those normally range in the United States between two and about one thing right? So in somebody that has this predisposition of this prediabetes you might see those levels high because the body is working too hard because the cells are resistant. So that's a common denominator which sounds counterintuitive. Now if you do see that the insulin levels are really low you could be on your way to type one diabetes. Type two diabetes starts with higher than normal in some levels. Just make sure that's clear and that's the reason why is because the body is working too hard and it's trying to keep the blood sugar down and it can. Okay so the second thing you should be tested for is you should get tested is C peptide. So call that charges with C peptide. C peptide is very important. That is showing the body's ability, the endogenous insulin production. Okay so those two tests kind of correlate some extent. So for example I have no C peptide. Okay so C peptide is usually between 0.8 and 3.85. So minus less than 0.1 sorry for me okay I don't make any insulin. So when you see the C peptide low this can be confusing on some levels too. If you see the C peptide low then the body is not naked much in insulin okay so if the C peptide is in normal range then your body is still producing insulin and you're in a good place. You're in the place where that you know if you're fasting sugar is a running higher and you're making a good C peptide you got hold your beta is still functioning it's looking good. When you got to get concerned is when that C peptide starts to get lower. So if you have a low C peptide and very high in some levels eventually what will happen is you'll have a low C peptide that's not going to change but the insulin levels are going to come down where you don't make any more in some. So the third thing you're wanting to get tested is your hemoglobin A1C so call it tartus above that. So the hemoglobin A1C is if we find one of the gold standards I mean actually used this two diagnosed so this is very important and this is one that you really want to listen to. Pre diabetes is a hemoglobin A1C and what is looking at is the life of the red blood cell. The red blood cell lists for 120 days so what they do is they take a hemoglobin red blood cell A1C and they're looking at how much glucose has collected on top of the red blood cell so it's it's telling a huge story okay 5.7 to 6.4 is pre diabetes again 5.7 to 6.4 we're diagnosing it so if you come up with a 5.6 I'm worried I'm like a person that's like okay red blood okay so that means you're in a situation where the beta cell is starting to fit. Once you get to 6.5 the beta cell usually is only functioning at 50%. So then if you're the higher the A1C the more risk for micro and macro complicated that's a best-ular complication so there's a big A1C scale that will put up so that you'll see what I made because each of these numbers equate to a three-month average so for example if your A1C is a five year average glucose is about 90 for 90 days which is excellent okay so I would want to have an A1C of 5 I have a 5.3 by the way so I'm not doing too bad but and I'm a type one but yes so that's really important is to check that A1C it is a diagnostic criteria now so it's important and then there's also some specific type one diabetes tests you are getting to answer if your type one diabetic you'd also want to get these tested the first one is the dad 65 antibody right so these are this is what happens in type one diabetes it isn't auto immune disease and it happens at any age that's why we don't call it juvenile diabetes anymore if you have type one in your family and I say that because my body was type one and there is this kind of broadest area component but then I find that people what the hell auto big at that type one diabetes that crazy world of we live in now we're seeing it actually increase in type one diabetes and then we find that 30% of our type two's are actually type ones and we call it type one and a half so if you have any concern and you're on the younger side and you're just after everything you're doing you're doing the things that you're trying to get that fast and sure to down yet it's not happening and you're just something's wrong you know you're getting this kind of the symptoms of diabetes which is extreme thirst, excessive eating and losing weight and losing muscle you're basically body sitting itself okay that's when you want to get these dad antibodies it's again 65 antibody that's the particular antibody that starts attacking the beta stuff and if that's high so for example mine is actually I'm looking at my lab work it's one end up mine's in let's see mine's our 72 they should be less than five guess what I'm a type one there's no question so anything over five okay is it concerned mine's 72 so my antibodies are absolutely firing and attacking my beta cell every single day god help us find a cure for auto databases but that's one you want to test for type one so the second type one diabetic specific blood work bio marker you'd want to test for is your isolate cell antibody screen yes so that one mine for example is 2.9 it should be less than 0.8 so I am testing positive for yet another the isolate cell you guys isolate cells a later hand of the beta cell that's making my insulin so I'm having it come from different angles there are actually people that have different types of type one diabetes that don't actually have the organic antibodies what they have these isolate cell antibodies so either way they're not producing the right amount of insulin to maintain their blood sugar levels me unfortunately I have different antibodies firing so I have in I've a worst case scenario so I don't have any info production some production is better than that so the last type one specific blood work bio marker you want to test for is your isolate i8 to antibody screen so it's interesting I'm actually in the right range for this mine's not high so I guess that's a positive but the other cure cells try I'm gonna I'm not doing so well because I'm not making an insulin but it should be less than 0.4 and mine actually is so I've never tested positive for this particular antibody so if you have all three I guess I would say that you're at a worst stage in auto antibody hormones but that might be another reason why I I most type ones and autoimmune disease is like to come in three so I never have celiac I didn't get how she motors even how she motors is a thyroid condition the thyroid antibodies are attacking the thyroid so I'm lucky in that nature so those are the three though in particular that you want to have looked at if you have any concern that this might be more sinister than just some auto regulation of your blood sugar so now we're going to get into all the different types of insulin so call it as an talk about the half life and when you want to take it so the first thing I'm going to talk about is hemologue. So this is the try to true and I think everybody knows hemologue right I mean hemologue you guys these come in pens now this is kind of the preferred way of giving insulin I think is it's just easier they come in these little pen devices and then you just put out a pen needle right here on the top and that you change every day and many times you take it as fun so hemologue now all these insulin like to come concentrated you'll notice that they come in you 100 and you 200 but just concentrated and does demand action so you don't want to pull it out from a syringe anymore because sometimes these insulin are concentrated we'll talk about we'll talk about that when we get into some of the basal insulin um hemologues these when we talk about these rapid acting phones are all very very similar in their action of onset and I want to almost put them not to talk over your children and the long-winded but this one is one of the faster of your rapid acting insulin it starts in about 10 to 15 minutes it peaks in about 60 to 90 minutes and then it's out of the body and about 45 hours so you're really looking at that peak action in the first 90 minutes. Do you want hemologue is the one that everyone's using pre-workout and then taking all the intricate cards and essentially yes that's I would say not very many diet bed XR using hemologue but it's all the bodybuilders do these pre-workout case the next one we're going to talk about is a pedra right so a p-drop p-drop is an interesting this is kind of with the Sanofi's second launch to Lantis which is interesting because they have one of the best top-selling basal insulin on the market they couldn't get this one any market action really this doesn't have a lot of so p-drop actually is a faster so really goes in line of a fast action this is actually a little bit faster than hemologue this one has a start time about five to ten minutes and peaking in about 16 to 90 again and out of the body in about four hours so this one is a little bit more rapid I take and this one this is my far-fast as long and what we're trying to do by speed is just mimicking physiology a little bit better by the speed and action of the insulin so there's a p-drop so that two more to go through the next one is going to be novolog so good old novolog okay a lot of people take novolog because novolog is the novonortist version of um hemologue but in an action time you really go a p-drop hemologue and novolog novolog really starts in almost 15 to 20 minutes and it peaked again in about 90 minutes and it's a little bit it has a little bit of a longer tail okay so it's still a rapid action insulin but it's the slowest of the rapid um again still a premium insulin still one that many people use in the body of the world and obviously what a type one would use in for meal time itself and now finally the new kid to the block of present I know this is the one called as super excited about yeah this is before we talk about a fresco though there's bias which came out in response to almost the rapidity of a fresco bias came out Canada first trailer this was uh and everybody in the US was trying to get their hands on it bias starts in two and a half minutes you guys so it's in the body extremely quick okay there's no 10 to 15 minutes waiting I mean 20 and a half minutes and the peaked time in about 60 minutes and it's out of the body about four hours okay so finally you have kind of be what's considered a fresco which is actually the most bio identical of all the rapid action insulin so when you think about injecting insulin you guys it's in a hexomere it's in several molecules and those molecules have to be injected into the substitute which is your fat tissue and has to get into the peripheral there's a keyword peripheral bloodstream right it never really goes to the portal circulation which is the liver and remember when we talked about the liver in the first series the liver is constantly pushing out glucose so this is why Ali Ali I mean I have to get a credit on this one he did a whole thing on on a frozen because he feels that this could be a very landmark rapid action insulin so what you're doing is you're actually putting in a cartridge of insulin on units okay it comes in four eight and 12 units and these little cartridges go inside this little device and then all you're doing is and that's how you take your insulin and now not only is it not an injection it's very convenient it's actually shutting off the alpha cell which makes scoooka down so there's less fat gain within a fresco then there would be with an injected insulin just by the nature of delivery and it's being more bio-identical to the body it's in the body in less than one minute it peaks in 45 minutes and it completely clears from the body in 90 minutes clear it's gone in a four unit cartridge and in a 48 units the 48 units it doesn't last any longer than three hours so you're reducing the risk of hyperboicemia could be it's this is no one's even talking about this I mean is I am I'm using it that's that's the insulin I don't use I don't use injected insulin this is by far the most unique delivery system and probably the best way to deliver insulin just by nature of the way the lungs absorbs it and the blood vessel and how much fat scalary there is in the lungs to the body well pretending that a menolide in a retocobota you guys heard it here for a super say to be delivering this groundbreaking information for you guys now charge us with the basal insulin before you get into all the different types talk about the difference between basal insulin and all the different forms of insulin you just spoke about so what we just spoke about you guys was a rapid acting meal time insulin so in a person with type one diabetes they can't control their insulin and basal alone because a basal insulin is just a flat insulin that sits in the background for 24 hours everybody makes insulin every hour everybody you need insulin every single minute every second of your life but when you eat you need what a call of bolus of insulin these are all bolus insulin do you eat a particular output of insulin for every single thing you eat everything everything so that even includes fats and proteins if people don't oftentimes think about so it's not just your cars protein can convert to glucose and even your fat can be delivered to boost glycerone at some level they raise your total daily dose of insulin so those are all your rapid acting insulin necessary to control glucose meals basal insulin is extremely important to fix the fasting blood sugar and to give you back that homeostasis and in my theories if you can give a basal insulin again it just brings your bottom what your baseline blood sugar down a little bit and gives the blood the pateous cell a little bit of rest because it's working for 24 hours day give it a break and it's giving it a break by giving it a basal nasal insulin so now talk to us about the different types of basal insulin and half life's peak times things like that so let's start with you know everybody is talking about lances like lances was the number one was not anymore was the number one basal insulin on the market and this can't to market around 1999 2000 okay so this is this rubble in chenized revolutionized type 2 diabetes and it's going to continue to revolutionize as back then they started to realize how you can get insulin to tight teeth they actually thought that you couldn't get insulin to type 2 diabetes now think about where we are now it's like they're giving in to all of them because there's no other way to control their beta cell because their beta cell failed because they were so silly to think that these people could just survive on pills that weren't controlling the blood sugar and they didn't realize that now today's world is beta cell preservation ask any top end odor like we got to preserve the beta cell and how do we do that insulin actually that's how we do that so lances is the tried insurer rantus unfortunately I'm going to tell you guys the truth about lances they say the 24 hour insulin but we know better now the they didn't really change the package insert but it actually starts in about one hour and then it doesn't have a peak but people that know lances and the type one world will know that I'm listening to me you won't notice this of your type 2 you won't notice this even if your body going to take you in but it has a bit of a peak at about six to eight hours it's flat but it about six hours it comes up a little bit and then it comes back down and then it's out of the body and about 16 to 18 hours so I have been one to usually split that and I see a better just the way it stacks on each other gives you a better a few a ladder profile and that's what you want more flat and forget about so it's been you know historically given once a day lances but if you think about it it doesn't really last that full 24 hours as long as you see do you want to talk with any other base of funds or insulin or do you think what I think that lances now has been replaced like no one orders came up with 11 air and 11 air ball short it's about 14 to 16 hour insulin starts in about one to two hours and again that does have a peak and that is suggested to split twice a day so if you're using 11 air out there you should split that in front then after that they realize that we need a 24 hour insulin so fantasy came up with a genius idea of concentrating lances they took lances and they squeezed the molecule they made it smaller so if the depot a depot is like how much you inject this is if this is lances this little circle this is to jail if much less liquid then concentrated to you 300 so one unit on a U 100 syringe is actually three units they basically and they concentrate at the end so let me keep it simple by concentrating and you're injecting less liquid in your body and it dissipates over 36 hours so now we know that we had the drawbacks of lances now to jayoh came out to jayoh is a 36 hour insulin sits much flatter and it's giving you about that 24 hour profile so to jayoh was kind of like wow now we finally sitting with a more predictable basal insulin I like that one much better than lances and much better than 11 air then what I consider basically one of the most innovative basal insulin by novernortis was tristiva and tristiva took what to jayoh did used it in a U 100 or U 200 which is just a concentration and gave you 42 hours so that doesn't mean you don't sit every other day I mean they tried to do that and they realized we're gonna get this crazy much just the dose is a little bit interesting it's so flat that by stacking it you suit every day once the day 42 hours and by the way that it's stacked by the fifth day you reach steady state and it really has in terms of flat predictability and very low risk of hyperbois senior it has a great profile when you take it so we talk with the takeday basal insulin so same time every day you don't have to with tristiva you could be within an eight hour window so gives you a lot more flexibility and dosing a little bit more difficult to get on and one of the most expensive basal insulin so far away that one goes for like 800 dollars you know obviously I don't know what's going on in the black market but if you didn't have an inch if you didn't have prescription and here in the United States that's a very expensive insulin but by far one of the best and that is getting you that flamm on predictability okay call us let's wrap this up for all of our listeners so if someone is struggling with high-fast blood glucose levels they're not type one diabetic but they're borderline type two what basal insulin would you recommend that they start with and what doses would you recommend that they start with and then also when should they take it right so the basal insulin markets tricky I mean it's listen most people want to get what they want to get and depending on what your insurance is or what you can get your hands on what have you you got to consider basal insulin basal insulin okay so when you break it down we have all these little different nuances of each one which ones my favorite I feel like Tristiva to me is just in terms of risk of hyperbois senior and predictability the best I'm giving you a true 24 hour coverage to the Tujello nest in line been lantess in Leavener and then the final one is the generic basal but get your hands on basal insulin let's try to fix the fasting to ideal your vouchers are struggling you're not able to get it under 126 we need to do something you've tried everything and it's still not working so we want to fix the fasting first so if you're young and that basal hasn't been exposed to all the damage that we speak about that's I see in this industry then I think like you said Trevor let's that's act conservative in the medical profession we look at somebody that's fasting blood sugars are elevated and we start with point two units for kilogram body that might be too much you know the idea is not to feel this stuff you know so if you're on the younger side like you're in your 30s and you're noticing and you've ruled out type one diabetes you're not type one and you're fasting sugars are elevated you know you're yet done a few things in my life that might have predisposed me to this you want to maybe start conservative that's point one unit for your best small amounts okay small amounts so when theologist make clear is that she said kilograms not pound you take your weight and pounds divided by 2.2 and then what I would say is like if you're a very young guy I mean your beta cell probably isn't totally burnt out as quite as tired I would take that number and times it by 0.1 or 0.2 and that would be the amount of units of insulin per day so let's just say we had a 190 pound 30 year old okay and giving him the starting dose I just want you guys to please hear me on this that 0.1 is 190 pounds that 0.1 units per kilogram it's 8.8 units of insulin so let's start with 8 units and I know that sounds so small but even in package inserts of lances when we first started lances this is going back 20 years ago we didn't know what we were doing it that's how you got you just set on a package insert just give 10 units that was that was the and they just said start with 10 and tie a trade up to get your fasting sugar where you needed to go so when I say 8 that's conservative but it's not far out of the realm of what we did when we didn't really understand weight based dosing so start small and then test your fasting sugar and do not make immediate changes it takes 3 to 4 days for you to get that stacking of the basal insulin to really see if it's working so don't say the next I'm going to go up and go take your time and go up by 1 to 2 units don't this is not a race okay this is not a race to get to point where you have hyperguys senior so it started eight that's for the 190 pound 30 year old just like you said just a little tired made us up get the fasting sugar down and then you just kind of that dos kind of works you know and then you're like okay I'm going to go up to units now 10 because it's not right needed to be you shouldn't have to go up that high you know you shouldn't and if you do then something else might be going on you don't need a lot I mean I know this you know for sure now that being said if you are a guy when you're 40s 45 I haven't somebody's coming to my mind right now 45 been you know you know kind of a couple rough patches gained a little weight then he's back I'm a you know this is the guy's been working on his whole life you know issues with the fasting blood sugar he needs a bit more so we started at point two units which is the clinical dosing guidelines for patients that have a hot control fast at sugars and then you move up all right and we're moving him up we would have up I mean he's now taking a bit more and yeah I was just gonna say this to the to the public I want you to be please I don't even like saying this stuff is I really have to be smart about what you're doing more is never never never better with insulin it's all about your sugar you know that's they're not trying to I don't know what you're trying to do you you don't want to have a board so you're gonna get a 50 pounds you don't know sugar 70 to 120 right you don't want to push it below 70 but the average dose of basal insulin for somebody with diabetes is about 38 units just just to give you guys if for somebody with diabetes so when you don't have diabetes I don't expect you to get that high but you may have diabetes you know I can't tell you how many times I see guys that you know are in that position where their baby cell is no longer functioning as well as a sugar and they need to replace what their baby cells not making at this point I think we've pretty much covered everything the last thing I just want to touch on is that the amount of insulin you're taking if you're type to diabetic or if you're bored or on type to diabetic is not going to be static and I've had really get success with people come they've got high-faccing blood glucose levels we started to make the lifestyle change we spoke about I get them on a load dose of basal insulin and over the course of months we're able to reduce their basal insulin to actually nothing and I really think what Colette said is dead on is that they basically came to me their pancreas was very very tired we're supplying a basal insulin to kind of give the pancreas a break we're being smarter with their diet smart with their lifestyle things like that and then basically the pancreas they're able to heal itself and then you know basically a year or two years down the road they don't need that insulin anymore so don't don't think like okay I did everything Trevor and Colette said my dosage is 15 units per day I'm going to take this every day for an early rest of my life no no no what I would say is you know every month maybe kind of reassess and try a lower dosage if you're at 15 maybe after a month try dropping them 12 maybe try dropping it down to 10 maybe try dropping down to 8 6 and then off so especially if you're type to diabetic especially if you're a younger guy you must like you will be able to recover your pancreas call that do anything else I just want a second once you just said because I have a friend of mine who did just what you just said we started a mine actually had his hands on he got love in there and he was did he did it for and he's like a lot who are believe this all right he just he doesn't I mean it's fast and sugar who he did it for three months about three months maybe two months and um perfect this is this fast and she was 86 85 74 I mean no and so nothing um so it's pretty incredible that this is push-pull idea so don't think forever what we're thinking is like you said beta self preservation give it a rest let that little guy take a second to regroup and get stronger so that it's able to take the load of the life that we live and then just be kind of set up the things that we're talking about I mean from hydration to sleep to what you're eating we're eating two e-cars and I like the idea of you know around your workouts you just do not need to overdose on carbohydrates that's not necessary um and what medications and what stimulants and what things you're putting in your body that are causing insulin resistance and just the idea of more is not better even in terms of working out like we've become addicted to it to the point where we are stressing our entire central nervous system over and over again and we're never getting ourselves a day off and believe me my last thing and I'm gonna tell you this I have to take insulin to workout fasting blood sugar 85 this morning okay I take insulin no food water episode of vinegar lemon no nothing and my sugar will go up a hundred points if I do not take some rapid acting insulin for the workout because I was doing bad I was doing deadlift these these exercises cause a spider flight in your body so this is happening to me I know it because I see it so I don't make insulin but it's happening to you guys too when you do these crazy heavy stress I'm not telling you not to do that but that's just what I'm saying is you do need to give yourself a day off you gotta be got to rest otherwise you're gonna end up in that adrenal fatigue fried up flight and that is affecting your data sales level. Call it I really appreciate you taking the time of your day to this video with me guys give call it a follow on Instagram follow up on social media let's she is a very very smart woman do not take this lately don't just think oh I'm a young guy it's not gonna affect my physique or anything like that high fasting blood glucose lovers are linked to inflammation and inflammation is linked to pretty much every single disease in the body whether it be cardiovascular disease cancer stroke you name it so this is something you guys really want to be doing not just to give you the best physique possible but so the best health possible so for Trevor Kurditsin and high baby pro call it Nelson this has been our insulin exposed video series thank you so much for watching
