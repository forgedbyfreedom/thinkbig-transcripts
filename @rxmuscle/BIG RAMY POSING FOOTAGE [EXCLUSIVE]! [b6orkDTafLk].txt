What's up, body building fans, Dave Pullembo with an RX muscle, news update, big rami update that is because Bader Badae has sent us some new posing footage of Big Rami less than eight weeks out now from this to Olympic competition I got to say. He's looking pretty damn impressive. Big, full and definitely the hardest we've seen. He might be hard to hear what's the deal in the last year. I'd be honest with you. I'd like the grainyness of his body and just thinking showing some good detail. He doesn't look overly big, meaning that you know they're not trying to keep him too big and too full, which is always a problem when you talk about weight loss. We get that side leg. He's got glute striations. He's got good grainyness there. Yes, some makes a little full at this point. But he probably might have eaten five meals already today for all we know. But I'd never seen rami with glutes this grainy looking at this, this many weeks out. Now obviously all this gunner's shit in the hand basket if they start feeding him too much. But I think he's definitely on track to be his best at this point. Like I said, this condition level is super impressive right now. You know, if you think about it, big rami may have the biggest glutes in body, but you know, think about it. I think besides them, I don't think I thought I had big glutes. This guy's got enormous glute muscles because his legs are just huge. And he has time to to peek his body. I think this is a great update from big rami. I think that Beta was proud to show this. Obviously no filters on this or anything like that. I think rami's on track to do some series damage to this Olympia. Great looked for rami and we'll keep you updated in the coming weeks as we get more and more updates from Beta himself. Day polimbo with an RX muscle quick news update.
