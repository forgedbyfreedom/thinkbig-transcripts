We've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show. This is our best place to be in LA. Alright, self-ish-mine on rxmuscle.com. This is ass-day better known as hashtag ass-dave. You're 30-minute question and answer show with Dave Palombo. All your questions as usual, diet, training, supplementation, I-B-B-B-B-B-B-Rose competitions. Whatever's on your mind, bodybuilding or beyond, it is all on the table. We're going to go right into the questions. We have a couple of big guests lined up over the course of the next 30-to-40 minutes. So we want to get as many questions as possible. Let's go first of the day with the Lumpo Experience app. Dave, when should I use your power building program and for how long, for those who have not yet tried out the day with the most experience, if you want to get them a little primer? Yeah, I created this app a couple of years ago for people who wanted to have like a continuing education type of situation where they're always learning and it's an ability to watch and read all my writings, see all my videos I've ever done. But then also have the ability to ask me questions unlimited, I answer it however, an unusual way. And for everyone sees everyone's questions and everyone's answers. And then I take the best questions and I do an ask Dave like video, like I do here, except it's exclusively for the app only and it's at a much higher level. The questions are really more complex and more interesting, I think. So if you're interested in that and then of course, we put up a workout every single week. So you can kind of change up your workouts if you want. It's a great resource to have it. You're back in call. Now the question was what again? No, the power listing. Oh, all right, the power, how long? Yeah. One of the workouts we put up there is my power phase routine, which is usually like a six to eight week program. Usually when guys are in the midst of an off season where they're trying to put on maximum size, it focuses more on the basic movements and it takes away a lot of the little accessory movements as I call them. It really heavily focused on the leg workout is 10 sets of squats essentially with a couple little other stuff and they have it not much more. Benching on chest aches a lot of incline benching, bent rows on dead lifts on back day. It's really focused on the power compound movements so you can build not only strength, but mass and not worry about having to do all the other stuff because when all the other stuff takes away energy from the stuff that you should be focusing on predominantly. So this is a really good building phase. I usually like I said recommend usually eight weeks is the most you can do it because it's very traumatizing to your nervous system to have to have that kind of heavy weight with that kind of intensity. So don't do it for too long or you're going to get stalemate and once again, I try to have guys do it when they're in the midst of their maximum eating and maximum if they're using the maximum gear cycle as well. It's a lot more of that. We're going to be bringing back iron debate. We'll do that live as well. We like these interactions with you. The Rx muscle community beat on Instagram, beat on YouTube or be on YouTube live. So we look forward to doing that a lot more. Let's go to Actar, McShafftar, do all pros, good one here. Do all pros need gynaus surgery at some point should you budget for gynaus surgery when using gynaus. It's like asking to all figure and bikini and women's physique pros need breast enhancement surgery and most of them do and most guys are going to need to have gynaus surgery if you want to have a nice peck line there. There are some not many but there are some people that just don't have breast tissue down there. They don't have the glands in there. It's like some women just have small boobs. They never have any tissue there just genetically that's the way they are. The majority of men that I've worked with all these gynaus surgery and sometimes a lot of the guys wait too long. I would budget that into your bodybuilding career type of curriculum because at some point you're probably going to need to do it. I send a lot of people to Dr. Blow and White Plains in New York. There are other guys around the country that are getting good at it but Dr. Blow is the best if you look into the best he's still the best to guide a go to. But I would certainly you know I was in a rod. I took one shot at testosterone and I saw my nipple hanging a little bit. I went and got it taken out. I didn't want to deal with it. It was good because it creates a lot of anxiety in people because it doesn't look good. You're always playing with it and you know you can't get on stage without these judges saying something about it. If you have a bad get it taken out that's my best advice to you. Another good one here this one from sweeter fothel at what point in someone's lifting career slash lifetime should they stop trying to PR on mass weight is there such a thing. Very rarely did I ever try to just do a one rat max type of thing. Now when I was trying to move up and wait a lot of times you know the first time you attempt the weight you have to have you know you want to make sure you're trading part in his day you have a good spot because you're not going to be able to use the weight and sometimes it's scary. Remember the first it took me a long time to get 600 pounds in the squat because I think it was a mental thing in my head that was working against me. So I had to actually go down with the weight with someone underneath me and actually lifting with me so I can actually get a feel for the weight. Once I got comfortable with how heavy the weight felt on my back and got used to it I was able to move up. But I never ever went you know just to say okay I bench press 500 pounds that was never my intent my intent always was to do multiple reps with that weight. But sometimes like I said you have to get used to the weight and that might be a one or two rep with a spot type of situation initially. But I wouldn't be going for trying to just let's look at unless you're a power lifter if you're a power lifter and you're trying to go to set records then obviously you're you know that's a different that's a different mentality however and a different training style for bodybuilding purposes we're trying to get bigger. So we want to move heavier weight for multiple reps very rarely or very infrequently do you want to do one rep maxes. It's going to manzo low what carrier oils should be avoided when running injectables you'll see a lot of different compounds using different carrier oils and some say that certain ones are toxic the body. You know I really wouldn't know which ones were toxic. I never heard of any of them being toxic like you would never use mineral oil mineral oil is a amino stimulatory. So in other words you take mineral oil inject I know guys to try to use that as a site injection oil and they got really sick from it because your immune system attacks mineral oil. So you want a neutral and what we call a neutral oil that your immune system will not really respond to you know that's you know your your MCT oils your grape seed oils and stuff like that cotton seed oils there it is a hole hosted them and then the ones that have historically been used in all the oil based injectables out there you can just read the ingredients on the pharmacy ones see what they use that you should be using because these pharmaceutical companies have researched which of the best ones and which are the ones you shouldn't be doing. Unfortunately I think a lot of people you know they they buy you know the raw powders from China and then they can't get an oil and some people are using oil from the kitchen cabinet and they they think if they run it through a filter syringe that it's a sterile. So I don't know what to tell people it's a very rough time now if you use animal ox sterile right because there's no very few steroids are being made in actual factories anymore like pharmaceutical you know places where there's you know quality control and everything's tested it's kind of like people making it in their house you know and I don't care you know just just because it's in a nice box with a good label doesn't mean that it was necessarily made with the most sterile techniques or in the most you know professional way so it is what it is that's why I always recommend the people buy the Roy test kits I sell it daypalombo.com it's a bill well and product and test your test your stuff because you know what I've been saying 50% is is fake now I've been seeing more I would say probably 75% of the gear out there is not what it says it is so it might not be completely nothing but a lot of the injectables now are coming back as testosterone propane and a lot of the orals are coming back as Diana bowl you know that's understand what it's just the fact I know this because people buy these kits and then they send me the results and they tell me to interpret them I see it all the time I don't even have to ask people anymore if I have a client or someone who contacts me and said hey I'm taking this testosterone or I'm taking this deck up you know product and I'm getting super sore at my injection site I'm getting fevers I know right away they're using testosterone propane that's classic test propane you know side effects it doesn't hurt when you're injecting it but the next day or later it gets like bruised and then sometimes you actually get like a fever you can get you know chills from it you get almost like flu like symptoms because your immune system is overreacting to it classic propane also women they think they're taking out of our they're getting bloated they're losing hair and they don't understand why well because they're taking Diana bowl and they're not really taking animal so test your products as far as the oils go that are you know of concern use a prize that you know a lot of people have used don't don't use products that you're not sure of because buy and far if something is not a good carrier oil someone will have figured it out already hey stay away from this product but once again most of the most of the oils that people seem to be using seem to be reasonable because pretty much everyone uses the same stuff just be wary of people who say hey avoid this product a lot the really the best advice now is anecdotal if people say the stuff works pretty well then what it's worth purchasing and then testing it with the right test if it comes back what it says it is then you can use it and maybe you should buy a bunch of it and stockpile at a that point because there's not that much good stuff on the market anymore it's good to sell opal sb boss the best way to assess someone's genetic natural potential and we've discussed as many different various forms but I guess at what point does an athlete say or are they have reached their their I guess their genetic potential before decided to go in hands it's very it's very hard to determine that you know you could tell when looking at a person if they have good genetics for bodybuilding because you can see their bone structure did they have wide clavicles so they why they have a small waste what kind of a flare do they have to their you know to their legs bone structure is huge bodybuilding whether the person has the the mental fortitude to be able to put the size on now do the training eat the food take and they're willing to take the drugs that's another story all together as far as natural potential how far to go before you actually take an animal cycle it's impossible for me to give you an answer on that because everyone is different however when someone starts hitting a plateau and you know that you're eating perfectly you're getting all your meals in you're not missing anything you're doing to everything you can do in terms of supplementation you're training right and you just not progressing at that point then you got to sit down and say to yourself hey do I want to go to the next level do I want to take an amolix and and then that's a personal decision but how far a person know is really going to be dictated by their structure number one but then there what's up here in their head because you know my structure was good but it wasn't great and I went very far because I had the the the mental strength to do it and I've seen other people do the same thing branch Warren I don't you know he obviously had a nice structure but I don't think anyone in their right mind would have ever have guessed that he would have been able to pat on as much mass on that body as he did and and to go as high as he did winning two Arnold classics winning you know coming in second at the Olympia behind Jay Cutler I mean he really maximized what he had to work with because of his strength and his brain of his mind so it's a two tiered component visit genetic component and then there's a mental component unfortunately most people don't have both they have one or the other comes along you know as a rare individual that comes along everyone's in a while like a Ronnie Coleman that has both and that's why that he was so successful let's go to excellent one 87 Dave what are the pros and cons of natural test boosters for a natural competitor and could you also discuss what you should be looking for as far as brands and key ingredients you know when I design test the lives I can only speak to my own product because because you know I made it I always felt that the best way to enhance natural testosterone production is number one to reduce estrogen because we know that estrogen is what shuts down the pituitary and high epithalamus and the brain and prevents your body from producing more natural testosterone so if we can limit estrogen but not annihilated because we know that if you limit it if you get rid of too much estrogen you lose your sex driving and your and your androgen receptors don't have a lot of receptivity so you want to limit estrogen okay but without getting rid of it you want to limit your body's ability to convert testosterone into DH he literally doesn't build muscle okay it might give you sex drive it might give you you know secondary male sexual sexual characteristics but it's not going to give you muscle building and if we do that limit estrogen limit DHT we're going to have more natural testosterone by definition at that point because less testosterone will convert to other things then if we throw some direct stimulant or stimulators of testosterone production in in addition to that now we have a multi tiered approach to maximize testosterone in the body we eliminate estrogen which frees up the hypothalamus and pituitary to release more elutinizing hormone and and and and and follicle stimulating hormone which is going to stimulate natural testosterone production and sperm production if we limit lemonade DHT or lower DHT the ability to produce DHT more testosterone will stay as testosterone and then direct stimulation that's what I did with testolize that's why I don't call the testosterone boost I call the testosterone optimizer because it optimizes testosterone through all these different routes once again I can't speak to other people's products and I wouldn't say one's better than the other or worse than another I just know mine works very politely and it's one of our best selling products because of the science that I put into it take two-three more questions Tom holds worth over your thoughts on HH fragment do you think it's effective in fact burning you know these HCH or a growth hormone fragments that they produce are interesting because when they've done it they they they the growth hormone molecules of hundred ninety one amino acid for all so it's a long molecule it's all convoluted and everything like that and they found the different pieces of this hormone like if you clip this many starting as this many amino acids to this many amino acids they do different things and one of the fragments I know is they say is is the fat burning fragment it's the fragment that in other words you don't even need the rest of it just that fragment alone will bind you know and cause lipolysis or the liberation of fat for the fat cells on paper and in experiments however I'll tell you this I've never seen anyone use these fragments and get the same effect that they get from using real growth hormone the whole intact molecule why is that? Well be probably for the same reason that you know if you take a test the austro and you as a as a growth agent you grow really well you get some side effects but you grow and then if you take like anovar which is a derivative of testosterone which theoretically is similar and it should be even better because it's more it has more anabolic properties less and it's been a purpose it's not even close to a strong testosterone because when you start removing things and taking away the whole to use a piece of something you don't get the same effect and that's what I'm seeing in these fragments they on paper should be more effective because it's only the the fat burning component but they're not as effective as fat birds as as taking the whole intact GH molecule and that's the best analogy I can give you and that's the best thing I can only tell you what I see and what I know and the people who are using them if it worked as well as the real GH molecule don't you think everyone would be using it and it would be getting great results but they're not they're not and so that's unfortunately the reality of what's out there right now let's go to Carlos Benavita 7 blasting for six months massing cycle then transition of recontest with no change in testosterone short thoughts yeah I think testosterone should be pretty stable you know I think you know I find a thousand milligrams a week is pretty much you know what I am in favor of use the that comes out to about 250 to 300 milligrams every other day and that should be standard whether your offseason or pre-contest the that what I change pre-contest is I might throw in different antibiotics like mass around and trend alone uh wind stroll you know as opposed to maybe sticking with the more of the long acting injectable antibiotics like echo poise and deca and stuff like that and dianna ball I'll stick with more of the you know so I I have my certain drugs I like to use offseason I get the certain drug like to use pre-contest and then I'll also use like fat burning agents like climbed uteroll I might throw some cydomel which is T3 into the mix to help with that bring because the goal when you're preparing for a competition is not you're not really worried about building muscle what you'd built worried about is is leaning out and so the most potent leaning out substances would be you know climbed uteroll and T3 and grow homo to a certain degree probably third on that list and then maintaining your muscle mass with the drugs you're taking and having a hard look to it at the same time and so yeah I think it I usually go from offseason right into pre-contest and then I clean the person out after that. I've got a funny one I'll say that to the end it's going to send Tony strong your thoughts on grains and their effect on gut health the healthier your gut the more nutrients you can absorb similarly. Yeah you know there are certain people that are not very good digesters of wheat proteins or wheat in general gluten okay that's another way of saying it they have a some kind of analogy to it they're just their bodies attack the immune system goes after it and that can create a lot of gut issues obviously with inflammation and you know sometimes it can cause ulcerations and there's a whole host of different you know melodies that are linked to that grains specifically most people are not gluten incentive though or gluten allergic I think that you have a couple people you know I don't know what the statistics are how many people out of how many people but for most people they can handle wheat okay and they but a lot of people eliminated thinking that oh I got to go gluten free because that's what so-and-so didn't got such great results well so-and-so was had was legitimately you know gluten intolerant okay I had I have a very good friend my friend John Gratio he found that he can't have any gluten he anything with gluten and it hit it completely messes up entire gut he can blow it in he he feel terrible so does he go gluten free feels great again but he legit and he got tested he legitimately has an allergy to that stuff so for most people you can they can handle it and then I think that the best thing for gut health believe it or not is not necessarily giving your body a probiotic all the time because you want to maybe seed your colon with the good bacteria but then let it grow the best way for it to grow healthy is to feed it what's the best way to feed it soluble fiber soluble fiber is the food source for these gut bacteria they ferment it and they make energy for themselves for it and and fuel essentially which is good because when they ferment this soluble fiber they actually release these short chain medium chain fats into the bloodstream which tells the liver stop producing glucose so a soluble fiber supplement not only nourishes the gut bacteria but it also helps you with blood sugar control in the body which is great while you're dieting why because lower sugar lower insulin in the blood less fat storage so it all goes hand in hand so once again probiotics are good like if you're on antibiotics or something like that but once when you're not on those and you want to just keep those gut bacteria that are there healthy feed them give them a good fiber supplement fiber lies works really well the ceiling is is a great soluble source of fiber that the gut bacteria would they love to ferment this stuff and I think you'll you'll find that you get some good if you're looking and once again if you are an antibiotic so you do have some gut bacteria issues and you want to recede you can use probiotic foods like Bobby Salach route a coconut key fear or you can even go on a website like natrin natrin makes a really good powdered probiotic they have two different ones one's called megadophilist one's called bifidofactor you can alternate days do one one day one the next day maybe do a month of that and then fall and I mix it right into my fiber life supplement believe it or not but I won't do it continuously I'll do two weeks of it and then take a break off and maybe I won't use it again for another six months but I don't want to stop the fiber the fibers what's feeding those bacteria. It's good if a Robert cat and he's best site to shoot a stonstron or the quads okay. Nooo no quad injections go watch my video why you shouldn't shoot your quads I it's a very popular video you will get an infection I guarantee it it might not happen the first time of the second time it will happen and then you will be very very very upset and said do not shoot the quads ever ever ever ever ever trust me I promise you go watch my video you'll know all the reasons why it's funny whenever I say this there's always someone out there who's been shooting their quads and they've never had an infection and then the very next shot they take again infection after hearing my video and they're like why don't I listen to them don't shoot your quads the private best place is to put it into the glutes the delts side delts lats right here big juicy muscles that you can go nice and deep and inch in a half in and push that stuff in there and let it get absorbed that's the best advice I can give you. Good at Jason marks I at BD Pro what are these wellness pro competitors what are they taking what's there I guess gear uh regiment like you know they to me they look like little mini body builders and some of them have big legs in the body bulls so I would assume they're probably doing what the women's physique you know competitors are probably doing I see I see bikini girls that use testosterone as as as an a and as stupid as that may sound because their coaches put them on it that should never be the case obviously for me as far as I'm concerned if you know if I'm thinking about someone that I care about and I am worried and I want to remain very feminine and not ruin themselves and of ours the safest thing to do a little GHS say obviously the fat burners like you know clubbed or old side of me I'll have no side of X in terms of mass formalization the the probably the strongest any woman should do is would be something like wind stroll and always when women use anobox the best of the user are pills because orals are not in your system all the time so you're not being exposed 24 hours it might only be like you know 12 or 16 hours out of the day so anobar windshield pills are probably something that women can get away with without too many side effects pre-movell used to be good but 99.99% of the pre-movell and at least the injectable pre-movell on the market is safe it's actually test proponents you don't want to do that there are some pre-move acetate tabs out there that are available I think that 25 million rent pills those those would be all right maybe a crack them in half a half in the morning half at night those are those are drugs that are safe and the great thing about women is their receptors their energy and receptors are so so receptive to some they're so sensitive because women produce dairy very small amounts of testosterone in their body and it comes from their adrenal glands their adrenal glands produce the HCA which converts the testosterone in their tissues and so their bodies have to have really good receptors to recognize those very small amounts so when women put even the weakest antibiotics into their body like anobar their bodies respond them amazingly because they have way more sensitive receptors than the men do so there's no reason for a woman to take super strong drugs all they're going to get a side effects and you know what the biggest mistake women make is they start taking the strong drugs and they say oh I'm getting nothing but good muscle gains I have no side effects well it doesn't take a boy you know six weeks to go through puberty it takes years so it's a cumulative thing so you do test the ostrone for six eight weeks and or maybe longer and the next time you use it all the sudden you get a million side effects and everyone's like I don't know this then I took out the first time I had no side what was cumulative okay your your cumulative getting side effects women should not use anything more than when showing out of our last one of uh from booby bobby trap lord a good friend of the show is he name seeing as your legs were so big what did you do so the franken beans that in constantly shaving never your body bull is talking about that I am you mean I guess you know my legs were burned the guy I had a I used to walk with my legs like separated like you obviously the bodybuilder walk there are guys to do it who have skinny legs just because they think they're all like I used to legitimately have to walk out of separate my legs and so big but I always wore like like bikini underwear like you know they kind of keeps it tight to your body I don't know how guys do the the box of shorts with big legs because yeah your your stuff kind of hangs a little too low at that point but yeah I mean I always like I said I wore like some kind of a tighter you know closer fitting you know which is not good if you're trying to get your wife pregnant by the way but as far as holding everything in that's the way to go it's almost like you were imposing trunks all the time except they're you know they're made a cotton there you have it it's funny because I was kind of scrolling through the comments or whatever it's there was some back or there I guess is not something that bodybuilders generally talk about but there you have I don't you know I know I'm not gonna mention names I know a bodybuilder a couple of I was who don't wear who didn't wear and they may be even to this day they don't wear anywhere and which is I don't know how that you can possibly to me that's so uncomfortable I don't know why anyone will want anything you know just hang swing it in the breeze there that's got to be super uncomfortable especially for guys with huge huge legs because it kind of just gets smooshed between that so you definitely want to kind of hold it off a little bit that's for sure so I guess if we're gonna go with this is a terrible have to go something along the lines of protecting your Twickenberries there you go that's gonna be for this episode of ass Dave next week we will be back live on the shows so if you want to get your questions answer live on the show interact with us via the youtube comment section live comment section we'll be doing that we're also gonna be looking back to bring back iron to be as well perhaps any live format for Tyler Shore and Dave Poulombol I'm so deep for rookie we'll see you next time
