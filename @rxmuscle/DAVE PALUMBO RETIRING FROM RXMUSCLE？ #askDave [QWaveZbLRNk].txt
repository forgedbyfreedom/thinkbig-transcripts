carbs3 shakes without carbsWhen I add carbs next, do I add to shakes with something like oats150 carbs of 150 grams carbs dailyYou want to know where to add the carbs to?I am assuming?YesAnywhere, that's what I mean有很多人, a lot of guys that only give carbs有什麼味道, they like to have it with their food所以, I'll give them on the food meals that they're reading during the dayWe add rice and potatoesIs it like that?Some guys like to drink their carbsSo on those guys, I'll give it to them in the shakesWe'll give them a carbolized shake or carboline or whatever, they happen to like Hymolecularly like a little way carbolidizedWe'll put it there and the meals will stay without the carbsSo it doesn't matter where you put it Or you can just divide it equally Overall, your meals If you really want to, it doesn't matterIt really doesn't, because you've got to look at glycogen storage in the muscleIt's like a gas tank in your carb Giving you this analogy before To take is not fullIt's empty Or it's on the empty or side No matter when you put the carbs into the tank You're just filling the tank up It's only when the tank is full And you're trying to jam extra stuff And then you get spill over And the spill over in a person's body gets stored as body fat They've let me just clarify I'm essentially my fault So basically what he wants is no is Let's say he wants to add carbs to his shakes That's why he goes on to ask What are the alternatives Like oats, what else would you particularly advise You know that in carbs Yeah, two machines I used a lot of liquid carbs Back in my day there was ultra fuel From twin lab we used a little bit of gain Or a gain rate A gain rate never really likes It's kind of just pure sugar And gain rate doesn't have a lot of carbs And it's kind of very dilute I used a lot of ultra fuel I used grape juice sometimes There really was no carb powders That really were any good They were mostly just sugar So the best ones I found at the time Was the twin lab's ultra fuel I liked a lot Nowadays If you get to add carbs I would probably add like I said Like a carbalyze, a carbalyze Or a targo Something like that If you're looking for something a little more substantial That's not going to break down So quickly because those carbs shakes Get absorbed really quick If you want something that's going to be more sustaining You can certainly blend up oatmeal in there I'm going to tell you something about raw oatmeal And I do a lot of raw oatmeal in my shakes But I would make egg shakes with the oatmeal I would blend it in and I told you that before oatmeal that's not cooked It's just blended in a blender It's very abrasive When it comes out of your other end So to speak Because you might get a little Sometimes you can get like bloody down there Because it irritates your The anal tissue is down there Because it's really like sandpaper in a sense When you cook oatmeal It softens it up and you don't get that same abrasive from it So have that keep or keep that in mind When you're doing that You might want to use fruit Some people use bananas Because they're calorie dense Papaya You can use pineapple I got it to crazy pineapple stage for a while Because I had red and sourdicle About pineapple having good digestive enzymes in there And I was putting a lot of pineapple in my shakes So I varied it around in the off season Depending on what my mood was Because what happens is I'm the kind of guy They can do the same thing every single day And then one day I just say you know what I want different And then I'll do that for like three months in a row So go by what you want If you want to vary it fine If you don't want to vary it You happen to have one specific carbs source That you like better than those It's fine Most carbs are carbs Like I said If you're going for an oatmeal Which is a longer acting or a low glycemic carb You're going to get a more sustained energy release from it But understand that you could get some negative repercussions When you're when you're pooping it out Especially when you're doing a lot of Of oatmeal during the day Second question again from the deep Well, a more experienced app What is the exact mechanisms that provide health benefits From your fiber-lice And what is the optimal amount of fiber per day? All right, the optimal amount of fiber is is a skewed question I'll tell you why because Sillyam Okay Which is a It's just a form of a soluble fiber that we get you know in plants On a gram for gram basis So if you take one gram of Sillyam To one gram of opin Okay, which is usually one of the most naturally high Naturally occurring high sources of soluble fiber Sillyam is eight times more potent So one gram of Sillyam is equal to eight grams of like opin So you need a lot less Sillyam per day To get the same benefits you would get from eating like three bowls of oatmeal Which is why I use a very high-sual rate Sillyam in fiber-lice That's one of the benefits of it So you could take if you're taking it I think each fiber-lice shake has eight grams of Sillyam in it So if you're getting two shakes a day that's 16 grams of Sillyam You got a bolt on that pie that times eight That tells you how much real fiber effectiveness you're getting That's a lot Okay If you were to eat it in food So it's easier to take a fiber shake And then just add a little bit extra fiber to your day So fiber-lice has a gram of Insoluble fiber And one eight grams of Sillyam fiber That's nine grams So you look at it about 18 grams of fiber Most of it's coming from Silly If you're not using Sillyam you probably need like I said More like 60 grams of fiber But then again it's a lot harder to figure out the fiber in foods Than it would be from a shake So my suggestion is to take a constant source of fiber like a Sillyam based supplement Now a lot of people will say you know Dave I just I noticed When I use your fiber-lice it's way more potent And it does it does better things for me Than just taking like a metamusyl A sugar-free metamusyl or buying just pure Sillyam husk Why is that? And I answered this before but I'll say it again The Sillyam fiber absorbs water That's why it's called Sillyable It swells The amount of Sillyam in this Sillyam will dictate how potent it is And how much what kind of an effect it has on the colon The more it swells The more the colon has to work the push it through It becomes like Jello inside your colon And inside your intestinal tract And that's good because it makes the muskule cure contract on it It makes the digestive system work And that's what you want to do You want to get that muskule cure of the colon and small intestine in good shape Like to muscle You want to train it essentially Whereas some lot of Sillyam's out there because they're cheaper They get low-swall rate Sillyam's That have the some of the benefits of having use of fiber supplement Like lowering LDL cholesterol And alkalinizing the colon But they don't have the same effect on on really training the colon And getting it in good shape and moving waste through is effectively So people will say, you know what I'm going to take fiber I move my bowels I empty myself so much better high-swall rate That's what that does However you can get the health benefits of like an LDL cholesterol Lowering effect from any kind of a Sillyam based supplement Also When you take a Sillyam based fiber supplement It feeds the gut bacteria So the bacteria that live in your colon and your small intestine They feed off of soluble fiber They actually ferment it for energy And when they ferment it they release short chain and medium chain facts It actually go back and tell the liver stop producing glucose Okay because the liver is like constantly cranking glucose out Whether it be the gluconeogenesis Or whether it be mobilizing stored glycogen from the liver Into the bloodstream as glucose If you can slow that mechanism down You slow how much insulin you release out And you slow the rate at which you might store fat So lower insulin levels better from fat burning So a good fiber supplement will help with weight loss Because it keeps blood sugar levels lower Because it prevents the liver from cranking out so much glucose And that's something that happens all the time But if you can slow that by taking a good fiber supplement That's another benefit Obviously alkalinizing the colon Another really good effect If the colon is more alkalinized The immune system in the colon works better Less likely a chance of getting a of getting rogue cancer cells growing And then replicating themselves The immune system is functioning well It can eat up those rogue cancer cells And get rid of them immediately The immune system is sluggish in that area Because the colon is stagnant And very acidic That's going to be a problem So there's many many different benefits of taking in a fiber On a soluble level And an insoluble level supplement And until you use one You won't necessarily understand what I'm talking about But once people try fiber-lice And I've sent a newmerable tubs out the people Especially some of the top level body balls Who have complaints they've had You know problems with bloating in the stomach And they're not able to empty their mouths properly Especially before a show And they've tried it and they were like holy macro I know I know May rest of these Luke sand That was a big fiber-lice user So if you want to talk to anyone I was called Guy Sistineeno That's a big customer or a mine But it's important It's something that we don't like to talk about But if you're eating eight times a day You've got to make sure you're pushing all that waste out of your body And fiber is really that important Now I'm laughing because when we were all in the New York office Together I remember seeing some of the orders And it's like Wow So on a so-called For a life-really-less fiber-lice user That's what I've been saying Like fiber-lice We know how it works Let's go to the Instagram questions again If you're not following this It's official underscore RX muscle Got a lot of good questions But again, if you're watching us for the first time on YouTube Hit the subscribe button below If you like what you're watching Hit the like button Comment obviously that helps sound a lot If there's some suggestion Anything anything you want to see on this show Or any of other shows comment below As always we appreciate all of York's support It's going to clash with Paul Does a bodybuilder with a short torso Have an advantage in building a thick back compared to someone with a long torso There's advantages and disadvantages The short torso person will have Usually has lower connecting latch So it looks like they'll have to go right into their waistline I had that kind of a back development Because I have a short torso The negative on a short torso however Is the fact that Your abdominal region is crunched down So when you have a ton of muscle a lot of times It's easier to get that bubble gut It's phenomenal I'm going on because there's nowhere You're not spreading out your your abdominal muscles Sure overall longer period of time If you look at guys that long torso They usually don't have the gut problems Or or detention problems Because their their waistline is spread out over A much greater surface area So but those guys sometimes have short Attached latch And then they have a big gap between their their bottom of their lat And their waistline Not everyone Not everyone but some guys do So it's you know There's not such thing as perfection You either have one gift And one disadvantage And then you have another gift and another disadvantage So the grass is not always green or on one side You you dealt the deck of cards that you're you dealt And then you got to try to maximize what you have I had a short torso So I tried to maximize the amount of muscle I can put on my body to look like I had a lot of mass of my body But I had a you know, fight the you know the the bloating you know gut issue As I got bigger and bigger and bigger Because there was no place for all that muscle to go Now that I've lost you know a lot of muscle Purposely over the years Um my stomach's flat You don't even see it anymore Because I just don't have as much muscle anymore It's spread now I don't have to now I have less down there And I have like almost no no waistline But it really it's you know Our physics are amazing things They're so resilient our bodies They can change and reshape themselves And it's finding that perfect balance between too much and too little This is a question It's almost as if somebody heard a conversation from yesterday day Yesterday we were talking about Interviewing some of the up and coming amateurs Right like people love to hear about The you know newcomer someone who's trying to make their way But the whole ranks classic physique Nash actually just gave us a great idea and possibly our next show Dave would you ever consider doing a show on your channel where viewers and amateurs So I guess we'll say Lessils just tilted towards the amateur bodybuilder Those competing in the NPC Looking at eventually get their pro card Send you their pictures of their physique Or video what have you for you to critique I would do it But then I would I would have always people hating me Because you know I would just give it to you No I would do it that's fine I think it's a good idea actually You know I can give you my opinion Which is just an opinion It doesn't mean it's it's it's It means that much Obviously I've been in the sport a long time I can give you my my my got instinct If on what I think the person needs to work on And what what their strengths and the weaknesses are Obviously people who can't take criticism Wouldn't be sending in their pictures So that's a good thing But people wanted to do that I think we could do it for sure I think that it might be interesting You know sometimes I nail it Right sometimes I'm wrong completely You know and you don't know But I think that You know I know a lot of the fans like to know What the experts think about the upcoming crop And how they're going to do potentially in the future Usually stars you can kind of see right away If the guys that are the sleepers The ones that their bodies are late Blumers that sometimes you can miss You think wow they look alright But I don't know And then all of a sudden they They gain 30 pounds of muscle one year And they look completely different person That's the kind that's what happened to my physique I really didn't look that great in 92 And then from 92 to 94 I made like a 20 pound jump And then from 90 you know from 94 to 95 I made another 30 pound jump So that was 50 pounds in 2 years I don't think people expected that So I surprised a lot of people who Kind of gave me one critique And then they changed their mind when they saw that But not many people do that So yeah I'd be open for it Joe Denky how many times a day Should you drink apple cider vinegar Second what's the best probiotic I suffer from a distended stomach Yeah I don't know if the probiotics In a solid distended stomach Probably the fiber-liced product would help a lot more But I do agree that a probiotic is certainly helpful If you don't want to use a probiotic foods Like you can use like bubbly sour crowd Or like a coconut keafier If you don't want to do that And maybe you're dieting You don't want to add extra cows You can buy natrin NATR-EN makes a really good probiotic A powder probiotic That's what we were refrigerated They make one They're bifitow And they're lactobacilly I think one is for the small intestine One is for the large intestine Because remember we had different bacteria Collinies in different areas of the body And so you can buy by both We have both in my refrigerator home, my wife bought it And I'll use one one day And the other day if I'm feeling like my I might be out of whack Maybe I took a course of antibiotics or something like that And I feel like maybe my bacteria Some of the good bacteria got wiped out I'll use those Those seem to work really well I mix them right into my fiber-liced shape I think the fiber in the fiber-liced shape is the food for the bacteria So we might as well just put the bacteria into the food Mix it around I go up and down and let them have that It seems to work really quickly When I do get feel a little run Because sometimes you can take like Let's say you're on augmenting for instance For 10 to 14 days By day five or six You might start getting diarrhea And that's because now the good bacteria have been killed in addition to the bad bacteria So there's nothing protecting your gut lining So you put those new bacteria back in there By taking the probiotic With the fiber supplement And then all of a sudden it recedes your colon And your end or your small intestine And then all of a sudden the diarrhea stops And it's pretty dramatic It happens you could stop it with an end day Or so if you had a good probiotic in there Well it's going to be 120 And you made it a video of a day A couple of weeks ago Or it may have been a part of an nasty episode Where you talked about I guess Men who struggle to get up post cycle And what they could do Well this question Relays specifically to finasteride He says that his hair is starting to grow back One in a day, down side Sex drive One away Any suggestions on how to fix this You know Some DHT is necessary for your sex drive So if you're if you're if you're flat lining Your DHT too much with finasteride It could certainly affect your sex drive My suggestion a lot of times The guys who are having hair loss problems And or at the problems Is trying like a product like my finaster Like Testolize product first Because that will lower DHT levels Because it has natural DHT blockers in there But it won't lower So extreme like finasteride does Try that if that works Then you're good to go Then you're they don't even have to take the drug Because finasteride has side effects And a lot of people I take finasteride I've talked about it I've taken it for 25 years I don't have any side effects I never did It doesn't bother me It doesn't I don't have any sexual side effects I don't have any other weird ones I don't have any other people report So for me it works But for other people They may get side effects So it doesn't it's not warranted But they use it in that case Try a product like Testolize I think you'll get just as good as a result I'm a naturally high DHT converter I always knew this Because I always looked at my blood work And saw how high my DHT levels work Even on just DHT On all of everything I have high DHT levels Now When I got my DNA tested If you remember I talked about that Maybe about six months ago I had the DNA testing done Probably a year ago And I'm a very high converter Of DHT Of course this DNA testing Which is ironic Because it confirmed what I already knew And it also showed I was a low estrogen Aromatizer Which I already knew So Just because I see my blood work all the time So that kind of confirmed In my mind That you know what I need finasteride I'm on no HRT now I don't take anything Maybe an educational HCCH G-Shot And my DHT levels On finasteride 2.5 milligrams a day Are still just in the normal range They're not low Which tells you if I wouldn't be on that They would be probably through the roof I happen to convert a lot of test That my natural testosterone Or inject the testosterone Into finasteride Which means my five-alpha reductase Ends I'm system is high Which is probably why I had a lot of acne Is a kid And why I had hair loss as I got older Okay And my dad had prostate problems So I've been since I've been taking finaster For the last 25 years I'm hoping that I have averted the prostate issue Because I kept my DHT levels in normal range For so long Remember prostate will grow In response to high DHT Over the long period A long period of time It doesn't happen in the week So the fact that I've kept it low For so many years I'm hoping that I have averted that problem And that's why we do DNA testing That's why we check blood works So that we can see what our own individual Propensity are genetically speaking for different diseases And different disease processes If you can identify what you don't do well And what you do do well Then you could avoid the things you shouldn't be putting in your diet They're going to make you like I have zero Cointed DNA testing I have zero ability to digest lactose I already knew that Because I drink any milk or I take anything with that Because I get diarrhea from it But if I had known that earlier When I was born My parents would have tested my DNA I would have stayed away from my whole life These are the advantages of our children I'm going to test all my kids DNA to see what they're good at What they're not good at What I should keep them away For what I should put them in towards Or what foods they handle And they don't handle That's the advantage of technology We had this at our disposal now Hopefully you guys will use it as well We are up against the time But we have a lot of good questions We're going to see how many we could squeeze in here This one's from Emmett and Xuski How to keep balance during the back Double-by-separate pose I tend to lose my balance sometimes Yeah That's a common thread And no one ever really showed me how to pose It's funny We were talking, I was talking posing with Melvin Anthony When I interviewed a couple weeks ago And we were saying how on the west coast Guys really get into posing There's a lot of coaches They go into the posing room They have the gyms, especially gold's Venice People put a lot of emphasis on posing On the east coast Right group In New York Training is the most important thing Everyone trains hard core Everyone knows the east coast Guys squad dead lifted Do all the hard clothes No one talks about posing It's kind of like a lost art form there So I had a tough time learning how to pose I had to teach myself and learn by trial and error One of the things I learned is when you do In a back double-by-separate And you're putting one leg back The one leg that you put back Which ever leg it happens to be It doesn't matter There should be no weight on that You're not leaning back on that leg All the weight is on the front leg You're almost standing on that one front leg And balance There's no weight being put on that back leg The back leg is a pivot leg It's just touching the ground to keep you from falling From keeping you balance And if you do that It will enable you to flex that glute and hamstring That you put back If you have all you weight back on it When you try to flex that glute and hamstring It's not going to happen And you're going to fall down Or you're going to feel like you're off balance Because it's just not stable Remember all the weight on the front leg You're leaning forward And you're just pivoting on that back leg And just lightly flexing the glute and hamstring If you're in shape You will see Strations in the glutes And you'll see why you're in your hamstrings If you're not, I don't care how hard you flex that leg You're not going to see anything And that's the way it works But the key is not to put your weight on the leg That you put back It's to keep all your weight forward on that The leg that's, you know, that's the fur of this bat That it's excuse me On the leg that's closest to your body Let's go to black belt body building cripple The other side of the leg that's not confident Are you that the Olympia will remain in Vegas this year Do you think it might be moved to another state Because of restrictions I don't think anything's a short thing in 2020 So I wouldn't put my money on anything You know, I asked Stan Salman I had heard of Roman They were going to move it a couple weeks ago And he kind of laughed at me But I think that they're pretty much set on doing it in Vegas The thing is, well, they have to wear masks Because you remember the show we just saw this past week The show is a show that we're going to see in Vegas Everyone was on that, that's the next up on stage That would be terrible if they had to do that in December Maybe not so much for the guys But especially for the girls who, you know, beauty is part of the whole presentation Especially with figure and bikini and wellness So that's something to think about But I think we're going to see the show in Vegas I think that if they held it in Florida Obviously there would be a lot more leniency In terms of who can come and watch the show How many people you can have in the arena for the show But I think at this point they've put so much into it I know they were just out there in Vegas Looking at the planet fitness and everything like that I can't see them moving at this point I was going to, I have to be a tenacity Good friend of the show What can someone experience when signing up for your monthly coaching service If you can give as much details possible He's considering signing up within the next three to six months So I guess from the start in terms of his consultation To the beginning steps And into Vegas gradually the routine that you take your clients through Yeah, what was it for the yearly or for the toughest prep I figured what he asked about I mean he just said signing up within three to five months I have a couple different packages You know, all coaches offer different packages You know, what I do is when I first started with a new person I have the I usually ask them for their goals So in other words, what's your current goals? You know, what's the time frame on those goals And in other words, you want to lose weight over the next 16 weeks You want to put muscle on over the next six months I want to see pictures of what they look like now If they've done a show, I would like to see pictures of what they look like on stage To see what they look like in shape I want to know what they're eating now I want to know what supplements they're doing And I want to know what they're using gear I want to know what gear they're taking Or they have taken in the past So I have kind of a background information Sometimes people who are a little more, I have a lot of people have medical issues And I have complications Sometimes I'll get on a phone call with them Just to kind of get an idea of their story They're back story, what we're dealing with Whether the injuries or diseases they have Or whatever the case their restrictions may be I also ask people for what foods they don't like If they're allergic to anything And then I construct the plan based around what their goals are And their timeframes Once I send over the program they can They send me that questions and answers And I'll answer the questions And we go back up what this many times is necessary One of the great things about my coaching programs They get the person has unlimited access To ask me questions whenever they want With certain plans they can text me And call me whenever they want Some plans it's just all through email Really depends on what the person chooses I try to make myself as available as possible The good thing about me is I'm up on that Doing answering emails and working So very rarely do I have a problem getting back to someone You know I always tell people if I don't get back to you the same day With an update you know that you send me Send me a text message right away Because that means I probably didn't get it I get probably upwards of over 300 emails a day And then I'm answering on a regular basis And that's not even including spam emails And so sometimes one slips through the cracks Or it just doesn't make it you know Never I always tell people don't take it personally Don't think that I didn't respond to something like that Or I'm ignoring you I don't ignore everyone Actually another friend of mine said to me Why are you hire other coaches to work on you Like some of these other gurus do It'll take a lot of the workload off you And I say well you know The second I stop answering my own text Three emails is it loses the exclusive this Of working with Dave Palombo Now you're just working with some other guy That's you know that's not what I'm about When I can't handle any more clients I put a cutoff and I say I can't work with you I have too many people that's all Luckily for me I'm able to handle a larger amount of people Because I've been doing this a long time And so that's how it works It's nothing that complicated obviously I have people send me updates You know every two usually every two to three days And we've been a changes of necessary If we're down to like the ladder the wire Before a show a lot of times I'm getting updates every single day So it really depends on you know On the situation in the circumstances For a couple of more questions Go to TJ that gent To the different kind of question Dave I'm having done a surgery My doctor blow out Pretty recommendation I've already cleaned out Using gear this year Didn't really want to again he says I need to come over three weeks prior And after surgery Is that necessary Can I TRT through it to help keep games Or should I just come off completely I mean as far as gear goes You could probably stand a low dose HRT If you wanted to like a 100 milligrams a week If you really really wanted to I would personally just for two weeks before the show I would come off everything You're not going to crash into each anyway And then after the surgery You can go back on HRT Just say that you don't your blood pressure is not higher And then it normally is And that you know just for that purpose Really the more important thing Is going off nutritional supplements Take no nutritional supplements Two weeks before surgery Because a lot of those increase I'm not having time and we'll make you bleed I've told the story already When I first got my dinosaur surgery We didn't even know about that And I was bleeding like crazy Because I was on fish oil and vitamin E And all the things that we now know are anti-quagolants Matter of fact when I had one of my shoulders The second one that I forgot to stop Say things up and it stopped at six days out You would think that would be enough But I had a lot of bleeding issues I actually needed a blood transfusion Because I lost so much blood during that surgery The first one I did I stopped two weeks before I didn't have any problems So I'm going for a colonoscopy on the 25th I think I stopped all supplements Because I'm afraid of going there And they got to snip out like a polyp or something like that I don't want to stop bleeding I'm a bleeder Because I take a lot of fish oil I take a lot of vitamin E I take all the supplements They can actually keep your blood thin And prevent you from clotting Which is good when you're not getting surgery Because you don't want to throw cloths in your bloodstream Especially with COVID going around Which increases clotting Also those supplements are very healthy to take But when you're going to go for a known surgery You certainly don't want to be on nutritional supplements That may increase bleeding time So I highly recommend you stay off all Nutritional supplements for two weeks before the surgery Last one And I'm not sure if you have given this real serious thought Or if this will spark some thought And what I want to know Well Dave still be driving our ex muscle hard In his 60s Like he does now Does he have a retirement goal I thought I was retired already No, just kidding You know what I'm a workaholic As long as I'm enjoying what I'm doing I'm going to I will keep going strong with it And you know what as long as I can keep evolving What we're doing here And that's the key And said you've been with me a long time now As long as we can constantly keep evolving What we're doing And making it better and different And running rolling with the times In other words What the latest technology is And employing it to its fullest I think we will I'll do this probably till You know I don't even know what's going on Any more tool I'm in a mental institute Or whatever All day I chop Because I enjoy doing this I enjoy educating And I think the great thing about the mind Is the mind the body may fall Part of the mind lasts a lot longer So as long as I'm of same mind You know and we can come up with with good content And I can help showcase the bodybuilders And a positive way And make sure that the truth is being Told to our bodybuilding audience And to the people who are watching around the world Then I'm doing my job And I feel like I'm giving back You know that's the key It's it's constantly educating The next generation The next generation The next generation And you can never have too many people being educated Because there's just not enough information Out there right now There's no schools There's no schools The people can go to the learn stuff That we're talking about here And the bodybuilders Always on the cutting edge And the cost of the latest technologies too So what the general public finds out today We knew 10 years ago And that's the truth And I had that sort of eye enjoy I like being on the cutting edge Just not to the Pro one's too long I did research One year with a professor at my college I stayed over the summer We did research on Muscle development in chickens And how thyroid hormone affects that And one of the most fascinating things I found out about that was When I found out that the stuff that we were actually writing Scientific papers about Was stuff that no one else knew In other words, this research This professor was doing Was discovering things that no one had ever known before I was so excited That I said I didn't know That's what we're doing here He's a kid People don't know about this This is new This is new frontiers were forage We're finding out things about how thyroid hormone interacts With the body And it is responsible for how muscles develop In chickens which can be applied over the body Those Matter of fact, when I was working there In that summer of 89 I think it was They had furt just named Or had just recently named the hormone IGF1 It was like growth factor One, it had originally been called somatic heat So metamate and see They really didn't know exactly how it worked But they found that thyroid hormone When you're developing Increase the IGF1 release Which this is when you're developing As a member go And a young chicken So to speak And if you don't have enough thyroid hormone You don't produce enough IGF1 You don't develop the muscle On the level of the correct amount That you normally would So thyroid hormone is very important Because of its interaction with IGF1 So this is something that no one had ever known Before before this particular professor Dr. King figured this out So that was super exciting for me So that's why I get excited about Giving you guys new information That's being told I like breaking it down In a way that you can understand it Rather than just reading a scientific paper That you really don't know what it means And that's why I'm going to continue doing this Probably toll on who knows 100 years old I hope So there you have it There you have it there's your answers For all the rumors on this show That's going to do for this
