They're the millions that like the My father would call the pop culture aspect of a body building But let me answer your question if they said we're gonna run your autoplashing OK, what fuck the body building show fuck all the other shit You know just come and we're gonna have the X-Pose and everything You want to lose a purse everybody? No because that is a pop culture That's the majority of the people like like the least the whole idea of training and and growing and now drugs and supplements and Right protein shakes and all that's they love that because it's it's the cultural thing They don't necessarily care about the competing But that's the majority of the people but the hardcore body bulls are still there It's the same numbers. It's just a comparison to the rest of people It seems love that's all Yeah, water down, but what about guys that would John start it just before we start a talk at any age right What about guys like John and I am just gonna use John and I for example because we were there back in the fucking early early eighties. I'm 181 and you know and all that And I knew everybody builder who competed even in the fucking local shows and shit I mean I knew everything now how come you know What up it guys like John and I that don't really have that you know You're all men you like me you You become a sick that's all I think it's two things one is you know we got we got older and more More Disillusioned with the loss of what our brotherhood was right that's what it is you said it Yeah, we had when we Back then and Greg you know this and David you were there a few times you could have the worst shit Day in the entire world where would you go you went to the gym it's all your buddies were we had nothing to do Where'd you go you went to the gym because two guys were hanging around waiting to go eat or something you had you had a central You want a central community of like-minded people that was that that was Ironclad Accepting of you because of who you are and what you were doing and Greg and I because of we came up during that very intensified Environment of bodybuilding we missed that we missed out But what do we say back in the day we want it we want to grow the sport we kept saying that we got to grow the sport We got to grow the sport we need public mainstream appeal to the sport that's gonna make the sport grow and it's gonna make it more acceptable That's what's happening. I think I think what's happening You don't like you don't like where it's going, but that's that's unfortunately You're not growing a sport nobody gives you a strike you're not right because you're not gonna The majority of the people don't care who missed her limp your sport part of bodybuilding and there's the lifestyle part of They go together though, Greg without mr. Olympia. There is no lifestyle. There is nothing to aspire to You don't have to be want to look like I don't really curry to go out to the gym and train But that's what I'm looking at when I'm going to the gym and saying man I want to put muscle on you that looks cool even though I know I may never achieve that you know that that's I think we're to be on a cruise. I think that rich be on a prove that The people just want they people want that part without the sport just guys Focus it because people lazy great. They want to just take drugs and eat a lot of food and they don't want it That's really diet hard and have to do all the things that entail getting on stage You're competing practicing your posing suffering You know every day until you lose all your body fat They don't want to do that. That's not the fun part. So they'll do the other part which doesn't entail that But that's still that's still bodybuilding. You know I just thought it's you There's something there. It's not that we lost that taste Do you know what I mean like we don't it you're going to set it perfectly you you lot it was a it was a it was a time You think back to where it was so good, you know It's like when you watch an old movie and you say wow it brings you back to your high school years when you remember Was going to see that movie with with some girl in a drive through you know what I mean you say oh my god Holy I remember those are great times. You know and that's that's what you guys remember that gold gym camaraderie It can never be recreated again because it's right now The only way you can create it is go on Instagram, you know, we're ticked talk or whatever the case may be and And watch people doing kooky stuff on that that's the the sub culture now, you know Well, I I think the other aspect that I think is is part part Partially problematic for guys like Greg and me is that Whatever causes to lose interest in that It's it was back then it was happening right in front of him you're training next to this guy and then on a week And you see him he's on a stage. We know a fight for the America universe You'll live be out when I write there next to you, you know And so you had that connection to the sport because the competitors were right there with you training in the gym So so so now now when it when it's doesn't mean that much to be an ISBV pro Or have an IFBV pro card because everybody's got one, you know, and I and the beer top girl at rock bar is not an actual girl at an actual place That is a euphemism Okay, and before I get all the hate mail that Greg doesn't get because Yeah, I mean if people take things so literally a beer top girl's an image It's not a professional athlete. I know I'm looking at this girl and see it a Olympic pole vaulter You see a freaking beer top girl is what you see But can I see one thing for in a John I'm speak for John, but I think John's gonna great John and I will we talk like this and I want everybody who's watching is the know Okay, this is the fact we both love body building still we do it every day I have I have not lost a beat I can fucking cancel a whole bit knowledge it But I still train the way I always did I still take it that serious I'm talking about the competitive part of who's winning shows and who's not winning shows That's the part of bodybuilding that I think John and I don't give a shit about you know, and I mean I can't really you know I'm not saying John doesn't give a shit I'm interested sometimes that who wins the Olympic and all that the big things but I don't have it like I did But I'm still super into bodybuilding I worked out every day I tried good you know taking his you know supplements and it's all that stuff I do everything that it I've always done it's just the the commercial part of it is gotten so watered down And then I don't give a shit these guys did it all look the fucking same it's it's all of that that I don't So I don't want to sound like an old man Is that just huge as great because you're not keeping up on it because you know what I mean You know when you're younger certain things matter more to you and then when you get older You're you're thinking and you're and you're interest evolved so yeah You can't miss these guys world on social media world Instagram and Facebook we see them We see them just like everybody else sees them there's just there's no draw There's no sign no you know here's here's how you know the promise there's no backs You know how like when you go watch a movie sometimes in the character development is not good enough for you And you can't really emotionally get behind the character See you leave the movie kind of thinking wow it wasn't that great and then there's other movies with a Developed the character so much that you actually feel like you're the character in the movie I think what you're saying is that it's too easy for these guys and that's the so it's to move up the ranks Initially and it's hard to get behind people because You're almost don't know who they are because they turn pro so quickly There's no backstory there's no time to develop it Wait a minute let me use the bikini girls for one second If you go to a show okay, but this is what it is I think a lot too if you go to a show and There's bikini girls there and I've been backstage and there's fucking literally at one it to a universe Show did's fucking 400 of them okay, and if you said I'm not gonna say his name because I'm not gonna get trouble But there's a very famous guy who you both know who runs judging and all that shit And I said to do everyone in these girls is amazing how do you pick the top four and At you know top five and he said I picked which ones I would fuck first And I'll tell you who said that believe me And if I could want to say negative thing about this particular person, but Here's the point it's it's so watered down that you can't focus on the certain girls Even but then in those days you love the glass you love you know, let me ask you this question If you train Excuse me, if you If I know COVID I got I got I get a good code to do you train these girls Like your coach and bikini girls wouldn't you know who all the top girls are because that would be your job No, it's too many No, of course Is that too many you would know every single one of them because that would be in your best interest because you If you got 15 girls that you work in with you know Reus wait a minute to reason why I used to bikini girls I was using them as one I'm not putting bikini down I love to bikini I love I don't like we can say figure I'm saying if you trained girls You would know who all the girls are You wouldn't be saying this a million of them You know you know all the top ones are all the girls who are going to get the pro card are you would know them all Right, wait listen, I think you're missing the point I'm trying to make the big pool It's such a pool of people the reason why you use bikini girls was gate they for a while there They would get in the most competitors and there's so many of them. They so good right so but now What I'm saying is it's hard to zone in on let me like these particular girls It's the same thing with bodybuilding is what I'm saying there's so many shows there's so many pros there's said you don't have enough To zone in a back in the day when you when you said you know you don't I guarantee if you asked the judges They know who all the girls are Yeah, because that's their job right, but right so what I'm saying is your job has changed Maybe back in the day you were you would have been more into it because you're in the gym I'm so you know Jim you got all these competitors working out there Ask your advice you'd be looking through the magazine looking at all the girls so you know who everyone was But they know it's not it's not in your interest anymore You don't need that interest in bias. Yeah, but I still love baseball. I still love the same shit. I love back to listen when I'm trying to tell you It back then even even Up in the 90s when you're Dorian and all those guys you had about 20 to Maybe 25 guys that were really good Okay, and the rest it was just you know But you had 25 guys you could zone in it was more like oh who's gonna win you my kids? Gonna be this one it's gonna be I'm it's not some guy from the middle he shows up You know what's his name? You know mode X team or whatever That's because you don't pay attention. I know who all the top guys are. I know it all the names I Stop your job Yeah, it's my job But as fans right all right, let me let me let me change Let me just change something for you and then then you can say something Let's say there was no social meter internet Okay, it was an blackman had a thousand page magazine going now, okay? And that's where all the results and the body building was in there and they only way you can have any Tuck in touch get any in touch unless you go to the shows with bodybuilders read the magazine You would get your monthly magazine the blackman's copy of a thousand pages 750 would be ads of course and You would read through the pages a hundred times because you'd have a month to do it and you know who all the people were Right Greg Yeah, you're not willing to go to 16 social media sites and and a 4,000 Instagram Profiles it's too complicated That's what the problem is that's what it and that yes And that right there is the is the flies and the appointment Yes, it happens is the the prestige now right Go on yeah because back then People knew it was competing in the Olympia because it was it was that was it right The already whatever and we had the magazines it was a big deal was a huge deal Right, you're running a cover of a magazine It was a huge deal to have your article by you know you it was a big that was Press the right no any swinging dick in the gym can get his picture on the front Yeah, and he's talking about the appetite I'll put you on the cover And and get their by line on an article or blog or what it doesn't mean anything anymore Now just there's right well you have to establish you have to create your own prestige Look at like a dandelion valley for instance everyone knows who she is Yes, but that's it's like it was on This was on her to do that if I had a factory and I made ferraris Okay, and then and I would make two ferraris a year and it costs $8 million each because it was only two of them right now all of a sudden some German guy buys my company This is all you're doing this all wrong you gotta do it like that and now and now I'm making 5000 ferraris an hour okay, is it any less of a ferrar? No, it's still a fucking for everybody's got one right It doesn't mean anything anymore right? No, it's right great cards still the ultimate but it doesn't it doesn't have that Mistaken anymore because it's just everybody's got one is no it's not too easy What if they expanded baseball and they said you know what we're gonna throw another 10 to 15 teams and they're really making so that you have to That you would stop being like that's too much That's not it. Yeah, we'll whether it down right you need it I've got a formula race you gotta only race in that if you have a formula one car But now I'm letting it shopping cards mustangs doing buggy's motorcycles and it's a big cluster fuck You know, I got a lot of people love motorcycles and I watch it And I got a lot of people are like watching wheelchairs so they're watching and you got this big mess and like We're the formula one guys right there is way the fuck ahead nobody's even watching Just don't think that by watering down the sport you may say it's big and they're making more money by adding more pros and now You got to have somebody backstage that's more money and this is but the bottom line is The int you could get a rich piano walking in the room and fucking don't leave the pro bodybuild everybody to go run to rich because I Social media has made bodybuilding more of a lifestyle You know You know, niche and that people want to be around the social media stars They know that Mr. Olympic and walk to room look I just told you story Couple years ago I was at the Arnold Classic okay and a guy walked up to me wouldn't another guy He goes oh my god, you're above a but he said I got to ask you a question great Do you know this is then and next to me and I'm looking at the guy and I'm and you know He looks like everybody else that's walking around the expo, you know and I said I'm sorry I have no idea and he goes to me I told you it's that's so his friend I told you the told you and it was it was the guy who won the national that year So if everyone in assholes like think it was in 2016 or whatever it was that it was him okay now The bottom line is this They were trying to make that same statement they were actually making that to me like see You know he's not getting the recognition he's not getting all that you know Because the people on the internet Believe it or not if you have the national champ on your show you're gonna get people that are niche to watch that that really give a shit Who won the national you're gonna get that but if you had one of these new Nick that strength the next drink guy. I'm not really crazy about if you had him on there you'd have a hundred times more views and all that why because those the people social media has made bodybuilding into a Social media sports. It's like I've trained everybody's bodybuilding Yeah, but that's good. Greg that's bringing more people in you know It's not doing anything for the actual sport, but it's not it's not bringing it down It's it's just bringing more attention to it watering it down now Let me here's the question. I'm gonna pose this question to everyone Mr. J included you go each answer me. I want to sink the answer. I don't want to a 20 minute diet tribe Go ahead. How do we make bodybuilding great again? Talking about Trump slogan how do you make bodybuilding great in your estimation? What do you do? You want to go first Then you go first Dad John. I'll go first. All right. Well, I think obviously I'm gonna use the current situation To describe how you make bodybuilding great again. Number one is you get a guy You get a guy in charge to own the whole thing who actually has a passion for it and an interest in what's going on You got Jake Wood now. That's good exactly Jake Wood Versus David Pecker David Pecker didn't even know where the fucking gym was let alone one It looked like money inside a one let alone anything about bodybuilding now you got an a guy You actually knows the sport who owns the sport so Huge step number one and making bodybuilding great I'm not gonna say again. I'm gonna say bodybuilding Really great like it's never been so and that's the way you do it you get somebody with a passion for a money That has a vision that can pull from You know the amazing resources that we have out there people that have an interest in fitness and bodybuilding whatever and get them together You know create a create an online buzz about what's going on and and Promoting promoted with celebrity endorsements influencers who are are interested in bodybuilding they can make bodybuilding and the Associated sports that go away that look attractive and appealing and and the practitioners Interesting and people that are gonna that other people are gonna want to know more about and want to follow around And want to learn about and want to be fans And that's how you do it not by I think you can distill it down to this. I'm sorry I know you didn't want to die. I'm gonna give me one anyway In order to distill it, okay, you got to folk you got to refocus the energy if the focus is on On making money you're gonna have a different outcome than if the focus is Surveysing the fans serving the fans and serving the industry so if you're if you're a prime directive is to service the the the sport and and serve the sport and create opportunity create buzz create excitement create You know prizes opportunities all that stuff that goes along with promoting and and serving the Participants versus only working into in the realm it's gonna return you money I'm gonna spend this because I'm gonna get this ROI. I'm gonna get this money back If it's if it's all about making money then you're gonna have what what the the mess the Jake would inherit it Because that's what it was it was all about making money and that's what we got so Now hopefully the focus is gonna be more on the athletes the sport in the industry and less on Who's me making all my money and I think you'll see a quantum leaf phone Yeah, but I don't think I don't think it's possible I don't know I think with today people care more about watching the guys on here the action is see and some guy in the gym working out Talking if you had that if you had that okay if you had that whole Developed character as Dave was talking about and you and and social media Regular media was was promoting and and creating these images and these characters and you know about them Then when they went to compete you'd have a you have skin in the game You go yeah, I really like that guy. I want him to win right because then I'm other fucker I hope this guy be some but there's none of that though They don't have any calories mat these guys aren't calories men Yeah, why let me ask you a question why wouldn't why wouldn't the Olympic people you know Somehow Do some partnerships with TV you know or they or not it just they don't work now You know a TV's dying they need they need stuff like that, you know They should show like you You had I was working Oh Create a character like w w Create these characters in these story lines and create that and show the guys Yo that that he's got to wake up a tree 30 of the morning I'm more happy because he's kind of full-time job Because he's not making enough money and he's trying to go show all that with all the guys And and and they happen to have to come to practice and this way you don't want to watch him With the WB as they take a car you think somebody from the cat boat and they show them going up the ladder They have a whole character development division Yeah, that's the guy with me that's what Vince McMahon wanted to do right Even with that file you know these guys get a real out it would be so much other because then you like Oh, that guy that guy has to go work 15 hours and then he's going to the gym And then he's taking care of his kids he showed the show them as human rights I think lose good lose wicked great job Hold it lose wicked a great job with that didn't he when he was doing American muscle magazine I'm sure you watch that show you wanted to be on that I wanted to be on that show I mean, but I saw John Cook and I was jealous that I you know how did this guy land this fucking gig here? Me you you really were a mission Have a job on that show I'm missing a point though you missing a point No, I'm not because you know what they could create their own YouTube program And you don't have to be on TV Greg everyone watches YouTube now. No, I know that But that's what I'm saying YouTube yeah YouTube it's not gonna you the character development all that shit's on YouTube The problem is is that in my opinion there's no excitement it bodybuilding's not the most exciting You know to us old school guys wicked get excited by seeing guys pose on stage and we because we know what we're looking at everything But the average guy don't give two ships about that I'm just telling you they don't they'd rather see him in the gym Puffin going at home, you know the whole rich pianiting opened up a Totally different thing these guys don't have personality. There's nothing to sit up there and watch it's not like watching the UFC We've seen guys bash each other's brains in and I mean that's the fastest growing sport on the planet, you know It's right there's no way right You know Like the action's on your YouTube channel when you're seeing them in there and you get to hood on and your pocket facing around there And they're fucking living and all that shit in your screaming in the gym and and you know That's the answer but to sit there to fucking 20 guys posing to either fucking music videos doing it for None of you you know Black music doing a little stupid fucking shit that they do on stage and you know Everybody's going oh look at it. Look at it. Just did you like this, you know It's boring, you know It's just you can't sit to a fucking 50 people The same thing like the girls when the girls get up to take a 400 girls It's a kid falling asleep like this, you know what I mean basically Greg if I had gained free tickets to the Olympia bikini I should not give them to you. I don't want to my swimming god I did I Doesn't you know I love those girls those are my favorite and I I'm not Into like super if you want you love the one you want to fuck you don't love the one that's you think is the best Athlete because she's no Great as what I respect him I respect the fitness girls the girls When the girls are lined up with their ass face in the audience and they're bent over and it's like oh look at my head Glute ham tie in no one's looking at the gluten ham I don't think between their legs It's like you like to do it from fucking revenge and nerds. Oh, heopie You know what I mean Remember to you remember that the Chinese kind of an already a guy like they squeaks came in his pants Ah And they're a fix you know with the chicks Yeah, you know I can imagine in in in a in a legitimate athlete's mind What thoughts he's going through when she's got to turn around and face the curtain and bend over where a leg spread I know How was that opposed though? They have real estate That was designed for us fucking are like Up to the fifth seventh row and and you know Stendor like dancing and expect that everybody's looking at her you know Stelberg I never ever this did have that pose Pat. Remember back in the day you couldn't do the moon pose and body Going show your hamstrings glutes. Yeah, I mean that was pain compared to what these girls are doing on stage I like to little importate I mean that affect the girls that are at the top don't do that. You know if you notice they don't bend all over They don't need to try to cross they cross the leg. They do it in a much more sophisticated way and I think This is off way that those girls those girls crying for attention boy They can stick that chute shop to the fucking back door I've never seen anybody arts from back so much like that You know what their posters prize out the door I was at that unit was closed post down and I was with Robbie Durand and Jo Pia Tarot And I in Jo Pia Tarot you know so many motherfuckers are a little bit Okay, and he said to me to class a client after like all these girls came out He said to me I should have got a never thought it ever said it to my lifetime He goes but if I see one more fucking bikini I think I'm going to fucking spit. You know I can I kiss because after a while It's like if I showed you playboy magazine at the playboy at the playboy You're like okay, okay, I get it. I get it. You know it's too much they water down the shows You don't have the elite competitors That's what I was trying to tell you before about that and I'm not just using girls bikini I mean even bodybuilders You knew there was like 25 guys or 20 guys actually that you could that we're gonna go for the Olympic We're gonna go for all these pro shows and you had you could focus on that you know I'm saying Now who's gonna show up fucking John if I if I told you name it like the guys in the Olympic You wouldn't even know who's who's this fucking guy You know, I mean it's this fucking mode X team and fucking you know what I mean And you know you understand what I'm saying But great why did you why did you know who these guys were back you know 10 15 years ago because you're red That's it was all they got from one of our article about it or Peter McGoff wrote an article about these guys and you're red it And you knew who they were because you learned the background That's what you can do no, but there was 20 of them listen to me when you went to school There was 15 kids in your class maybe 20 kids in your class You know everybody in the class, but if you sat in a classroom with fucking 2,000 people You'd be like an I've been in the same class for fucking four years and I haven't you know That's where it happens when you go to college with big university you sit with 300 people in the class You don't know no, you don't know everybody in your class No, you don't know you don't but that doesn't make it the learning experience any less. It's just means no, but the thing is you don't this is a body-belicture She can't really it's hard to say So what you're it but now what you're what you're saying is that they should not have allowed the sport to grow That's what you're saying no not grow grow that way That the elite should always remain more money in the sport There's more people there's more interest you got to grow the sport There's not more I don't win them a hold on I disagree with that There's more money for the fucker promoters and everything But you haven't grown the sport with the people out there get this shit nobody gives you shit They'd rather watch that fucking great-duke kid or whatever the fucker's name is You know when rich pian and all that you know what I mean Let me give you an example MotoGP motorcycle racing there's six copies Six that whose name you hear every race first second third fourth that they're the same guys The same ones Valentino Rossi Mark Marquez the Vizio So he's at the same guys you see him every week every track The same six guys so is that sport growing one of the biggest sports in the fucking world It grows every freaking year, but it's the same six guys winning the same six guys So free to say the Olympians the same top six when it's the same top six every pro show It's the same six guys same six guys. It is the sport growing I don't think you can go you can't measure it by the by the how many practitioners there are you got to Remember by how many people want to see it by giving away too many pro cards John you're creating too many people that have the The key to get into that show That's a challenge It only the only the best is going to rise to the top though Right, that's the point on making so it doesn't matter Greg you're a hundred percent right It doesn't it doesn't matter how many people are they can call which competing for it It matters who are the top guys and why do you want to know who they are right and you know what into your To and I'm agreeing with you if you're talking about the top six guys in motorcross or whatever it was right Now now let me taste something if they if they had Fucking fifty guys going for that and one shot you'd be sitting and going I can't sit to all these guys doing that shit You would wait and watch those six guys am I right along? But I'm any guys you see you know again, you know Ed Beckley fucking earn revenue it's always talking Whatever you go get some out in the lobby go take a piss but now oh shit You know Jake Hotler's coming up He's gonna pose like seconds and you run out there and you watch him you right what I'm saying is They've made it so watered down that it's hard to focus on this sport because to every There's a new guy did you you put these guys on your shows I don't even know what the fuck they are and you know They're all super jagged you know trading like it and they're all fucking you know giant try everybody's fucking big Well that's why that's why active I have to feature these people because otherwise no one will know the back stories on these people No, that's why this that's why our ex muscle and sites like us are so important because we are the magazines now And when we feature someone on here, and that's why a lot of these you know the upcoming guys want to be featured because It validates them in a way that the magazine just devalinate us when we were coming Yeah, but I'm not putting it down. I'm not saying it what you're doing is bad. Oh, I don't know. I know what you say But that what you're doing is there it's necessary. It's necessary. Right. It's necessary. It's great But when I'm saying this I don't know who they are You understand what you're doing Sometimes you got to pay a little more attention, Greg Yeah You don't know who they are because you're not excited about no one who they are right It was if it if it's stimulated you want to well wow I want to know more about that guy because You you you watch an interview on our ex muscle and you found out wow we're from the same town Or we we were into the same high school and we we knew we knew the same girl and the It was a cheerleader or whatever so I mean Once you know more about these people what David is saying and when you know about them You know the back story when the characters are developed when you know them There's a greater chance that you're going to like them and follow them in care about instead of not caring You've got to make me want to watch them but the only way you're going to do that the only way you're going to do that first You're going to have you got to want to know about the sport so you got to A care about the sport avoid of any personality You got to care about the sport you care about the sport you're going to watch our Ex muscle you're going to watch everything on our Ex muscle you're going to write a new care I do care about the sport which it's it's become again it's hard to watch if they Sports expand even like baseball if they had it in another 10 teams it's But that's what you're saying is but what you're saying is the number of events Have water down the the blanket organization there's still only top 10 guys in the Olympic right But now the garden's got a lot more weeds in it. Where's the fruit? Yeah, it's still one of them that it that's what you want what you're saying you don't want to get to all that To get right I don't want to get to a weeds to get to the fruit you understand that's what I'm saying I can also what this like girls with long pubic hair you don't want to weed you all Dude I'm a 70's guy I like that Dude I like the bush bro a 70 I'm 70 guys Mr. G what's your what's your take on this? On the whole thing is that they should like develop a link at W to be characters and the guys have to be You have to be brought up to show them what forking Regular jobs family all the things that they had included going to training like this used to show When the guys in the Olympics You can be seen with show the guy training and how much tech aisle XC I would eat They show me all the food and stuff like that and very lift and you know Kind of the public character inside him so this way is gonna make you want to watch because that's that's the Ultimately how these guys want to make money they have that personalities they have to have a party without a personality If you just like above Them forget it that's why when we went to the company had the Trend when we were at the Arnold stage They had oh you could have 10,000 girls next to us nobody did Everybody was watching us because we're in the team We're interacting and that's what needs to happen I We do have character development see the character now today's they go to YouTube What's gonna make them want to see that guy on stage is what I think with Dave's trying to say because they are there is character Development everyone of these guys has to wrong YouTube channel right they post their fucking meal every meal The eat on Instagram you know what you mean it you get to see their lives on oh There's no there's no formula for that for success because you can have some guy in every man herd I've got 3 million followers Right Who is he in every man herd of then you got somebody Seeing as somebody who's like a fucking legend they got like 230,000 followers And you know exactly what's that at all? 230 to show us that fucking Can't even get 10,000 for it's it's strange it's a fucking odd thing because the internet I think is what's caused this is what I've been trying to say Well who's responsibility is it to promote these people But what is it the organization is it the Olympia people is I mean like the organization who's responsible Well, you know, that's a good question Dave because that that right there is one of the one of the elements we lost when we lost the magazine Yes, right that's what we're trying to say when we worked for the magazine If I want to see a bodybuilder he went to a show and he got the magazine now today It's all over the place and that's what I'm trying to say back when we were all together working it You know for the magazine it was a different era It's before there was YouTube it was before there was Facebook it was before there was an Instagram It was before there was TikTok and all this shit the these guys now put themselves on all these platforms I don't need to go to the Olympia to see like oh my god, there's Jay Connor or you know It didn't need to do that do you understand now they do that you know that They would have to go to show to see that Yeah, right a 16 year old kid nowadays is not going to open a magazine Okay They only know Instagram Tik Tok Facebook Yeah, but you're validating everything I'm saying I'm saying because of that But I'm saying it's and it's you can't He says that's the era we live in so how do you make bodybuilding great according to your depth? I think it is great still but according to your depth and how do you make a great using the tool set that we have right now I you have to get you there. There's no excitement in it Oh, I'm making you in charge. I'm making you in charge of the organization. What do you do? My rep is circus by doctor Zeus Wait, I I mean I I think everybody's right. I think George is right about the characters and but that's being done already on those platforms How do you get people to go to a show? You know what I mean? It's like when people say to me, Greg how do you get dates to stop doodling during the show? That's that's the new thing That's the new thing I made a very I made a great painting I don't know if you can see this I'm gonna send it here. I'm signing and I'm sending it to you I don't have you can see it from where you are You'll see it when you watch what's the truth will set you free You know that that's the big that's the big for a conversation on the on the thing Listen great can you please tell Dave to stop do what is he doodling Dropping pictures of you guys I'm trying to on you that like to have like the guys in the courtroom They actually they they that like Sketch Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Um, anyway, I think we could beat the subject up to death.
