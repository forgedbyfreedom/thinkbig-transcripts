Well, the new chance to see amino acids from the protein, the glucose from the carbohydrates and fats from fat and jacin will all get absorbed in the small intestine, believe it? I'm not the largest. The larger intestines will flow it in electrolytes, get reabsorb. However, you're right. When you add other foods and combine them with the proteins, it slows the jacin transit time. So, if you take fat, for instance, whether it be peanut butter or a tablespoon of oil or whatever or a whole eggs and you mix them into a way type of a shake, you will create essentially a food and a complex food that will then once again slow the absorption of the amino acids into the bloodstream. The problem is once they get in the bloodstream, they're still absorbed very rapidly because they're ready to go. But yes, you can create meals out of shakes and that's a lot of people do that. And I recommend the people do that. Carbs and it's a protein don't slow the transit of it as much as fats added to protein do. Because what fats do is when fats hit the intestinal tract, your your gallbladder and your liver releases bile and bile tells the intestinal tract to slow down. So instead of going at this rate, it goes at this rate. When things move more slowly through the intestinal tract, you can absorb more of the and you absorb it as slow or rate. But you absorb it more slowly also.
