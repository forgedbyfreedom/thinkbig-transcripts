Light on the key with the eye and the feel of the back Wanna on a beat and twist and she goes so sick Step ahead maybe I'd like to watch Just see the crowd and we'll try Otherwise it'll go your way Can we learn other aspects TodayI Mind, I'm already dead What is your life? Is your life worth so much? What will it be? Because we just give it a life Just you and your hands tonight What is your life? What is your life? What is your life? What is your life? I will never leave, but not even till the sky Is your life, I'll you, I live forever When you change your mind Hold me soksawed, I still must act It's time, if I can't forgive myself
