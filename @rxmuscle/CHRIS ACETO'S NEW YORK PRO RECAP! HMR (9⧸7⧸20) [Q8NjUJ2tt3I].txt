Watch us! Welcome to another episode of Heavy Muscle Radio on Dave Palombo Join as always By the technician Chris We froze already 10th and 7th actually 2020 evening Chris we had a big weekend In body building I've waited six months to say that Those words It's true we had the North American championships Which might have been the biggest amateur show All times They can place in Pittsburgh I who knows how many people they had They had over 1500 And then of course with a new year A pro which wasn't in New York But it took place in Tampa And you were actually in attendance And for those you might be wondering It's like 12 30 night And Chris is very disheveled Because it's the head of the World Week I'm in Tampa I'm in Tampa I'm going to go in there I'm not doing the radio show It's like midnight when I fly home from Tampa Because you can't get to Maine from Tampa Directly I'm going to take a break I got to ask you Your home school you kids You keep everything It's going to school And you somehow How did you convince your wife Let you go and fly out of the Tampa For the show Well Because I didn't really convince I was going to say when me and my family went to Qatar With Kamal Right On and his wife Came to visit us Oh I didn't Yeah you know them They're nice I mean he's like shy and quiet And you know his wife was like conservative and nice And just it was just like really nice To my wife and my kids So your wife felt like you'd be there And her son speaks not one word of English Still he still doesn't speak English Not Dave when he was in the post This was book I'm getting ahead of myself But I was screaming behind my tight your legs Yeah he didn't know what he's talking about You know what I'm sorry So he don't speak English So my wife said You know I said the new you're coming up in Tampa Yeah Oh go ahead and she's like for who And I said well you know Patrick Morris doing it Jason Loss She's like who are those people Yeah And I said you know she knows him Yeah So the type of connection she's like well you know go But you just have to get a COVID test when you get back Yeah you wife might go have to quarantine until for two weeks Chris is like Yeah I get another I get two more weeks of vacation time now I don't know I don't know I can hang out in the in the guest room Please please please please so Yeah Well that's that Here I am in Tampa One more clock in the morning And bodybuild back Yeah that's what it looks like that's good So good Well you know what let's do our official RX muscle Tampa Pro Well that's that Tampa Pro It's new you are pro in Tampa The official breakdown of what happened He invalid Yeah coming home with the victory After the Tough loss a couple weeks ago into the real Tampa Pro show He comes back here he does win But he still looks miserable I don't know what his problem is What why is he so uncomfortable I interview him after the last show And he says you know I get stressed out of these shows It's a lot of anxiety for me I say that doesn't seem to me like you enjoying the process He's like well I don't really I love bodybuilding But I really don't enjoy the whole competing process I get very nervous and and worked up It seemed like he was a little stressed out here as well He wasn't smiling as much he did look better I thought that he didn't tamper Give me your assessment of of Ian From Tampa compared to actually the near pro now Was he better and did he deserve the win Well I was a win What does that mean? Explain Nothing Nothing Nothing To that leaves a big impression about that win Meaning I mean you can post up that back shot People say it's like morph to something You know, Instagram Not There's you know he's not peeled I mean he's the winner So you know Was he the best man there? That's what people want to know Do I think he's the best man there? No Okay, so you don't think he deserved the win What what was better about him from Tampa to New York and and what in your mind was still not good enough His can was better Not that much better though I mean I still think he was he still think his tank had been better though Yeah Come on I mean It shows It's bodybuilding So it's I mean Is this like like top notch conditioning? Well I mean he looks good to me he just doesn't look he look you can even look at his face he looks like I want to go home That's that's the look he doesn't have that beaming smile That most of these guys have after you know when they're Competing to win a shot I mean I think of Sergio leave a junior with that I'm so happy to be here you know smile every time he's up on stage You know that's what I'm used to saying from bodybuilders Yeah, I mean I just the mean the fact that a matter is when a boil it all down You know he like wide with a good front last spread and I just I I'm That locks first like you know I would say like You know I'll ask you as he peeled here So let's just play double zamp Okay, does he is he is he very hard All right, this is this is the back shot you're talking about Let's talk from behind Yeah He's not as glutes and hamstrings were not as peeled as and it they probably are a little harder than he's not really hit him completely here But you can tell he's not crisp here. Well this is back detail Yeah Let's let's pull up some let's pull up some comparison shots So I think that might that might work better for us and we can look at what the line up looked like You know and that first call out Yeah, talk to me a little bit when you first saw them all come out together And they call that first you know that top seven grew about give me your assessment of them Um, apples and oranges Too many call out at once But I can I'm smart enough to figure out you know the apples from the oranges Um, you sell it showing right with all the fruit all the fruit and allergies you get it I don't like it's one in the morning. I want to listen Um, I'm pretty still involved about it building Here's your first one. I'm a black that right there Can you see that Chris? Nope. I can't see it. Just tell me who it is. I know exactly what these guys look like I watched every did this show in detail Okay, this is the first the front double by separate Antoine Valiant Antoine's been first call out for sure Right. Yeah, I was I was not that impressed with Antoine. You know and when I look at is When I look at is Instagram stuff Well he's got to decide if he's going to be an Instagram bodybuilder or real bodybuilder What does that mean explain that because people look I mean I say it all the time and people look like I think I'm kidding is People post up pictures and they look like Dorian and they don't look like that in real life So I mean I don't understand why they do it I mean here How do they do that though? I don't say they do that you know It's the same it's like make a effect Right someone can throw on makeup and like lighting and then you know you get a gorgeous girl And then you you go see her and she's not gorgeous. Yeah, so that's the answer one from That looks nothing like Instagram Pull up an Instagram photo of front double by South, see which guy wins Let's do Desirees You know Do you think that he that he just maybe over-depleted to the show? He just because he looks really good on Instagram, you know like you say you know That's the point. I mean so who doesn't or maybe maybe he just has one of those illusionary bodies, you know Right Illusion No, no, no, no I'm going to show you I'm going to show you There's the answer one in his Instagram, but look how high that's hydrated and that's all filled up Let's see which one he looks better on Yeah, yeah, that's that's not the real in on right Yeah Well, that's the answer one we see an Instagram, but I mean maybe he's impossible to He did over-depleted here and he did you know suck out too much and maybe he sacrificed some size and some fullness Um, could be I mean could be That's a that's a real possibility I mean it's either one of the two he's he just sacrificed, you know he flattened out Or he just doesn't look like those Instagram photos in the first place Yeah Well he finished his seventh year he was seventh place And you know this is still you know he've run me at 20 by set You missed all of 2019 Sees and essentially he has a competed since Toronto and 18 So I mean this is I guess a good come back for him I mean I I think that I think he was just over-depleted here to be honest to be a conditioning look good to me Yeah, he didn't look like he belonged in the first call out to me because it was a tough first call out Yeah, yeah Alright, let's first let's go back to that comparison And we kind of like um, the vertical look Okay, we can do our tjoshio Front double is obviously Antoine doing Walker John Delorosa Hassan's off from going from the left Invalier Abe you got the wrong people in there. There's no Walker in there Oh, excuse me Max Charles I'm sorry I'm thank you. It is late tonight my mistake. So it's Antoine Valions Max Charles John Delorosa Hassan was off a Invalier and Patrick Moore Patrick Moore and Justin Justin So you see this first call Was this a good top seven that they called out were you happy with this group Yeah, I mean it was a good you know it was a good top seven minus Antoine who do you know why don't think really good right who would you have put in there instead? I I think they don't need to call seven. I think you can call you know six and figure it out from six. I just think it one you know He was any threat to in any way to the other six you know what I mean? He was not beaten that Olden His space with them on any any poses Right Now when you first saw this Hassan was in the middle Did you think that this is with the way it was gonna stay? Yeah, I thought it would be a done deal for that my thought was a done deal for when he came up by himself so And people were going crazy on the live past Yeah, I mean they were going crazy because he looked crazy And when they moved them off the middle but did that was that that was a bad call confusing to you It was a bad call yeah, wasn't couldn't no wasn't confusing to me. I was I was just I mean I wasn't confused. It's called a bad call All right Okay, I'm I'm asking your opinion. Obviously. This is just your opinion Yeah, I know me losses there too. What did me a loss? Huh? I heard I know me losses in an attendancy health max trials. What was me loss was me Let's go in crazy? No, I mean, I think me low start see the problem with met you know I mean, it is apples and oranges like everyone there has some type of strengths max has got tremendous density And muscularity in certain charts overwhelming crazy most muscular Mobile crazy hands on hips most muscular crazy abs You know side chest is borderline crazy, but he's got gaps of course, which is his back But standing from the front you know he looks you know really good You know also in that line up was Delaro's a too soft Um A lot of people thought Delaro's a mine of gotten the the nod you know on this one Which which a lot of people? No, I'm just saying that the speculation looking for judges or whoever you know Tyler I know Tyler man was the head judge He had these guys positioned as one and two after pre-tudging right. I mean the way it was set up Yeah, that's how it was positioned. Yeah It was that was that an unpopular decision in and from when you from where you was sitting with all the people I think the I'll tell you the the pre-jet and the two people who got the most response from the crowd because you're asking about was that a Popula decision so you're asking like what was a crowd response Right the two people who got the biggest like wow Was Hassan and just done I'm a quickly those people that people like sit up and say wow You know and they would say go through their mandatory as you say wow you know Um And nobody else I mean I wasn't saying nobody else but those were the two you know Yep, well he has that he were looking right now at the top four this was the final claw to pre-jet It was Patrick more John Delorosa in Valier and Justin Rodriguez. Yeah So obviously They were positioning these four as your top four yeah Hassan was not in there Okay, at that point yeah, no What in close now? I know a lot of people were were not happy about this because a lot of people felt Hassan deserve for the up there What was your thinking did you think that they would make it a change? In your estimation that Hassan looked different at the pre-jetging from the night show and you that much different Not one bit no So he should have been up there right from the beginning is what you said Which seemed like it was verified at the night Did just just just ask yourself this because if you want to dissect it Okay, this picture you're looking at is the reality of this picture is that leaving pre-jetging probably Delorosa Because he's next to and Valier are in the middle and they're battling out for which play state First in second first in second tell me where Delorosa beats Hassan was stuff on what shots Well, I don't know you were there you tell me Well, you just go by pictures and you tell me I send you a pretty you know mean Well, I I thought Hassan looked in saying you know I think you know to feather twides in and Oh the answer because I was I was there and I it's a retorting question and the second follow-up to that We had this in Valier really beat On what compound to bodybuilding and what what Aspect is he beating Hassan in I think the only thing that in his better at is probably just his width and and his structure in terms of size Would you go like that he's why yeah, he's he's wider And I think sometimes judges can get bamboo's will do that initially initially they work through that though Delorosa fights not a width contest But it is to a certain you come up Um, okay You could argue that because he's wide he doesn't even have enough muscle And and does not have enough because he is wide Yeah He looks like he on stage Yeah, so you want the actual great play right for a break down Ian has the same issue that Wolf had don't you think in a sense With figuring out fullness versus Conditioning Yeah, but Wolf could get peel sometimes well I mean both competed a lot more than Ian I'm just saying Ian seems to be suffering that same Delama of what do I do do I come in full and not as hard do I come in ripped and and fold it's a good You're right for tall guy for tall guy with a lot of width which he has It is hard to You always play that you always struggle with that because you're trying to fill that frame out Yeah, that's a big frame and You try to fill it out and you're not tight enough and then you try to like say shit, you know People said I was entirely enough and then you try to burn it down and then You get tight, you know really sharp and you say oh you know big enough Right and I mean that's a that's an impressive shot the side try so I'm putting up Which one he's got it? I don't I usually you can see these pictures. I don't know what you can't see But this is I have a side try set of Ian Valier up on on the screen Yeah, and he's very impressive in that shot Yeah, he looks good in the side tries He looks so there is obviously look the guys got some serious talent What did he miss the mark on at this show was a conditioning fullness? You tell me like if you work his coach what did he do wrong? Both he was like low flat and low watery I mean that's why that's why you get that disaster backshot I mean you can have a That that says at all nothing's popping and nothing's pulling is that in your estimation nerves Anxiety or is that just he didn't do his homework? No could be it it actually could be nerves because I mean you can be Pretty damn full and hard and if you suffer from anxiety And you worry about what you're gonna look like at a pre-judging It's called being washed out when you and that just means you need the full-booking or hard-looking Right, and then you need a pizza like that night you wake up with no stress the next day and have two beers and you like peel Right, and is that what you think is going on here? I mean because you're right He looks like he's flat and he's just this is a lack of sharpness there and he looks very unhappy in his face and I and like I said He's like one of the nicest guys like you know, I've ever you know, I've ever met He's even he loves body building the guy will talk body building all day one He just doesn't seem to enjoy the competitive process Yeah, and It seems to cause him a lot of stress and anxiety even by his own admission That's not me making this up, you know, he told me this on an interview. So That you know that that's a problem that some guy suffer with their whole career you know that oh Yeah That's not uncommon Yeah So I mean so I mean the packed people But the era the delts could be you know he's got the Brain sense and it's like it's a curse you know what I mean because you do look good in the lineup right I mean he does you can't think but lineup he's got wide shoulders this hips and narrow I wish you know He's got big shoulders You know for big guy he's got full enough legs But the knock is always gonna be you're not full enough. You know big enough right Let's let's talk about second place Justin Ryan Regus who's another guy who was not in the second position or first position after pre judging and a lot of people I don't we're talking that I don't You know what yeah a lot of people was thought he you know at least the life stream people that were watching thought hey here's the winner and He didn't he wasn't in first or second position after pre judging and then all of a sudden you know at the night show We saw that we see Justin winning or not winning but you know get actually getting a first place vote but Facing second Yeah Justin made Massage Improvements He actually was one point Chris off of off of winning the in at the night show he was one point by the end I I had him Second in pre judging and Probably first or second in the night show Now he looks like like a victim Martinez here doesn't he he's starting to get that even hit some of the same Victor twisting poses, you know in that front double by Yeah, I mean he he's got a small waist he's extremely wide Got a great The P L T Conditioned Oh or him like best condition head to toe Probably him in the show So that loan okay, right when you talk about body building Talk about either But you talk about condition or you talk about incredible flow with condition that needs for size I mean, so I mean he had a prerequisite to win the show which was the condition and decides Right, where is legs a little behind the upper body in your estimation Always are they always are but you know what look at the lineup he's in do you got people that that condition right there Just smoking a lot of people in the top first call out put the put in act double against that People say all shows the one from the back Right, no you're right I mean I was very I was very impressed with him because I thought when Hassan came out you know I thought okay Hassan is tied enough to win it. You know he's not peeled But he's got that high green tons of muscle when you flex it things go crazy. Yeah, and when just came out I said oh You know, I guess what they're gonna contrast here is true conditioning with size against mammoth size and fake not fake conditioning, but you know In fair conditioning Hassan compared to let's say Justin Before we get to Hassan let let's talk about John Delorosa who some people thought he was winning after pre-judging or at least he was in second place You know he's got a very balanced physique when I did my assessment of the new Pro you know a couple days ago before the show I said here's the guy who's one probably more approach Was then anyone in the lineup He's got really no flaws to his physique in the sense that he's not missing anybody If I he doesn't have it spectacular about it, but everything flows well When is he in shape he's dangerous because he wins shows because he's so balanced What was your assessment of on a one to ten scale of of all the John Delorosa's we've seen from one to ten Tenming the best which John Delorosa did we see too 6.5 for 6.5 Okay, so you're like You're saying this is not even anywhere near his best No, it's not tight enough Okay, and when you say tight enough I mean is he flat here or is he just not conditioned enough His body counts too high Okay He doesn't look like he's holding down much fatty, but he's he's got to accept the physique because he holds on to his weight really well You know, I find What would you have What's that? I mean he's got lute here. I mean in the perspective He don't have the right glove. He's got the left glove Right, right no you're right You're that's why I'm laughing you're right I'm gonna show the picture right there people go well I have two body bills why I helped you like and they both from Chicago and they said I can't get my right glue my right glue for some reason doesn't strike I said no that's because you're right Book has fat on it So you could you can have one glue having my fat and one doesn't okay This this picture is a good I mean I know the lighting's not the best, but There's not a lot of back detail there. John's had more back detail than that Yeah, is that because he's flat or is it because he's not lean? I don't see it any fat on his body really that much it just seems like he's like very like nothing's popping though Like no, maybe I mean Yeah, I mean He He was flat in the in the show and I mean he was he was not tied enough and I think that Probably was from being flat in the show I think so I don't think he really because you know you can tell when John's not in shape because his face is like he's got the big round face But he's he's pretty lean is face here you know at least for what I'm looking at Right, I mean let's look at his face His face is pretty pretty lean, you know So kind of well you look that's good news for John anyway because at least he knows he can correct this now You think we'll see John next week at in California? No You don't okay no What are you thinking is going to what you think he'll do Chicago? Which is brilliant Atlanta this year? Yeah, I mean he might do I don't know it's just total guessing but you know Yeah, he probably thought free judge and he's going to be in first and he didn't end up in seconds Right, I'm You always have to have those contingency plans, you know because these guys all want to be a limpia Yeah, it's one surprise Chris they didn't make a top three goes to the limpia Especially since they have this you know the stain show coming up they're going to give top three a limpia qualification really old All free these guys should you know gotten you know invites I thank you I'm looking Do anything I don't know you gotta have people in the lineup though, John Chris Don't try to be a limpia There's no call like I mean there are qualified people because you know you gotta get some more people into the white Let's talk about his on the side obviously we know you work with him so you of course you're biased But but at the same time let's talk about the narratives of his physique and and then what you would like to see improved Are you talking over me that much or is my microphone working? I'm I hear you but I'm trying to give you my I may be not hearing me I'm trying to just give you a assessment of of what the situation is that I want it Then I want then you can answer my questions what was Great about Hassan what was it could have been better Great about him was the biggest guy in the lineup by a lot great about him was a By far the best side tricep probably the best side chess probably the best back double after jett or maybe Justin's Most musculars just notki socks off cross-straded quads not quite lean enough Okay, so you feel that he could have been tighter. Okay, that's that's honest. Yeah, let's look at that side chest for a minute. Hold on Subscribe side chest not many guys. No, I had a side chest like that full packs you know big arms decent enough you know hamstrins from the side We see better than we always compare them for Paul the mail, you know because he looks a little like him we see better than Paul the mail Do you think Paul looked like that video I sent you? No, Paul was afraid you know Yeah, but this guy's different level Okay, this guy's a real deal Do you think that the judges look he definitely moved he moved up at night? I mean in the finals He wasn't in the top four at the end of pre-judging and now he finishes in fourth year so The judges definitely rewarded something that maybe they missed at the pre-judging Do you think that he could have that the reason maybe he didn't win the show was because he wasn't at his best by your own admission That's just this is his best by far It's his best by far, but it's we know that he can be tighter than this you know he can be tighter than this Okay, even though he I know you're saying you're saying you you think he's You know how this works conditioning win show so if he's not 100% Condition maybe the judges are not don't want to reward something that they feel is not Perfect yet We've seen it with other very good competitors that they've held them to a higher standard and didn't let them win shows Flex Wheeler was a guy that they made really bring his best to that USA before they ever gave him that Victor you know outside of outside of just in I mean he's harder than and and he's harder than and Delorosa by a lot by a lot Keep if you're not keep flowing through the pictures. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna give you a Back double bless that thing He feels as he feels like Jason low out of his mind. No Is he hard enough for the monumental amount of size that he has absolutely yes? It's how they bodybuilding context But you know And vibe People who are You know either gigantic or like black-doubt condition I think this was a I think the pre-after pre-genie was it was a Travesty that he was not in the top four I'll give you that I think that the the reason he did win the show was because he wasn't his best and and like like yeah I mean you even said Justin Rodriguez you know in your estimation was probably back there right Because of his condition Condition Right Justin Rodriguez had the best condition Right, so but I you know you and I know conditioning win shows. I mean we see it all the time That a surprise show How's that but how's that put that back in condition compared to ants? I don't I don't I don't I can't explain it Do you think that Eam got got a gift is that what you're saying because of you know that the second place it in the hind hunter and in Tampa two week or three weeks ago I would not have in first place so You know I think from a purest bodybuilding standpoint in terms of muscles La blah blah blah blah blah guys condition shape flow I thought it would go down to the wire to Hassan and Justin and And I Be surprised because Justin was you know very very condition That you know people are in the panel who are making the real decision not just for an outer pinions like me We would say like you know I love the condition and just it for Yeah, yes your sons like her sons Yeah, most muscle sure Well, I don't think just Dave Dave does Delorosa or or and yes, no look like that No, they've had different physics look I think that has this is my sense look I'll give you my assessment I'll give you my assessment my assessment I wasn't there Was that I think of anyone in the top five I think who's Thomas suffer has got the most Well, I shouldn't say has got some of the best potential of Anyone that lineup to go to the Olympia and be of Olympia contender Okay Because he's got the muscle size He's got the crazy you know separation in the muscle He's got the flow to his body. He doesn't have any gaps. He really has no weaknesses But I think that like this might I believe that They're holding them to a higher standard because of that because they feel that he could have been later and if he brings that level leanness to the next show I think what he said is you're gonna do california next week The is that thing ago And if he break comes in You know a couple pounds lighter. I mean he should blow the line up away don't you think I'm sure you get a torch room. I'm sure you get a torch room for a week, right? You know Best again Well, you're gonna put them I'm sure you can do cardio and low carbum and everything like that and I'm sure That's what they want to see they want to see tight, right? Yeah, I'm just playing like I'm just trying to be explicit about the idea like when you look at that on shot And look at the peckstrations and the crustaceans and the quads I'm saying okay Where is Deloroses you can't say they have different physics because one How son's twice a size of Delorosa and he's twice a size of Ian So it feels guys don't even have of the detail that he has Explain you explain to me other than oh they want to see him like feel like feel he Just to get to the Olympia to get to the Olympia Well, they know there's another show next week. They know we're gonna see him again If he comes in better next week and he destroys everyone He'll be the talk of the town he'll be the He'll be the guy that everyone's talking about going into the Olympia is the guy that you know who can Really mess with the top five someone that we were waiting to show up and and shock everyone, right? I mean That adds another level of excitement as far as I'm concerned You know That's how I think they're seeing it, you know, so we'll see what happens. Let's let's talk about max trials Because Max brought a really good look to the stage. I know he's working with me a lot now and I know Milus is Was very adamant about the fact that he felt he should have been higher. What what was Milus saying did Milus think match in a one I think he thought he should have been I don't know if he thought he should have won but he was really upset that At the placing they got You know in these Max has got a most muscular and a sight just an an ab shot and hands on hips most muscular deaths Beyond fabulous Superdense super-striated Of course the knock against him is like separation hamstring detail back the hill so You have to play if you're judging what a max of weaknesses versus deliroses weaknesses You know someone else is because Because they everyone has weakness this line up His max from behind and he's seen him yeah, I mean max is certainly not harder than Anyone from behind yeah, I mean in terms of like I would please He's just to put he's just tied his value or put him in back down Yeah, I think they're all you know you can you can say a value air max you can say a son they're all pretty no one really was like dry Chris except for the Justin Rodriguez right? True, I'm totally hundred percent Absolutely, so they were everywhere and I think that's where you're and then I understand where your frustration is your frustration It's like well no one was really that hard so like you know why is his son being held to a higher standard right Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean You're not going to get up against you know how he chopin Now and also it's bite by my my theory if if Conditioning when shows you're saying well then why didn't Justin Rodriguez win the show Right, I mean that's a point is like I can always just You know Period I agree with that if condition and win shows you you know then Justin should have won and just and should have won right and let's Unless too small and Justin had Added a lot of muscle so you could make the argument that He's big enough and you can clearly make the argument that he's you know peeled enough In the realm that condition win shows that he was the one or the show That makes sense Yeah, no you he wasn't press it. Let's let's talk about Patrick more who is in the top four after pre judging a lot of people said out It's guys top four and then he winds up out of the top five and it pretty after pre judging what what happens with him? Let's let's pull a picture him obviously work with him as well. So it's it's tough, you know You know you it's like your competitors swapped places, you know almost after pre judging What's the what's the what's the greatness and what's the not so great? about Patrick more in the show Super conditioned head to toe Yeah Super conditioned just needs more muscle Civil as a yeah And you know it did the weird if you look at comparison shots with him and people you know I goes right to him In terms of flow shape condition In many cases, you know if you pull up a comparison like a side right stuff or side chat You know he's got lots of bells and whistles. He's got the camp frame from the side the glutes and hands crazy ab explorations He's got glutes but Yeah Real glutes not just you know So you're saying more and I agree with you. I think he just needs more size Was that was it a mistake? I To after the Arnold we said the same thing we said we said Patrick needs more size Was it a mistake for him to maybe to compete again or you know And see get that kind of physique that doesn't matter he grows into his you know shows Because he's not he's not pushing the envelope, you know and That mean He can grow you know the irony is that he can grow you know I mean So what is he in his your now see shut it down for the rest of the year Chris Hell next week and then after calville probably take the r-off Okay, he's not really Have a hat is when he went from the first New York pro he did where he got 13th to jump to the winning the cal pro the next year Yeah Yeah Who in this light of do you feel that was not what? In terms of condition him and Justin Rodriguez with the two who were you know quote the most condition You know, they weren't any lacking body parts They were in terms of condition. You know some people have like all the peel from the front and soft from behind Or from behind the little soft They weren't tremendous shape those two When you uh look at this right When you look at this shell as a whole How would you rate it on one to ten? I mean it was a good show just because I'm critical of the like the you know people in the show Doesn't mean it wasn't a great show I mean that You know the ups You know and but value still very good body bill they're died Delores a very good body bill max Charles is a very good body bill there and and the list after people who did make tops Sixth people outside the effort either good body bill is potentially really good body bill So I mean it was it was a Competitive it was more competitive than two weeks ago and damn for five weeks ago whenever the You know more yep Yeah, I want to bring up one more name a Phil Klohaar who I worked with You know was fourth and Tampa a couple weeks ago Brunnan I thought what was a much better look here in New York To New York pro and he winds up in tenth He was actually looking he was lowered the net after pre judging and he moved up but Let's pull this picture Was he overlooked Yeah, he was all looked big he was all looked out he's big and he's hard and he's legit hard He's not like you know He was in very good shape let me see if that picture justifies it Yeah, it does justify look at the shoulders arms pecks and abs on that I mean that's He was very impressive Yeah, I was very surprised and he but I know he was very upset with with the way placed and that you know I talked them there. I'm a great guy to give someone like a like a consolation speech like And tell don't don't don't get too upset about it and come back better because you know I've experienced some a lot of Poor placing is in my time, but maybe I didn't deserve some I probably did but some I didn't and so you know I could I had to take it on the chin and you know if that's what bodybuilding's all about right? I mean sometimes you you do great and it comes out and you're you're happy with the placing and sometimes You know it just doesn't Somehow you missed I don't know in the lineup. I don't know why you know maybe wasn't known I don't know not at much of the household name It happens though it really happens He's very This is all time best I thought yeah, yeah, I thought it was to it work really hard I mean really hard and you know it was it he's another guy who it's very hard to get that balance between Fullness and conditioning with him and I really thought we we nailed it pretty well here So you know he's gonna he's gonna come back better and better He's gonna keep improving and we'll see him again. I think in Chicago, which is really Atlanta That show and hopefully maybe he'll get a bit he'll get some more love at that show but I I's nuts, you know when you get overlooked you get more attention You know brought to you Then when you warrant and so then the judges are ready to see you the next time they see you They're like oh, that's the guy that we we maybe we over look Let's take a better look at him and a lot of times those guys will move up and actually become future names, you know in the in the lineup so It happens He's like Early like maybe 40 or some of that Like 30 spring chick yeah, he's not he's not like he's not like in his 20s or anybody's You can't tell because he got that age of space, you know He's gonna have one right one space Trick and he should continue to compete and all the shows for the last of the year of the show Yeah, he's got a definitely do Chicago so I know that that's I don't know what's I don't think California is on the on the table but definitely Chicago is It's expensive to go to these shows too, Chris, you know it's it's not like It's $100 to watch pre-judging finals from the back You did Really Should I I didn't even know you were going should it tell me what I do you would have a press best General's mission Let's let's talk about the the 2012 were you impressed with Bol Luis the one Yeah, he's really good Yeah, thick Really really good side chas really good side tricep um I think he was tighter he was better five weeks ago when George Peterson beat him Right and and to some degree he was He He could have walked away in second place here too. I mean Jason low came in just Inside out upside down jizzled and hardcore What what makes Bol Luis's physique Impressive to you like obviously the you know the judges like the piece though I super super appealing looking side tricep inside chest um He just looks really round ball guy on the those two shots His back Double is pretty darn complete. I think it looked more complete because it might have been a little bit leaner five weeks ago when he Book tremendous also When he was second to George Peterson He doesn't really have weaknesses He could stand with the vacuum in the lineup which is impressive Yeah, his most muscular he his arms look gargantuan He's just he's got real dense looking muscle you know what I mean And And he's he's got you know he's got the lat he's he's in condition Right He now he was impressive. I was very impressed with him And you know I think that you know he's he's gonna be a guy that's gonna get better and better and you know He's like he's like a workhorse to that guy. You know I call the the workhorse guys It's just like you know just keep plugging away plugging away plugging away I mean and He's still there you know. Let's talk about your guy Jason low moving up from classic Which is you know not an easy thing to do to the two 12 division something that we only really we heard a lot of George Peterson we heard about Key on Pearson doing it Jason low is like always on the quiet we don't really hear much about him and then he shows up at a show and he impresses the hell out of people Talk to me about the decision to move The you know the decision was moved to move was made Probably think Two or three years ago. I think when he did the Arnold and I've been coming to my hotel room and and who's doing classic day, right Right and it was days to cover the glutes Right and blutes and ham from nuts and let's go that's too bad And then you know he's doing classic but I had him ticked all the like oh hit a most most kiss and they're on Master most most kiss so well he does anybody like I'm gonna hit it anyway Yeah, you know or I'd say Hit a side try stuff they don't ask for side try stuff. I know I know but I want So um You know that's that the That's the way that wacky shot He want to give power that I'm done in the open he would have won to open and that with the if conditioning rise on that one Yeah, that looks like and he fell Put that up next the hands back Crazy he Jason low is one of these guys that like you don't think he has the genetics to do it and then as he's gotten bigger His his physique has gotten like better. I think Sometimes guys I think they classic is the way to go because it is only you can make the way but sometimes people just look better bigger you know Yeah, he does yeah He looks better bigger He was inspired by and so the classic journey for him Dave the interesting story The back half of that is he came to the Arnold's one time and He was doing the Arnold classic and the the classic division And he was just Chisel that he was in my hotel room and he was so chisel to make the way like like this, you know and Raphael Vrandeo was there and Luke Sandout was there and I was there and we watching him pose and we he was put on we were just memorised by the detail Yeah, and He looks at like something funny like you know Screw that clap, you know he encouraged him to do you know to do the show That's cool. Yeah, I guess they became I don't know if he became really tight, but I know they became very friendly And it was Luke who drove him you know that the end to Abandoned classic and say you know you know and guy because if you if you look at his Instagram, it's I pb I'm just quite broke who I told I told Jason Jason I watch all your workouts. I mean I don't watch all of them, but They're like here I am diving and doing 140 dumbbells, you know, he's very strong. He's very hard to work That's a strong looking physique right there You could tell he trains heavy. Yeah, he's got a rugged physique for sure for sure now You know congratulations him. I think I love to see him on an Olympia stage again So guys, I think he can really hold it on a get some let's talk about let's talk about classic physique though because We had another jump Logan Franklin who was a men's physique guy for years Made the jump to classic in the any one no and I always tend to be pictures and I and I've no Watching his progress and I'm like this guy looks really good took him but it's good two years to really grow into this class But and he know he told me he was gonna make the jump and this was gonna be the big year Obviously got the ladle on the business of the whole COVID thing, but I mean he he really is I mean from this is the first man's physique guy That I really so jump make the elevator make that jump and not only just jump but make a successful jump Get no heat he he looks good. He's he's like I To move out minute and I start on stage. I said oh he's like the Chris from step b version You know, I mean that His legs aren't quite as good as bomb status details don't as good but it's structurally that similar, right? Well, he's improving. It's like he's making his improvements as you know in front of our eyes because He he's a perfect example of like a guy who is a young young guy who didn't have the muscle to to be A bodybuilder yet so he went into into men's physique and then he didn't but and then when the class came out He wasn't really yet ready for that but then he grew into that now he's a class again We yeah, I can I don't I can fully expect possibly to see him as if as an open bodybuild at some point. He's he's very driven in that sense He might not just stay here Look at that shot first right. Look at that Arnold shot Yeah, let me say a great shot That three quarters back. Yeah, he looks good. Look at the glue. He's good. He looks fresh Right, fresh muscle after we can class it can be already burnt out on stuff But in classic and you're doomed Yeah But I'm just saying look I mean that's a great great. I mean he he knows how to position his body. He's you know He looks like a seasoned guy. He's been bodybuilding his whole life. You know, and that's You don't see that that are often so I think you know he's look I like when I see guys that are gonna add fresh I guess you could say blood to the the divisions the new divisions you know and so I'm I'm excited to see him on stage. How does he do against to bring on an ansley and and Chris bumps that and those guys I mean can he hold his own anything You know I think I think Not quite yet. You know what I mean this is something in terms of You know to me to me he looks okay, if he looks like a very good classic bodybuilder which he is Yeah, and bumps that pass As a regular bodybuilder. So that's where I know he's saying yeah, I don't get something he's there He's at another level. Yeah, he's at the level of the same thing with Briona you know Briona could pass us a brick 12 guy and that goes for same thing with George Peter somebody was in the classic You know, I mean I always said on this show like well, he's not really classic at all Yeah, you know he's bodybuilder So I think Logan has like Traditional like golden age Classic lines, but if he had to stand between bumps dead in Briona. I think they have muscle maturity And they're they're actual density would Sure, you know, I was exposed what he doesn't have yet Yeah No, I agree I agree I wanted to bring up I don't know if you watch the whole is you watch the whole show Yeah I watched I watched the 2012 and the I think it girls Of course not Nicole Graham I got I got a pull a picture of I'm really really impressed with that But since you're probably gonna see around safe. So let's see you'll see you're here how good a shade These figure I'll just keep getting dead or and better and better What a great what a great look there I think she's gonna be super dangerous that the at one be a this year She's looking at the canvas Lewis yep Crazy I Can't see I actually see she's actually hitting poses here Did she see this I'll look at which I thought she was a woman's physique better first because she's got such a great physique Look at this look at this I'm looking at the pictures on the NPC news online look at this shot With the heels on Chris She can take women's physique yeah, right if you wanted to I'll find his that Yeah, she she's got the luck She can she can definitely be due crossover if she wanted to with one point Chases never yeah, yeah, I like I like when people have fun with it That was great so she she won figure the raining miss Olympia The Tila Santiago she won the bikini pop a picture of her cute for a little love It's always cool when you see it like a miss Olympia or miss her Mr. Olympia like a better in a right in like a New York pro show like a regular show Isn't it just it's great for the fans you know the fans actually did It's sometimes it's such that these fans only get to see these Olympia champs at the At the what's the look all the Olympia now they can she actually comes in doesn't near crush is no reason to have to do that Except the Odyssey using is a warm up and that's great you know and glad that they some people are not afraid to put the Put it on a line I ran into London Murray there I heard she was there. Yeah, what what did she did you talk to? Yeah, I said, Linda I said, you know you want to be only persons I said you the most when people see you you were one of the You must get all the time the same question which you might find a fan service like Either how old do you now because she looks so good for her yeah, whatever that is she can be caused the 60 right Yeah 58 I know she was close to 60 I knew it she's amazing she doesn't age she's like Linda Wood White remember Linda Wood White Linda Wood White was the youngest looking 70 year old You know Right she's wait until she turns 80 she'll still look for she'll look the same she doesn't age then you at all Let's talk about Well You broke up the opposite sorry Let's talk about Ari Sithia who won the men's physique Did you see him yeah We press Yeah, you are okay Yeah, very impressive well deserved Yeah, it's about deserved you know I mean it's it's funny those That class usually goes to like I mean if you're in Strictacular you know the best condition usually come on on top I think this is like he announced he this is the fifth time he's gone to the Olympics qualified for Yeah, he's always in there he's always in there he's very consistent I am always reporting on him on a muscle morning to He gave a very good genuine genuine Speech about making it back to the Olympia you know people like it from microphone and the faces Yeah, you know, I would like to thank my sponsors and my parents and all my turn You know, it was just pretty much for Well, that he came out the winner and it came across a little speech which I don't think he was prepared to give and you know Tark Being excited to go back to the Olympic this time in the fact that you know this idea that You know he's no genetic freaking his mind that he just worked work work work work work is made it When to show every yet to get to the Olympia and it just expands the idea like you know if I can conquistelf doubt and A accomplish a goal like this with my body to make it to Olympia then I can accomplish anything it was a really Excellent impromptu speech which made it you know impressive Rather than some pre-planned packaged Right It's nice when people can you know Our appreciative of where you know where they are, do you think? I guess that's the best way to put it Great way, put it. He knows he's a totally aware of the idea that I just won the show I'm going back to the Olympia people don't get to do that. It's a huge accomplishment You know at the same time, you know come come across not We come come across Appreciate it because not because it sounds good but because you actually are it was a great speech He probably don't think so I'm glad you did that that's important right I'm glad you do Let's talk about women's bodybuilding which they added to this event Milo Ash winning that we can pretty spectacular Yep, I see that I you know I was trying to figure out what happened with New York Pro obviously Steve Weinberg usually holds the New York Pro Up in New York obviously New York was was a no go so they moved it to Tampa which look like it looks like Tim Gardner took it over almost you know It was like almost like Weinberg passed it off to them. I don't know if that's the case or not Steve wasn't there. I know that probably you didn't want to travel. I don't blame him and Sometimes him got you know wings of strength involved with that with the event and they added women's bodybuilding Obviously which is good because they need qualifiers. They need to qualify somebody's women for the Olympia obviously so Milo wins here she qualifies For the Olympia obviously I like to see you know Ravansy like like someone win by default She's she's really good. I think it's a good representative of the of some more good together in a Olympia stage. You know come December I agree with you. She's got Good shape which I spoke to Lander ironically about vote, you know the change in the shift bodies and female bodybuilding compared to 25 But she has good good flow good shape and I think that's a huge prerequisite for You know being doing really good in these winning these pro shows including going to the left So you want to have a You want to have people off there with good shape. Yeah, and let's the finish it off with Rachel Adams who won the arrangement of Rachel Daniels excuse me who won the women's physique and I I live in the like her physique to she is really Pretty peels Who would a one in a contest between Rachel Daniels and Milo Ash What do you think I don't know you tell me I wasn't there Would have been close right Yeah, what have I closed Somebody like I'm you know I'm trying to I'm trying to lay down my case for combining divisions I'm never gonna let off that you know I they'll never do it, but I keep putting it out there and saying just combine them combine them combine them combine I'm cold Miss Olympian women's physique division Brand champion Miss Olympia put them together Just do it guys Those Yeah, well, you know We're we're kind of running out of time and I know you're running out of steam so we're not gonna We're not gonna we're gonna do another show on the North American championships Maybe you and I'll do a show during the week and analysis of a breakdown in that We'll look at the pictures we'll pull up some videos stuff again. It was such a humongous show Gary you did had broke the bank on this one and I don't know how he did it He told me himself because I didn't think there was gonna be a big turnout I think they got a big a turnout that they never got and I think there was over 1500 people there Chris Competing this week. I think there was like 600 bikini competitors alone You believe that I can believe that and real Who said by building it who said that did that you know the no one's competing? Obviously with all the gyms that were closed Chris for like six months It's amazing how many people were able to find the place to work out Refresh Yeah, I tell you the resourcefulness of people in train right we're crazy We'll find the place anywhere to try Yeah everyone I know found a place to train with there's an exception of maybe three three of four people who Move to a transition from a commercial jam to building your own Jims and they are garages and they ended up you know Garages to the extent that they say god. This is great. I'm never gone back to each Jim You know, Chris I love the idea of going to the gym when I was when I was competing But the truth is if I was let's say you and I we're in the era right now this cold I mean I would have spent every nickel I had to build the best Jim in You know in my house that I could possibly do Because it was that important to me, you know at the time it was like I wasn't saving money for like to buy a house I was the body building was way more important than I would have spent every penny you know To get the equipment I needed and you know when I would have bought all freeway stuff at the time because I didn't care about machines You know you don't really need machines machines or a luxury item don't you think Of course, if you have a power apple you have a bench you can do everything right? Yeah, yeah, you know what I always say You can with a flat bench and a bar and a couple sets of dumbbells You can train all the body parts if you create them yeah, look I see these guys in jail training The the resourcefulness of what they do there and and these guys have unbelievable physics When people cry to me that they don't have a you know a cable crossover machine You don't have a hammer shins chest machine. I laugh Right We spoiled this oil this oil now. That's the truth Look if you're a body builder in today's world With viruses closing stuff down and now you know that they they will quarantine and close gyms You better have backup in your house you better you better get a set of heavy heavy bar bells and dumbbells and having this backup because You know unless you have someone who owns you know someone owns a gym Because otherwise you're gonna be you're gonna be screwed the royal one and if too risky if you're a top level body, you gotta have access All right Chris, what do you even need tomorrow morning and a few hours maybe use it see it's one by the parents six thirty Have you noticed that the travel was easier or harder with this go home COVID thing going on Oh, it was easier but you leave the airport David you get on a plane packed with people Really, it's it's not funny Sold out But it's I so there's no separation and there's no there's no six feet separation on plane You Who it is now now?
