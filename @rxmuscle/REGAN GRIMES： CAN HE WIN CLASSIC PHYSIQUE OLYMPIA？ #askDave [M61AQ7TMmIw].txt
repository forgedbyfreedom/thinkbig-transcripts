Alright, television on rxmuscle.com. This is astave, better known as hashtag astave. I'm your host of the FurogiVis. Is your 30 minute question and answer show with Dave Plumbo? All your questions on diet, training, supplementation, IFV, pros, competitions, life, whatever it is on your mind. It is all on the table. If we now bring in Dave Plumbo, Dave, a couple of days ago you did an interview with an Iranian bodybuilder, last week you did the rent about getting hotny chupin and 2v1, hotny chupin of course, lint you qualified but unable to get his visa to enter the United States. A very very telling interview with another rising star coming out of Iran right now in our rxmuscle.com. Yeah, Baru's Tabani is tremendous talent this guy and he's in the military now because I guess you know like Israel, Iran you have to serve 2 years in your country. If you go right to college out of high school then you can get a way within delay a little bit but he's now in the military for 2 years but he'll be done soon. Problem is Iran won't even let people out of their country anymore. So it's terrible when the political climate really dictates to the athletes what they can and can't do and you become almost like a victim of that but this guy is another 26 years old. I can't even believe the talent cool will see coming out of Iran with the bodybuilders but it's I got to give King Kamali credit because he predicted it. He said there's a bunch of guys running around there that you're not going to believe how good they are and he was right. He really is so I'm impressed whether they actually if we can break this cold war we have going on and allow the athletes to start crossing out of the country and coming to the United States to compete. I think it could change the landscape of a bodybuilding really. So again that interview live with Barruz Tabani right now at rxmusubah kam and the YouTube channel. Let's go to the questions. Our first two questions from the Dave Palombo experience at the first question from Melanie what do you think about T-ball for females and how would you don't sit? Here's the problem with T-ball back in the 50s when they developed steroids and all the East German women because back then Germany was split East Germany, West Germany. West Germany was like the United States type of government and East Germany was like Russia and Soviet Union and East German women were given a tyrannable which was T-ball. They created it so they haven't had an advantage and all the East German women look like East German men they couldn't tell the difference because they got so many side effects from T-ball because it was really just a cut rate diatable. T-ball is a very similar in their fact a diatable stronger but T-Ratable has got plenty of side effects to go along with it as well. Once again I'm not thrilled with with with with oral but in general but for women it's way too strong you will get a lot of side effects and here's the problem and I've said this before in the show side effects with women are not instantaneous because steroids don't act instantaneously they're cumulative. You could do four weeks of T-ball and you might not notice the side effects they're there believe me and they will come out even if you stop it after four weeks you will still see it continue. You cannot use this drug it's too strong for women to use it's unnecessary. Winstrel and anovar are fine to get the gains that you want as a woman. There's no massive bodybuilders anymore so it's not like women have to compete with all these huge women in the bodybuilding world. So you know the only reason why a woman would want to use a strong drug like that was because they're lazy and they don't want to work for a couple years to get where they need to be but I'll tell you something. If you can get the physique that you want and still have a beautiful face in that ruin your body and not ruin yourself with side effects that's the winning combination. Second question again from the Dave Palombo Experience app it's from Chris Dave I want to add some oral wind straw and anovar to my current TRT to increase things just a touch. Would you do them both at the same time or six weeks of one and six weeks of the other and at what dose do you suggest? If you're combining them with testosterone yeah you might as well just do one in one this way you have something to switch to you can even do eight weeks of each of you wanted to. They're both fast acting so it doesn't matter which one you start with. Winchels a little stronger some 80 start with the anovar 30 milligrams per day with your testosterone TRT and then you know do eight weeks of that and then another eight weeks of maybe like 25 milligrams of a winch stroke per day with your TRT testosterone that would be fine. Let's go to our Instagram questions again you can follow us at official.rxmuscle is going to make no lea monster I hate to show more. He's so much at rather sit through a kind green epiphany. Dave can you clarify the true difference in results from pharmacy grade H8 versus UGL generic HGH a lot of guys don't have the money for pharma but a lot of pros say you literally burning your cash behind genetics what are your thoughts. Here's the problem the thoughts are that you don't know what you're getting okay when you're buying a generic it could be it could be fully just look I've seen generics okay that that were probably higher dose than what they should be and I think we've discussed this a lot of people and I think what's happening is I don't think the Chinese people are putting out fake GH. I think what's happening is when it's being shipped over here it's not in a uh, a climate controlled environment and a lot of times if it gets really hot or even too cold because if GH is frozen it will destroy it it weakens it or and or kills it off. So I think a lot of these these products are actually good when they leave the factory and China but then when they get to the United States they're really not that functional. Back in the day when we would transport GH everything was on ice okay when we bought it when we you know it took it home when we moved it more you know it gave it to other people it was on ice all the time always climb a control we didn't that that was just the thing you did it was GH had to be refrigerated you know now I understand that some of the new ones like serostam some of them don't need to be refrigerated till the mix but that also means they that's only if you keep them at room temperature that doesn't mean you can heat it up to 90 degrees or bring it down to zero degrees so I think that's what the problem is most of the time when you're bringing over stuff from another country it's the climate control issues. Now there might be some other deceptive you know type of manufacturing going on as well what we do know is if you're getting American-made GH that's coming from you know from a pharmacy you know it's good you know that's the bottom line you know that that's good and that and that's why it's it's safe for the use and that's why I tell people if you could if you have access to something that's pharmacy grade you're better off taking that and using a lower dosage to this because there it might be more expensive than taking a large dosage of stuff that you don't even know what you're putting into your body so you know you could take two or three I use of serostam a day make each little bottle last year you know a week and you got seven weeks in a box I mean that that's even if you pay me seven hundred dollars for a box that's still pretty damn cheap you know considering you know that you're getting high potent CGH and you're gonna get we're good results because that's what I did back in the day three I used a day in some maybe four I used of of a new trope and that that was enough that's all people did and they got great results because the growth home on was real and it was full potency and I think that's where where people have issues. Carlston iron burner Dave did you ever take blood tonic during your bodybuilding career and it's so why blood tonic I don't even know what that is to be honest you know I always say I don't know something I don't know and I don't know I have to google it it might be a term for something that I do know but I never heard of the term blood is something let me throw something out there what if you meant by a blood purifier I don't even know what that would mean you know I don't I don't know I don't know what blood never heard the term before to be honest with you blood tonic it's going to be another question why something to clean the blood I don't I don't know I don't even know what to say I'm stopping. We'll take another question from Rob M.T.03 how do you feel about today's top classic physical predators as real in relation to the 80s physique such as the Bob Paris Variety or any one that has the classic look or rather the part B of the question is has the classic look advanced with modern times. I like the I like some of the classic physique as I think they're they're awesome but I like the classic physique guys that looked like more like you know bodybuilders almost that are more complete a lot of these classic guys are just guys that are kind of starting out and they just don't have enough muscle yet and so while they have nice lines I see gaps in their physique and I have a feeling a lot of those guys that are pros now once they do fill out the physics will go to the open category maybe even to 12th category but there are some guys that have really very you know like Breon and Ashley the reason I think he's such a good classic guy is that he has a complete physique with with mature muscle with no gaps in his physique and here's a guy who doesn't need to add any more muscle necessarily to his frame whereas there's a lot of guys like even I see a Chris Bumset he's got a great physique but there's a guy who could actually put on 20 pounds onto his physique and probably compete in the open if he if he wanted to so you know it they're different types of physics at that I think the great thing about the classic division is that you're always seeing a new talent come into it and it's like seems like there's always some guy with crazy or genetics in the neck so it's a division where you can make an impact right away because you don't have to put on a hundred pounds of muscle before you do whereas for body going to get a new guy to come in and and all of a sudden wow that the body building world it takes a long time for that and so we don't see as many of that but it seems to be classic every year we get two or three new guys that will like holy macawid this guy come from and that that's exciting for the sport. Matt Tracy Dave I'm getting gyna surgery soon what kind of diet do you recommend while in recovery? I think I would eat the normal food feed obviously before you get surgery you can't take any nutritional supplements two weeks before the surgery because a lot of them like fish oils and vitamin E will cause excessive bleeding and have it's clotting factors which is good on a regular basis but not when you're getting blood vessels sniped and stuff like that so that's just my you know my my my beliefs I wouldn't purposely lower or change anything. If I keep it still training in the gym because your body still bleeding recovery from gyna surgeries like recovery from a workout you still need to give you body raw materials that needs to do that. Josh Freeman Dave there seems to be mixed answers on whether or not fenasteride can be taken while on Deca can you give me your opinion also what dosage would you recommend? Yeah I don't know what with this fenasteride and deca or in tremble on look I took it with it I didn't have any problems I don't know I don't I think I think sometimes you you start looking into the my new shirt of things and you you overlook what's really happening. I don't think there's any problem taking tremble on it should be taking fenasteride with Deca you're not gonna cause you know worse hair loss or worse prostate issues it's just not gonna happen. A good dosage of fenasteride is probably anywhere from one milligram per day to 2.5 milligrams. I've been taking 2.5 milligrams per day for years I started at one milligram and I didn't feel like I got that much someone else told me you know what 2.5 is the sweet spot. I went to 2.5 milligrams per day and I like I said I've been honest since about 2001 and I continue to say I think the only time I stopped was when I was trying to get my wife pregnant because we read that fenasteride was you know we'd make it hard to get her pregnant and I don't know if that helped or not but I went right back on it after she got pregnant so maybe I took off you know three four or five weeks or something like that so to me I like it I'll tell you why I use it for my hair loss I don't know if I don't think it regor any hair but I think it might have stopped my hair loss from in capony but I will tell you this my dad had prostate issues you know it's in his life and my prostate's not gonna wood it seems perfect but I don't know if my PSA is good my DHC levels are in in line which is weird because I'm not on any hormone replacement I take 2.5 milligrams per day of fenasteride and my DHC levels are still normal you know they're there low normal but they're not like too too low which tells you I probably naturally produce a lot of the H.C. which is probably I'm a good candidate for taking that so I think that's important to understand that you know not everyone needs fenasteride but if you do our prone to high D.H.C levels and that usually means if you if you lose hair easily if you have acne if you do have any prostate issues you might want to stay on it and I look at it this way even if I'm not growing one hair it's kidney product it excuse me it's prostate protective. Nate Flex Dave the love of your showed you feel that low test high antibiotics cycles can be effective just low doses in general for example 250 mg testosterone stipulated and 400 mg of decar and copoise weekly for 16 weeks. Look anything any steroid cycles gonna build muscle okay I'm sure if I took that type of cycle right now I probably put on 20 pounds of muscle because I my body would you know muscle memory however if you're looking to be really big and put on significant amounts of muscle mass you're not gonna do it on low doses just like that that's not to say you need to take the 5000 mg a week but there is a certain threshold amount that you need to take and I believe the sweet spot is about a thousand mg of testosterone a week and you could debate me out and that's fine but my point is that you know you're not going to grow one small dose of just to the maximum effect so it depends on what your goals are. We have a question on stand effortings a vertical diet just so you know we do have plans to have stand on next week Wednesday on live weight Dave I know I didn't tell you that but he's just a couple of hours ago so he is good to go to appear on live with next Wednesday let's go to panels Dave your thoughts on combining fats and carbs together in a meal non-heryl season is a theoretically wrong it's a true because both of them are energy sources one of them will be stored as fat. They're energy sources but they get used differently fats get used in slow sustained movements okay carbs get used for fast you know explosive type movements so you need both also fat is used to build and repair muscle to make hormones and all kinds of stuff that's why fats are necessary in the diet they're not just a fuel source if you combine them in the same meal it doesn't matter because carbs cause insulin release insulin stores carbs in the muscles is glycogen it stores carbs as fat it doesn't store fat as fat so that's a that's a misnomer so there's nothing wrong with eating protein fats and carbs all in the same meal obviously you're going to eat a higher amount of protein because that's what we really need fats will be a certain you know based on your your weight anywhere from 15 grams per meal to 25 30 grams per meal depending on how heavy you are and then carbs is depending on you know what your fuel requirements are so nothing wrong with that you don't have to separate your foods Damian T5 says he just bought fiber lies can I take my T3 or clan or nova decks before or after having fiber lies I would probably take it you know and then maybe like 20 minutes later do your fiber shade I don't like to take I don't like to mix fiber really with anything it really theoretically should only block fat absorptions or fat absorption like fat soluble type stuff but who knows I just separate my fiber shade from everything else I do if I can do it you know sometimes I'm in a rush and I take everything at once pills fiber run out of the house for the day but most of the time I try to separate them let's go to Noah the Fox Dave your take on the Barbell bench press Arnold and Franco loved it and have some of the best chest development ever now a lot of pros are saying it's too risky and to do incline only instead is the reward for the risk you know at some point I of my career like after a couple years I started doing mostly all incline work because I found that you know when you do incline presses you're still working in the lower mid and mid packs you're just prefer I guess you say prefer for actually working the upper packs and what I find in my experiences that most people 99.9% of body bills have weaker weak er doesn't mean they have weak chest weak er upper chest and mid chest and lower chest that's just the way it works so I always did mostly incline stuff once in a while maybe once a month I would fly bench press and it's just because I just felt that I got more out of my chest workouts when I was targeting incline work and when I say incline I mean I'm not at a big steep angle I'm probably almost it looks like you're almost flat just a little bit maybe 20 30 degrees I was bench pressing it and I thought it made a world of difference it's got a glenter dude best way to hit legs if you're lower back a screwed also thoughts on spinal surgeries you know it's a tough question to answer because I don't know how bad you are I always tell people to limit themselves by what you know your pain level is and what your body is intuitively telling you to do and not do I guess theoretically you can do hacksquads and leg presses and and build leg mass I just think without freeway squatting you lose that beautiful shape to your legs but then again some of it's genetic anyway so look you got to do what you can do I'm not happy that when I go to the gym I can't do the workouts I want because my one bed shoulder that's last that I have to get replaced is still there and it's inhibiting me but I still do what I can do in the gym because it makes me feel good to leave the gym to know I did something and at some point when I get this fixed I'll be on the start training again I'm not going to train like I'm training for the Olympia but I could certainly train heavier and I have to worry about pain on everything I do and I understand that it's frustrating but you know stick with what your body intuitively tells you shock sales guy question I recently watched Victor Conti Sunday we haven't heard in a while yeah on Joe Rogan's podcast and he spoke of the importance of zinc they could you speak to that end and was zinc included in a past video were you spoke of six vitamins which are an absolute must no I talked about six nutritional products I thought were a must I have to zinc in my V mineralized formula look let's face it you can't be taking every single mineral and vitamin and net trace metal separately you be on you have 400 bottles a day I created a multi vitamin multi mineral formula with some fruit and vegetable extracts and it called V mineralized which makes everything easy all the minerals accumulated including zinc it's in there in the right proportions and the right amounts you take five toes twice a day you don't even have to worry about it you got everything you possibly need and the only thing I tell people to take a little extra is extra vitamin D3 I think you can do another five thousand units to that they can never forget too much of that I only have two thousand units which is still very high dosage in my multi vitamin the promise if you put too much in there is no room for all the other stuff zinc is important but it's an important component in conjunction with the other minerals magnesium and calcium and iodide and you know and the list goes on chromium so you can't just say one thing is more important than everything else it's the combination of all of them together protein king 95 and of course wedding the appetite for those looking for Olympia coverage of course roughly seven and a half weeks away he wants to know how you think regained rhymes stacks up against the likes of crispumstead and brian angley I think regained is a tremendous talent I think his biggest obstacle is going to be making weight you know he's got a lot of weight to drop it's not going to be easy to keep doing that I predicted that this would be his last year doing this classic division I think he just snuck down into that last show he you know he's going to have a problem with it but I think that the bumps that is could win the Olympia this year I think him and it's going to be once again between him and brian angley and I think that it's going to come down right for the end and it's going to be who the judges like better because I think both of these guys are going to look great. Two O'Mass your thoughts on front loading a a s according to lollin and a box tenth edition the most effective dosage of test was 680 g for 6 to 8 weeks after which it starts to have diminishing returns is there really that much more benefit for us assigned effects on running one gram of test compared to 600 mg if one gram is more effective when is the right time for a bodybuilder to start using this amount example after five cycles or after he's big enough I think a thousand milligrams for his ideal for for test loss and usage and building maximal mass and thickness I didn't someone else my friend Doug Wenson told me that you got to do and it's time I think it was over my 500 milligrams when I got him like you short size so much today people laugh at that but I said all right I'll try it and you know I grew like it was that was the perfect magic dosage for me to use that I started seeing results and I didn't have massive side effects for me I just think it works you know I just think that you know anything less than you're going to get results but it should you not going to maximize your results and how you know when she just started that who knows after maybe two of three cycles I mean you can you can work up to that you'll know when you're at that stage we are not responding from the weaker drugs and it's time to go to test and you'll know that when you're on test a couple cycles you know it's not working so good maybe I should bump it up to a thousand milligrams a week at this point rather than sticking with 250 or 500 or 750 and I think you'll see a big difference I really do Dean Nicholson here's one this a little out of the bodybuilding realm but what gear would you recommend for an MMA fighter? It's very tough question because you guys get taught the UFC guys get tested I don't know if it's random or not but I know that they that I think it might be but they definitely get tested in competition you know if you any tested in competition it becomes an IQ test of knowing when to start and stop things I'm not going to go over it on this show it's too complicated you can you know do a consultation with me if you're in that arena but you know you have to understand that there are rules you know and if you're breaking the rules you're subject to there you know management and your fines that they're going to put in there so you know think about it what you want to do before you really go ahead and do it and make a stupid mistake now the answer to this question might be as simple as ISO bag but I imagine this is a scenario that many bodybuilders and aspiring bodybuilders go in a daily basis so we'll ask the question is from TJ the jet I drive a tractor trailer for a living so most of my meals will be on the road I bring my eyes lines with me but I would also like to have actual food as well but I have a hard time coming up with a good high protein meal because to pack it in a lunch and eat cold because most of the time I don't have a microwave I know I can just suck it up and have cold chicken rice or whatever but just curious if you have any ideas or something that is yummy that I get uh stay on track you're talking to the king of the cold food I highly cold pizza other refrigerator I love it but the bottom line is if you like warm food pack your meals and like you said like an ISO bag you know we sell the species ISO bags they're awesome you pack your meals and you know if you like them warm up like I have you know a couple of guys in my office at work they stick their food in the microwave warm and up and they eat their food I mean that's the best way to do it I mean you got to prepare if you don't prepare your meals and bring them you won't eat them and you'll eat junk food and that's not going to build muscle Courtney Thompson is Synthall the only answer for getting abs to grow to get what to grow calves now I mean you you could train them too obviously I mean that's probably the number one reason but I mean Synthall usage like Chris Clark's pain was pumped it's been Chris Clark's synthesized and my friends Steve Lucas pain was pumped product that I saw on daypleman with that convulton them they're great they'll definitely help you calves but you know train your calves that's really what's going to build them the biggest you know it's a combination I always felt that calves grew best if you did two sets twice a week and two sets of 15 with heavy enough weight to stimulate the muscle but when I find as if you do too many sets of calves over and over and over again what happens is you can't even feel the calves anymore you're fatiguing the bottom of your foot so much so that you can't contract with that much weight on your back any more and you're getting a crappy work done stop me if you ask this question recently but syrucious R.D. wants to know how long before it's show would you cut out growth hormone altogether for some clients I cut it out two weeks before for other people I never cut it out because they look really good on it so it depends if a guy is very watery and he's a little sloppy looking you know in terms of he just his body was became a water balloon for me from eating it from takes him from taking G.H. I'll have them stop two weeks out sometimes I might put it back in the last two days because it takes a lot more than two days to have side effects but it really is at once again it's a perfect person it's specific type of thing. Third degree muscle Dave on friends with coach Trevor from Enhance and he advised me to cut growth 10 to 14 days out my current coach wants me to cut it a seven days I'm worried if I cut it at 14 days and keep going 50 minutes of stairs that I'll burn muscle without the growth in there and shrink up the last two weeks your thoughts. Well if you're on an avocesterage you're not shrinking it all okay the steroids will preserve the muscle the question is how lean you are you getting to stand in front of it if you are then it's probably a good idea to stop it maybe put it back in like I said the last two days that's really up to you you got to be honest with yourself you look better you look worse with the G.H. A lot of guys look way better you fall around her and that's just the way it is so if I don't I think I've got what he said he's taking but if you cut back the two I use a day you should have no problems staying on. We had a question recently about uh rear delts actually no I'm going to skip that one my cool lives and then it's another classic physique related question how many grams of healthy fat is best per meal or per day based on classic physique frame six foot two two hundred and forty five pounds. I'm going to make you I'm going to make you job real easy go buy my own mega-lice formula take three pills three capsules jump caps twice a day twice a day and you never have to worry about another essential fatty acid ever it's all in there and the right dosages from fish oil coming from salmon oil or or avocado and trophy oil to um um oh evening primrose oil excuse me for your omega six fats obviously they're making three fats your DHA EPA coming for fish oils and then you got your palmetalagic acid omega seven fats which are really good for insulin sensitization and for lowering total body inflammation that's all you need you don't need anything else it takes the idea purposely to make it easy to take your your supplemental uh essential fatty acid supplements three pills twice a day and none. Mr. Miyagi or Mr. Yaki rather uh where is Victor Richards and what is he doing today? I interview him a number of years ago and I believe him I radio show he's still around I think he's living in Portland to something like that or Oregon somewhere he's happy he's got his kids I work that I try to get you know he's got a lot of very strong political stances but that's just always been Victor Richards I don't think he'll ever compete again he didn't really look like yeah much muscle left on his body but you know what if he's happy then hey that's great he was one of the freaky skies though back in the 90s forever fitness 07 you might want to think a second before he answered this one the best moment of your bodybuilding career tough one um a great moment was placing second at the USA in 2003 it was also one of the most depressing moments because I really thought I was going to win and get my pro car I I thought I you know once they announced me in second I I really believed I was much better than Chris Cook he was really smooth that show I was more concerned with Matt Duvalme and Russell piece and Eddie Moison at that show and I beat them and then I said you know what what the hell's going on here you know and I want to take in second so that was a great highlight it was a terrible also terrible um I probably say that you know winning junior nation was really good in 95 I really enjoyed that when uh probably in the body building world getting a metrics contract was was my dream back from the day so that was huge meaning Scott Conley and all that stuff that was super exciting but you know it's tough because I never really won the USA in the national so you know I had so many seconds it was hard to say like what was really great I guess in 2002 when I play second my 20th frame into the NPC national in Dallas that was super excited because I didn't expect to get that um so placing second like that was was great and actually Tony and I were pretty close to that show so um that was a soup that was a highlight I guess and you know probably getting featured in Muscle Development and I guess he needs to be black when had paraburnal shoot me and there was some great photo shoots that were published in that those were probably I was probably more proud of that than of anything because it was it's installed it's you know it's there forever that is going to do for this episode of As Dave brought to you by Specy Nutrition again visit speciesnutrition.com for Dave Blumbo and our producer Tyler Shore I'm Sadie Furuki we'll see you next time.
