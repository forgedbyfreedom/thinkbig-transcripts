I'm standing here with Chuck Zito. He just punched me in the nose. I'm bleeding a little bit, but Chuck, you're looking young every time I see it. I'm not saying it's just because I'm trying to get a buddy up. You do look great. Thank you, man. Thank you. You got all your half. A few more pounds. Oh, definitely I want all my hair. Unbelievable. My grandfamble. I was 28 years old, yet it's full head of hair. My father, 78, full head of hair. So my hair's not going away. Last time we spoke, you were supposed to do a little MMA fighting. What happened with that one? Well, I tried to do that when I was in my 50s. Now I'm 59 as a buddy. Are you 59? My first two days ago. Congratulations. Thank you. And maybe when I'm 60, maybe let me do it. I don't know. So what do you think I'm trying to tell me? I was too old, but I want to fight a guy at my age. So one day I'll happen. You never know. Today's young, we'll see what happens here. You might not try to really cut toys here. Maybe we could arrange that. Yeah, I think he's a greatest MMA fighter ever. Right? I mean, he's battled everyone. He's done it all, man. And what to look at him? Look at him. He's 44, I think. He still looks phenomenal. He probably could still trade. Did he have any intention of fighting? I think he still fights. He actually retired, but of course, he still trains. Look at him. He's phenomenal. That's right. But still on him and everybody's all. He's following your footsteps. He's all mine. Yeah. Now you looked at the jackets when you came in and you saw the very familiar. That's pretty wild, man. Especially to read on a white. That's your colors. That you used to be. Yeah. You made a good point. You know, I said, I copy this from a son's anarchy. And you said, they copied you guys. How did they copy you guys? Me. I'm the one and only guy who coined a phrase front line nine. And they were not your first nine. Like you have first five. Right. I copy them, but I actually copied five knuckles. That's right. I got hit with the first five knuckles. What happened? How come they didn't ever bring you on as a consultant on that show? I figured you'd be the perfect guy. They actually have two Hells Angels from Oakland that consultants on a show. Lee and D.L. It was a David LaBrava show. But I had a big, when it first came out, I had a lawsuit against them. Because I went in 2004, gave them my life, my script, my everything. But you did. And then he said, they passed, they didn't want to do a motorcycle series. And then the next thing he knew, they were working on a motorcycle series. But I was so young for the last two years. I lost some re-judgment. And then I appealed it. And then Kurt Sutter, who was the creator, writer, producer, star, showrunner. If me have them, the husband of Katie Sigot, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. And look at her. She's a big fan of hers. Amazing because her girl came from our marid with children. You know, can you believe that? To the crazy bike girl. And she does look the part. She does. She fits well. She's amazing actress. By like her. And me and Kurt Sutter buried the hatchet. And we put everything behind us. And I decided to drop the lawsuit. And now I'm working on the fifth season of a sons of Anagheon. Oh, you're going to be on? I'm going to be on a man. You're going to start it, too? Yeah. So they got the right guy. Basically, he'll say in goes, if you can't beat him, join him. So I might as well join him. You should have been on it from the very beginning. You're authentic. Can you or an act? Thank you very much. I said that. But is the show, I mean, you've watched it, obviously. Yes. Is it very accurate, according to the way the bike or gangs were? Oh, look. They have a couple of health angels who consultants on it. A lot of it's accurate. They do a great job. The whole cast is, I think, phenomenal. I can't wait to work with Kurt Sutter. I'm going to the rest of the cast, but we're going to make a more authentic. That's what we learned. So, and they go, let me be me. Where are my boots and where are my everything? They can stop you from being you. You're always you, with everything part you playing on me, man. But I'm looking forward to doing the FF season. In fact, they just signed three more seasons. They did. I'm happy to hear that. They would be around for a while. So I'm looking forward to working, starting on May. And of course, it goes on FX in September. And just looking forward to kicking butt on it. Congratulations, Chuck. Thank you, Barry. It's always good to play this season. Thank you very much. Likewise. Chuck Lido. I like the colors, dude. You do? You endorse it? The red and white, though, what? Very, very, I'm paying homage to you. It's not even very close. It's the same exactal letters, the bone letters, everything. Pay homage to you. I won't wear these out. I only wear them to bodybuilders. What I could say is, you're lucky. I'm not in the club no more. Now the blood's running down my face a little more. Chuck, thanks man. Oh, pleasure. Thank you for having me.
