I actually ran into Joel, but I don't expect him to be here. We do not. We do not. We do not. Yeah, I was wrong. But the two hours were not clear. We were downtown and then the goal was to get for a day or two. He's working with me from my house. Thomas has put the share for the North Americans. So I'm excited about that. I watched you keep working to see some footage before they are. Or we need to talk here. So he's turning you near a very hard. I was impressed with me. I'm tense. He is asleep. The normal workout was this. So this is the everyday training that we're going to work on. Yeah, every time I'm trying to live with you, Tom's. And they're having some push me. So people work really well together. But you're using tense and it's nice to be trying some part of the next thing. Okay. How did you get into the band when you get into the community when you're helping for a counter-chime? Well, we met a couple of years ago. We were trying to get into the California. I've heard a couple of weeks. Since then, we've done like a chance of being a, we just kind of kept in touch. And now it's down to 10 or so. It's really close to me. He knows I've been some guidance. So it's really a good time in the training. So he's been awesome. I'm a little bit better. I think you have a lot of stress. The first time I've been in the end. And it's kind of the year when you can surprise everybody. That national is a heavyweight. And you did. You got to get the place. Yeah. I didn't know what to expect. That was obviously, you know, I know what exactly one of the, like, but as far as cutting out on the scene, that was a very impressive name. You'd be the one that seems to be the one that seems to be out on the scene. What is the difference between the last year and the one that seems to be out on the scene? What is the difference between the last year and the one that seems to be out on the scene? I'm not sure. I'm kind of in a hydrating flat knot. I think it's much easier than to show that it is. It seems like I'm watching this year. So, you know, I was making a little flat or something. I was expecting. What a story. We remember the happened with my, I'm a glacier. This year I said, I've got a lot of footwear. I tried to get some little more intense and a little more focused. I was kind of shabby when we get more stuff together. But I was just, this year's news to become a lot more awesome. How did you love taking more of American to why you just said, and this one is that the national is coming. All I'm talking about here is, you know, it's a different show. You know, you know, say, how everything's going to be shown. There's always something in the national's. And I heard that. And I've heard that there's a national message you're ready to become a couple of about football players. Well, for one thing I did, I was just looking at you. It was obviously your biggest last few minutes in around 2012. Yeah, I was in a week, to 14 and my hands and in a state shop. I was like, to what? And what do you think about this? Should I further come forward? I cannot run this command for a film the outdoors again. So, you got a point that you got. That's good. That's one of the good. It's a good, it's a Joel Thomas, Eric Samarx, which was a lot of time to be seen in North American in what? Seven. You know, who was this at the week? Seven weeks? Arturo. Thanks, buddy.
