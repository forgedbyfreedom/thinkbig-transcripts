And something we don't often see is that Jene actually went back post-transition and competing against men just because I guess like it was kind of like she's gone back and forth competing with men and women based on I don't know what I mean that's just a dick move no pun intended Okay pun intended I'm a fucking tranny so I can make that pun anyways Day Palombo here with an RX muscle rant all right guys and preparing you're just gonna be a controversial one Want to say right off the bat? I have a very good friend. Okay in this industry Originally his name was Mad Croc he transitioned he's now a woman you probably know him as Jene Marie Croc he was a powerlifting and bodybuilding star You know tremendous amount of muscle mass one of the nicest guys of a met I've interviewed him as both Matt I've interviewed him as Jene There's a I guess you could say a YouTube personality called Blair White okay Supposedly you know from what I gathered she is a trans gender herself She was a male now she's a female and she has a very popular YouTube channel It's got about a million subscribers so that's obviously a lot of people watch these videos and she did a video on Well part of the video was was dedicated to Jene Marie and her I guess to stain at the fact that she felt that Jene Marie Okay was looking to compete against women in powerlifting and bodybuilding and she found it Appalling ludicrous you know She even called it a dick move at one point in the video Now if anyone if you any of you guys know Jene Marie okay Not a bad bone in this person's body sweetheart, you know just loves to lift super passion for for body-billing and the strength sports Whether she's a girl or she's a boy or she's back and forth and she considers her trans You know fluid gender I guess you could call it It doesn't matter she loves to lift okay, so one of the things is she doesn't identify her sex with You know how big she is muscular However she's also said that she never would consider competing with the women because she knows it's unfair And it would also cast a bad light on the transgender community because she would be trying to you know Be people who are genetically and who are muscular and theory to her because she developed as a male Okay, and she knows that and she's gone on record even on our TV show She's gone on record the thing I was never compete as a woman bodybuild. I would never compete as a woman power left it because I would break every record it wouldn't even be it would not be fair I understand that but she still identifies herself as a woman So why this Blair white has decided to go on this this attack and I call it I call it cyber bullying I call it trans bullying if you wanted to know the truth I don't care if she's a transgender or not She attacked the jenei put her down made her seem like she was trying to you know get over on the fact that she had all this You know muscle that she developed as a man and now was trying to use it to exploit You know the woman side of the sport and just beat everyone just because she wants to win things that's bullshit because you know what Jenei Wouldn't choose a natural bodybuilder Competed in the open division with all the people who were using drugs because she didn't care She just wanted to be the best next to you could be and what you decided to To use Supplements she's still competed with the same people she wants to be the best of what she does She doesn't have to win the women's division and she never ever went on record So I think it's a polling that this girl I don't care I'm gonna follow with she's got I don't care. I'm gonna be subscribed. She's got it. I'm gonna count popular she is She's bullying jenei Marie and I'm gonna stand up for our iron brothers and sisters in this sport If someone on the outside goes on the attack and tries to cast an dispersion and make this person seem like they're not A good person and that they don't have a genuine heart and that they're looking to take advantage of the fact that they're That they've decided to transition to another sex For purposes of promoting themselves because that's just not the case So you know what get your facts straight okay, Blair as my father would say You know I don't even want it my father would call her a ninkum poop because you know what If you really wanted to verify your facts and see if your story was accurate you could have called her up You could have reached out to jenei and jenei would have gotten back to you in two seconds amount of fact I think jenei told me because I just was looked out at the phone with her that she Her people that she's you know Publiscist and everything has tried to reach out to this Blair white and I don't think that she may've heard back anything so Blair should have reached out to her God her side of the story before doing this condensing you know YouTube video on her probably just For you know to get people to watch her stuff because it is obviously very Polarizing because you look at jenei and she's huge and she's a female now and of course she's an easy target But that's what bullies do they they pick easy targets and they go after them You know what I I appreciate and respect what Blair is doing on our YouTube channel in the sense that she's trying to get more Notariety for the trans community and if she whatever her political you know Views are I don't care it doesn't matter because everyone's a title through her pain But before you go and bullying someone and make them feel bad about themselves in a subject You know nothing about the body bullying and fitness industry get you fact straight I'm Dave polombo within our ex muscle rare You're lying to her or you're lying to others and you're lying to your subs
