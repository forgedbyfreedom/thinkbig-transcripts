kah The School Times held 16th chain flag meeting at the university opening season 300,000 years remaining against a secondary decision. 네! I'm Dave Holyumbo, founder of Species Nutrition. I created Species Nutrition with one mission in mind. To provide Bodybuilders and serious athletes with no nonsensse supplements that work in our backed by science. From my earliest bodybuilding days I believe in only putting the best in my body and that In this species nutrition line of products, we use only top of the line formulations toast for maximum results and the best flavoring systems available. I've put my name and reputation on every bottle of species nutrition products. If you want to be your absolute best, join the evolution. When you are asleep, they're just getting started. John, Dave Pulonga, after hours. Welcome back to After-Hours, as always I'm Dave Pulonga here with John Romano. Looking to get in a little bit of trouble today as always. You know that's our stick, right John? Usually. But before we get in a trouble, I wanted to start off this show with an ass-day of question. Hmm. Not if you don't mind. Yes, sure. Impossible. To become addicted to fiber lunas. You know, I got someone who actually sent me a testimonial, man, to read it to me today. The guy had like, sigmoid colon surgery and the guy has never had a regular bowel movement and he was been tried men amused to try to everything and he was miserable. And one, like, I think after like a week on fiber lunas, he's completely normal going to the bathroom. People don't understand that their sillyum is not a silly. You know, when you go with this story and see this, you buy this like sillyum seed. It's like a generic, like, you know, flavorless and you figure, well, this has got nothing in it. This has got to be the pure stuff. It's not. It's the cheap stuff. There's different grades of sillyum and you know, I had to do a lot of research to think, I didn't even notice John initially. I used to be one of those sugar-free men amused to guys too and it just never did anything for me. When I did my research on this and talked to a lot of manufacturers, I found that there's different swell rate syliums and we use the highest swell rate meaning that's why when you put it in a glass it turns to gelo to stuff. You want it to be that even holder. You know, you got to like, three seconds to drink. Yes, you know, but I have a lot of people who put it in the refrigerator and eat it like gelo when they're dieting because they're starving to death, you know. And I'll try that. You need like an industrial wire brush to clean the glass after you. But no, I'd be product info aside. I didn't mean to turn this into a commercial. I don't want it. As far as the feeling, when you have that bowel movement and it's like you're empty, you know, there's like no question about it. There's nothing left. You are empty. And God, that feeling is so good, you know. I mean, you're like, it's like the light on your feet. If you were so smart, I don't know if you were following the Hassan, Hassan, Hassan, Hassan Mustafa who Chris Asidoh works with, he had a really bad case of hemorrhide that we're bleeding and got infected. And you know what that's from John. It's from straining, you know. And when you eat, you know, eight times a day and you're eating low fiber foods because, you know, you're on a diet and stuff like that, your carbs allow, you become really constipated. And you know, you could really do some serious damage to that lower, you know, part of your intestinal tract. So you're typically where it exits, you know. And that's why you guys get hemorrhides from straining like that. And you know, we're so strong from squatting our pelvic muscles is so powerful that we can really do some serious damage. So with fiber, you know, when you take a product like cyber, it just slides at you. You don't have to strain, you know. You don't get hemorrhides, you know. And sitting on a toilet for hours, the fricking is no good for that. Now, I told Jimmy to bulk because, you know, he taught dogs and there's no fiber and not dogs. And he had hemorrhide problem for a while. And I said, you got to take fiber like I said, you're eating fucking crap. At least it'll move it out of your body quickly, you know. And he does that stack of toilet paper, he's got to last them. It'll last the room and rest of his life. And rather that's like the most efficient means of toilet resources. Yeah, having fiber lies in your diet because you sound on wipe time and consumption significantly. It's amazing. But it's just that feeling. I mean, I guess you can say I'm addicted to that feeling because if I don't take it. And like I won camping last weekend and I didn't take fiber lies. And I noticed the difference the next day, I was miserable the whole freaking day. Yeah. But you know, I did it. I said, I'm just miss one serving of it. And I only go, I don't get my two movements of the day. And I'm like upset. I can feel like I don't feel as good. I feel like something in my stomach and it's not, I don't feel as like he said his empty and I think so. Do you take a twice a day? Yeah. If you take a twice day, you've got a much better response from a two. I think. I just started, yeah, I just started doing that morning and night. I got to send you, I got to send you more remind me. I don't want you to run out. Dice as to, you know, if you ever need any fiber lies and if I ever, my manufacturer stops producing it's called, guy as to, you know, he has like a year of supply in his house. Hey, so he's another addict. You should probably have fiber lies anonymous. Yeah. It's like a very secret cult club of, you know, I'm literally scared of it not being available. Yeah. But that are not run out of that ship, at least until it's still alive. It's been, it's, I'm trying to get great Valentina's phone can't, you know, accept the length for zoom. We have to have the email to him like, you know, the old days, you know. So, so, I wanted to ask your question. If you've noticed that MD is still printing magazines. Yeah, you know, someone asked, one of my clients was saying, oh, I'm so happy. I'm in the magazine. It's pretty cool to see my picture. I'm like, today, do they actually have magazines anymore? I didn't even know that they even printed any magazines anymore. I'm not saying, like paper or did he go to Zinya? Is he actually still printing and shipping paper? He is. I think he still has, probably obviously has still a couple of people paying him. I don't know why. I think for some reason, high tech likes to take ads at magazines. I don't know what the, well, the Jared uses that as a CADLON. Yeah, and he's nostalgic or something like that. I don't know. He throws a 3-3 copy adad in every order. Oh, that was out of this. I said, yeah. So, he thinks, yeah, he has his, he has his social media belief in that his magazine. It pretty much is John. He's paying for it. Pretty much. Yeah. Oh, if, if black middle off is high tech, forget about it. You know, if the seller, that's over done in the tank. I don't know why he didn't even want to do the magazine at this point though, because it's probably just paying the cost of the magazine. Unless it's just like an ego, I think at this point, you know. It's totally an ego thing. Come on, that's all it is. It's all it ever was. It's an ego thing. Speaking of black men, you know. You know, people always ask why we talk about him. And it's not that I'm not like even looking to talk. It just creeps up on us and it's, you know, no, no pun intended about the creep. Well, to be fair, I mean, it's a historic. I mean, he does occupy his story at Gellon. And we are keeping him pretty relevant by talking about him. I think it's actually what doing on the favor, right? Oh, yes. I'm absolutely what we're doing on the favor, but, but you know, the reality is is that at some points because of our history with him and the magazine, and it's painful to watch, you just like, you know, it's like you're riding the camel and both the pumps are all used up. There's no fluid left then. And he's like dead. And he's trudging through just saying one, one hoof for the time, you know. And it's, he should've just gotten out when it was big and good, you know. Hey, can you guys hear me? Hey, I was stalling for the guy on because I wanted to, I want to show, I don't know if you, if you saw a Greg or anyone, I know John hasn't seen it yet, but that there's a video YouTube channel that I call like my sugar daddy has something or another. What is it called? Tyler? Oh, sir, I don't even want to give him too much credit. But he always grabs stuff from anything of mine. He likes to put stuff from day to day, pull up out there. And it's like, it seems to be popular. It's a YouTube channel. This guy like re-edits like videos of mine, like training videos, something that I've done in the past and guess posing, puts him up. He edited it, re-edited it in some video. He took all the black men impressions they did with the black men puppet, you know, I have, where's the book? Oh, God. And he put it, like in like he spliced it together with the actual black men, um, talking himself, you know, black men does John these like little vlogs for black, the act of vlogs, where he actually talks about nutritional supplements. Have you seen, you remember the ones who played like about a year ago? Yes. All right, what he's got a new one. Is this the CBD one? He has the one he recorded in the bathroom? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this one's like out, I think he has back yard of some like that. But so this guy spliced together a bunch of black men doing something and then he goes to me, they went like the black men and pop it. So I'm going to play a little bit and then we can we can talk about it. This one's a funny one. So all right, let's just, this one, this must be his new house because the last one did you with you would say. Now, and you knew you've been at his house. So you would now. So that's that's not his house. All right, let's, let's play this one. Hey guys, this is Steve Black men for another AML health and nutrition report. Today I want to talk about Kanbadao, CBD. It's the talk of the town. A miracle cure. The hottest supplement trend in years and the FDA hasn't even approved it in food and supplements. Sales growth of CBD is projected to reach 22 billion. 2022. The hype on CBD is way ahead of the science. Latest research shows that CBD could lower dope in being in the brain and may inhibit long-term cognitive function. More information on CBD in cognitive function, go to advancemerklafs.com and read my new article entitled New Research, Kanbadao. CBD lowers dope in being dope or less cocktail to the rescue. Until next time, remember knowledge is power. Lee, I think we need to give you another contract. Of course. I have an idea for marketing. What do you tell you what, I'll put you on the cover. How about that? I'll make you a star. I know I've done it before. Please, sir. I have this. Lee, Prisma, Sthlach, slow is. Woo! Steve, Steve, can you give me a good contract? What's this, Steve? Are they impracticing just for the contract? Oh! Oh! Steve, did you see that? Oh! He's got a slow, slow, slow, slow. Lee, they're very strided. I don't know if you've noticed them. Victor, I here is making it come back to. Maybe we could put you guys in a photo shoot together. I'll call Pairbinam. We'll get Dorian on the contract, too, because he's a legend. Hey, everybody. I'm going to eat for lunch. That's enough. I got enough. I don't know. The highest new trend in supplements. What can we have? It's always been... To talk in a tad. He's always got a problem. The bathroom was echoing. His generation of iron was the wind was blowing. His hair and the wind noise. And then, now he's got the airplane flying over the canyon. And then he's in the hot tub with the hot tub bubbly. He can't hear what the fun thing. He never was in pity. After we reported him, he said, What the fuck? You can't find echoing something. Come in to fucking bathroom. I would've never put that out. Now he's got the airplane flying. I know it's over the long island sun. The airplane told when the fucking sun was on. Which night club is going on? I've been there many times. Let me ask you, is the magazine... Is it still there? Or is it like a zair still a paper? The book is clearly... Apparently there is. Because somebody printed a poster picture of a magazine issue. So then he was in... Oh, it is. Is it but is it like spring winter summer fall or is it every other? You know, I don't know. I don't see it like a calendar. Greg, it comes out once a year. No. Really? Oh no. Is it probably like four issues? He only... He only throw it because he likes doing it. That's his little... My other question critique is, Why the fuck is he so angry? And till he's with the sunglasses he would be. Fix his Valentine's. Yeah. He's a gentleman. So like... Make this. Yeah. He's got a maker. What is he got that? What is he got that bark in it you like? You know, CBD. Yes. Yeah. I don't... The journalist bet... You got to listen to me. He... And the article that I wrote. It'll read the article. The one who fought Billion by 1222. What the hell? Where does he get his advertising act? He's always... He's always done that. This is the best thing in the newest thing. But I gotta tell you one thing. That fucking guy does not look like how old is he got his... He does not age. He doesn't age. Hi. Oh no. He's got use genetics. Oh my god. He's got to be 65 at least. He's... He was seven years older than me. So yeah, he's 60 years old. He's probably... He's a 70 years old. He's almost 70 years old. Yeah, he's almost 70 years old. He looks amazing. Yeah. I mean, he's... Sitten there. He looks like he was in his 30s. Oh no. He's not 100. He'll live 200. No doubt. He knew what he did. From the guy's in the office. That he was down to eat and like one meal a day. Everything is done. All he ever ate is one meal. Yeah. Intermittent fasting. I read the article. Intermittent fasting. That's why Jack O'ayam lives so long. I got to intermittent fasting. He would eat lunch sometimes. And he would... He would eat lunch sometimes. And he would... He was always eating dinner with a bot. And he would drink at least one bottle of wine. John. Yeah. He would... Yeah. Increases life of a... Yeah. He would... He would... I got a... I'm a... I'm a trend of change so difficult. It just made me think of something. About a guy who's actually a big fan of this show. He said... I mean, a huge fan. He actually had a fan of the show. I didn't know that. That's good. We... we have a couple. And most of my ask me why you're drawing stuff all the time. Yeah. I'm not going to draw. I told people I wouldn't draw. You should actually fucking sell one of those things. Like this is... I was going to sell the 20. You know, I was going to send it to you. I was going to sell it to you. I was going to sell it to you. Who would have sent it to me? I would have... But I got to say something. Dave... Dave and John... I want to... You guys are... You know, versed on this stuff. This guy... His name is Vinny Altairo. If you're watching God bless you, I hope you get better. Listen to this. Because we were just talking about black man. This guy's in the 60's. He... he fucking... He hasn't had a slice of pizza. Passed it anything in 25. 26 years. Okay. He... he fasts for three days and a row sometimes. He eats... Nothing... no... he hasn't had any meat in about 25. 26 years. Right. He... he actually... he... Dave... he listens to everything. He listens to everything you say. He's dramatic with this. And he actually drinks his... You know, like he'll make a... a smoothie. And that's all he will have for a day. And it's... you know, he'll put like King Wan, all the sudden shit. He just had a fucking massive, massive, massive heart attack. But he actually died on a field. I heard... He runs every day, runs, wins, branch, runs long. There's the... You saw this guy, walk-tron. It doesn't take any steroids. He was a natural body, but he walks around shredding. Like... not normal. I mean, like... like bodybuilding... He's not having any other blockage. I don't... I'm not sure yet. He's still in the hospital right now. He was dying then. You know, he's an intensive care. But what I'm saying is, Dave, this guy... If you would have thought anybody would live to be a hundred... It would have been this guy. He was so clean living. Generating. Generating. That's why you got to get your diagnostic test, Greg. You got to get that cardiac CT to see if your blood... Your... your... cardiac vessels are open. You know? The adunetics will over supersede the best diets sometimes, you know? See, that's what I'm trying to get at. See, these guys... people have watched this. He was a vegan. I mean, full-fledged... 100% vegan. So, there goes the vegan myth. But... and... you know... He watched our shows. When we were talking about shit sometimes, you would tell me, Now, you guys, you know... I don't know, I disagree because I blast vegans all the time. Yeah. And... but... You've never seen anybody eat this clean. He's like... the rare white buffalo. And... for him to have a heart attack, makes you feel mortal. And we... But... But on animal source protein, though... Or him not having animal source protein, Look at the scene is the... you mean, OAS, right? Date that... that's in animal source protein... That he wasn't yet... Well... you know... You know... There's bhaiyf tham... Where's the... Broly is... Well, he's a genetic time clock. When that time clock goes off, you know... You could... you... you could expire very quickly, you know? He probably might... He might... He might... he could... he could... He could live this long if he would have been eating cranks. He said... I don't... I don't buy it to my whole... You know... all of this... He's... he's... he's... he's one of his children. We'll win him. When he was running, he would go... We'll do win sprints and run every day. He'd go to the football field. Yeah. He was... I'm going to tell you one thing about the win sprints thing. You know what? I got caught up in this whole... And Johnny could probably test this. We're... we're so competitive, you know... And from the body building, you know... When I started body building, I lost weight. I got my... I... why if I... before we had kids, we got it to cycling. I... I'd... I'd... I'd... I'd... I'd... I'd... I'd went and bought a set bicycle. And then of course I had to have the best one. And then I got into this whole... You know... try to ride fast with all the other guys. So I was in the endurance athlete when I was younger. You've remembered that. I was a runner. So I started... Like cycling with these guys that have been cycling for 30 years. And... I was keeping up with them. They were like, where did you come from? How long you been doing this? I said, you know... four weeks. They're like, what? I just had an accurate... But you know what? What was happening? I was getting... I was throwing weird heart rhythms. And I was singing on the cardiac, you know, my monitor, you wear when you ride. And I told... and that's why I had found that... I had a cardiac arrhythmia. You know, arrhythmia. The... probably had my whole life just never really pushed that heart. You know, my... and now in my 50s and... Or at the time I was in my late 40s. And you know, the doctor said something to me that really struck a chord. He's like, why are you peddling? Why are you riding so hard? I said, because I... I got to get in shape. I said, he's like, can shape for what? What do you do? Are you doing a triathlon? I said, no. I said, but... I can do it. You go, well, just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should be doing it. You know, you're... in your almost 50 years old, he said, Why you cycling like your Lance Armstrong? And you know what? I said to myself, he's right. Well, put it... put it my end to you. Why am I pushing myself to this insane degree at this age? It does no benefit to an amount of fact. It might be a detriment to it because I'm pushing my body too hard. It doesn't need to be pushed that hard. And I'm not 25, 30 years old anymore. So I cut back and I try to start enjoying it a little bit more. But the point is sometimes when you're an extremist and it continues into your old age, you can... you can kill yourself, you know? You're pushing... Because you can push it faster than the barrier, you know? What about buy billing date? That's a great point you just made. Same thing with buy billing. I'm a serious one. You're probably shrinking. You're doing, you know, you shouldn't weigh 280 pounds, you know? But what if you still train? Like I still train the way I... In a way, it's the train. I've already gone to the gym after this. You know, and I'm going to... I do a blow instead of what I can't do it any other way. Right. But you know what? Who knows? If you had a predisposition for, you know, having a harden with me, you might give you some harden tack and die. I don't know. I don't know how hard you push in the gym. I'm just saying... Well, it's fine. But you know what? If you were unprobably a thousand... 10,000 milligrams a year a day, that probably would kill you. You know, I don't know. I'm going to take control. It's right. Yeah. I'm doing hormone replacement therapy. And that's just... But that's just... Well, place... The trick is you got to get checked out. If your heart checks out is good, then you can do it. If you have an arrhythmia, you know, where you have a blockage and when you're coronary, or you're doing that kind of training, you can have a harden tack in the gym and drop dead. You know, there's no doubt about that. That's why you couldn't... To die, you're helping us to... You're helping us to keep it in a CPR. We're giving them CPR on a field. I think you was dead on a field. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, the two are mutually exclusive. Whether you train or what method of training you're doing and whether or not you're going to have a heart attack, a little bearing on each other, if you're predisposed to have an heart attack. I mean, that's just the way it is. Well, we're... Certainly you can contribute, you know, to factors that are going to increase your odds of having a heart attack. But if you're... You're going to have a heart attack. You're going to have a heart attack. And it doesn't matter if you're bowling, playing ping pong or body building. That's just... That's just way the way it is. Do you guys remember that the runner gym fix... He wrote a book? He wrote a book? Yeah. He wrote a book about running. And they told... It's the heart doctor told him, because he had a heart condition. He said, look, if you continue running, okay, you're going to die of a heart attack. And he's like, you know what? If I stop running, I'm going to die of a heart attack. Because I got to belong to my heart. So he continued running. He wrote like three, four books about running. One of the most... Some of the most popular books at the time in the 80s. I remember. He did win of dying. I think, well, he was running. I'm a heart attack. He had a bad heart. You know? But it wasn't from the running. I don't even know if he died. I don't think he was running when he had a heart attack. It was after he finished running or something like that. But he would have died even early. Because his dad had died at a very young age in his 30s. And he lived in 2s like 60s. So... It is what it is. You know what I mean? It's... We're dealt the hand. You know? And sometimes the parts old don't work as well. We'd like them to work. And as we get older as you guys know. But they break way easier. And we don't fix so easily. And so, you know, we all have our little things that are wrong with us. And you got to just be aware of them. And then not be afraid to admit we have limitations as we get older. Because if you don't, and you try to go beyond that, sometimes you're asking for trouble. You know? You know, what I notice is the... First of all, weights feel heavier. You know? And I know they're not. They just feel it. And I feel more beat up after my workout. It's now that I used to the recovery. You know? Oh yeah. I know what I mean. I know my lower at the four days a week instead of five for training. Because I really feel like I need that extra day arrest. I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, you know, you don't want to... I guarantee. The thing is, we're all in our 60s. Dave, you're only 51. 2. Are you even 52? I'm 52. All right. See you at 52. I'm 52. Wait. You're a baby still. John, you... You're birthday just keeplist when. Next month, I'll be 60. Oh, I thought it was September. No, October. No, October. You're today's my sons birthday, 30. Shit. Wow. I've got to be 63. Chris, is today. Are you real? You were born with a birthday. No, I'm waiting for the hurricane. We got all the hurricane swells right now. So, sir, you're going to serve the 104 wave again. I got, well, I got... I hit the pipe, the other day, the front of my board. Oh, front of my nose. This is big pipe. That place I've wear is served. Yeah. I hit that with my board. The whole nose, front of the nose came more. You hit a car. But drain pipe? Yes, a big pipe. You hit me? Yeah. And you're still alive. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Get the pain. Back in the album. Mr. Ghee, it's like the quintessential, like, you know, anomaly. You don't do anything he does. If you try to do anything he does, you'll die. That's basically the... No one can take a beating like him. He does it. No one can take a beating like him. He doesn't go to any doctors. I asked him when he left, I mean, went to a doctor. He's... I like me, I never go here. Dude, I went to a doctor about four years ago when stuff... Hey, take care of my health. What was the last time you went to a real doctor, George? Not a car or a friend. Dr. Ghee, damn. Can you remember? 30...30 years ago? I went here in a half. I'll live 220, I guarantee he'll be the guy in the... Oh, what? I'm doing... I'm doing all the stuff I'm supposed to be doing anyway. Right. All right. So what is it matter? Let's take it to tell me, you know, that I'm not... That I'm not already doing things to take care of my health. Wow, I mean, you don't know something's wrong with you, right? I mean, they couldn't be... Even if there was such a wrong, I'm still gonna... I'm still gonna... Well, I mean, what if you... I'm going for a call and ask to be on Friday. I'll get your chance. I'll give it to you. You'll give... I don't want... I don't want you or Blackman touching my anal region, but... I'm going for a call and ask me because you're supposed to get one after 50. And you know what? There was people in my family who had cancer, so I want to make sure, you know, I've kids obviously young kids. I got to check it out. But I put it off. I probably should have had it two years ago. Have you guys all had call and ask me? I've had two. I've had none. Did you find anything in yours, Chun? Yes, I had... The first one I had seven polyps. Okay. So you see that? You say you're self-attacking cancer down the road. And then five years later, I had another one. I won last year and there were no polyps. Okay. But you say you saved yourself. I mean, that could have turned into cancer. They were the ones that... The kind that do turn. Oh, they do. Okay. So you're lucky. So I mean, George has gone to a doctor. Greg has been there 60 years old. I mean, you guys should get a call and ask me because you just don't know. And it's such an easy test. And they snip those little... One thing going there, you just take the polyps right out. So... Way better than having to deal with a cancer situation, you know, five years from now. So... And they put you out. No. I'm going to... I mean, all that is the hospital. You know. Yeah. I'm going to show you the old thing. I don't know how to make a life. Oh, there you are. I can go and talk to my food. In one place. Highler, mute him for a second. Thank you. Oh. In the old days, they used to be awake for the colonel. I've been out of fun. You're... And you're not proud. You're completely out. So it's like... You're sitting on a page read. Why are you always screwing up our audio? God's given. John's given his wisdom. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. All right. Listen.

Start saying that I fucking for. So they end up putting it in a little hallway and they say the floor is down. So I go there and they're piloting. I went there out of here through. I see the refrigerator in a hallway. I can't do a hallway because the fucker is finished sitting in a little hallway. I can't say it. So I had to come back at a late thing. So I tell them. I said, listen to that. I told them that Danny there. I said, do me a favor. Don't walk on these floors. They're going to pile in a half hour. Get whatever you need upstairs because they're going to be pile in. Okay. I said, you understand. Next. Yeah, you understand. I told them to come back. I was late. Guess what? The lady.

Like, geez, this Christ, I says, you kidd me, right? I said, you should go. So when about the fridge ready, you left it in the hall. If I said, he said, the fridge guys, get fixed. No, me more than me. No, we're not with garbage. I said, well, he just told us that the touch of this guy is coming to fix the fucker. No, he's getting involved. I said, can you people get your shit together? So it's unbelievable. Unbelievable what I go through. I just can't have a fucking normal fucking average thing. I just go to jail. Here we go. How are they going to move that refrigerator back without fucking up the floor? And that's the game, everyone. They are going to know the one. But they say not the repair guys going to come and fix the fucker. And wherever it is, because I told my he touching that motherfucker anymore. Right. It's going to fuck the floor. Like John said, it's so heavy. When we roll it, it's going to leave big marks in the floor. Right. So I said, you know, I told the door. I said, you know what? I'm getting paid. I'm getting paid. The refrigerator. What's this? How did it come back? I'll do the floor. How did they get it? How did they get it? Yeah. How did they get it? I don't know why. She told me they took it. They took it through the back door. It was impossible. I got the measure. I measured everything. It's no fucking way. Unless they took those doors out completely. They get it out in the fucking house. Because it was a sliding door. I wasn't going to fit, you know, true. But I take the one door off like we used to do. Right. It wouldn't even go through that. I don't know how they got it in it. I have no idea. So I'm out of the whole fucking thing. I just want to get my fucking check. You haven't got paid yet? You haven't got paid yet? You haven't got paid? No. You're not going to get paid. Then I can pay you. Then I can pay you. You watch. So I went there last night to the door shop. I'm sitting down. I thought I was going to get a paycheck. And I was just saying, you haven't even bought it. I said, no, I don't have it. And I didn't even buy it. You know. And you got to finish that spot. I said, yeah, we're going to finish this spot. When you get the fucking frigid right away. I said, what finished this spot? You know what I mean? So I didn't wish you could sit there. I'm going to be like, say, you look a little hype. I was just saying, if I could sit there. I was just saying, I'm alone. I'm alone strong out right now. She said, sit there. Please, can you say my follow is there? I said, I should put you on your list. Why? I started drinking one. Then I'm drinking my dad's house. Then I'm drinking with the old man. He might be a sound. I tell you, true. It's something my dad. Yeah. He even looks like you dad. I can't decide your picture. Because he's 87 years old. He's not even fucking my brother. He wanted you to sit down and watch real fortune. I said, my dad. I said, I mean, that's what he said. You know what I mean? So I tried one glass, two glass, three glass. They goes one bottle.

She says, come on. You gotta have been with us. I should have gone. I said, I didn't fucking get it. Give me that bottle. I should have gone. She must have fucking threw the bars. I'll get lost. I'll get back a row of knees. I'll just go. I'll just go. Fuck a sea. It's a sour. They're bread, thyme, but we eat. Dude, fuck it. I was just like, fuck it. Then it's like, fuck it. This is a regular day. This is just like a regular day. That's a regular day. That's a regular day. Bro, this is fucking shit. I have to stick with that. No. They didn't go. They wanted to get this. They wanted to get this. Yeah, that's what I was in the guitar. Six thirty I went there. Bro, I left there 10. Oh, I'm that. I'm like, fuck it. I said, piano friend. I said, I have to be out. I would have been out of believe me. I was saying that. Usually, by that I started singing at that point. By that, I was singing like, you know, songs. It's an opera. Did you hear me? Did you hear what Jimmy just said, though? He said that she even wrote a macaroni. That's what we called. That's what we called. That's what we called. That's what we called. It was Macaroni's with gravy or whatever. My right or wrong, Jimmy. It was Macaroni's if it was like, Compatelies of twists or or regular tone here or whatever. Oh, I was always. It was very good Tony it was very good Tony. It was very good Tony. Ballination. Yeah. But spaghetti was the long one. We always called that spaghetti. Yeah. We always called it Macaroni. Yeah, that's spaghetti. Yeah. It was Macaroni. It didn't matter what style. Right. But nobody called the pasta. And nobody called that shit sauce. It's gravy to us. Right. Yeah, gravy to us. Yeah, gravy to us. Oh, kids. Kids speak fluent Italian. They're like three, four, five years old. Oh, wow. It's diet. You know, it's funny. You know, it's funny is it's how stereotypically normal that evening was. You start drinking. Then they bring out the food. Yeah. We've done food. Then they need more food. Yeah. We've done more food. Yeah. You know how to lean. You don't want to lean after that. So you get about it. My brother was said, my brother was said, You know how you can tell when Italian is coming to dinner. They're ringing the doorbell with their elbow. They're not going to eat. They're not going to eat. Yeah. They're not going to eat. And they always say we don't have enough food. Right. I don't know if we have enough food. They have like 14 courses they bring out. They don't have enough food. That's what that's. Nobody I always just tell my grandmother once she just put it all on table at one time and let everybody you'll realize. No, no, they can't. At the time of the fucking, you know, but if time, you're the shit comes out. You sit and they're going, like, I fucking follow. She's still punctured out of the goddamn other. You know what I mean? They never sit down. They never sit down. They've stayed up to all of me auditioning out. Like, grandmother never sat down ever. And then later on, she was serving the kids. Yeah, she didn't sit down. She was serving the kids. Right. The table, the father. She was up to die. Get more wine. Get the salary. I won't tell the judge. Jimmy, how old was that woman's Stephanie? I've been talking about 40, she's about 41. Wow. And she's serving up Italian meal. Like that. That's a rare occasion. Wait a minute. Here's the real question. Did she get any top of words and give me shit to say calm? Yeah, that's right. I was just going to say that. You know what I have for breakfast is for. I don't look at that. I had a fucking rigoured Tony ball of bass. But he says, I'm going to play. I got up to small ones. I never got making it. I said no one fucked out. I saw the left toes on a bucket. I had two in a time. I was leaving. I was hit. I was hit by truck. I forgot to take the left toes. So I won't. And I finally walked down the house because I was fucking bomb. I mean, my truck she comes running outside with the fucking, kept up to the whole fucking tray, you know. Dum, Timmy please you got to think at all by sabah I give it to me. So I put it on their shoes. Oh no. Now when I've got up per morden I said k gu locates Sarah Jacobs Chandal Raghan, did I look at that tray and I'd go f girlfriends. I won't open his phone. You know what.. You know I have.. You don't idea who you got to get all the left toes on what's that? You know I have to keep Jimmy on the left over. Why? Cause the refrigerator doesn't work. That's not the fashion brat. nd he always been there. Leftovers. That's why I said, did you come home with a top of where full stuff? It's down. All the way. Before you trade, the foreign trade, I came. What would you do in either the next morning, two is the best? The taste better than it. I can call it. I like it called. Like any taste better. It's just some about that the next day you just like pizza. It's a place. It fits out all night. You have after you're making. Oh, it's delicious than next. The oil is in jails. That's why I said that. It's their bacteria and it takes even better. Oh, it's like a probiotic. It's like probiotics, John. Right. It's fermented. Right. Yeah, shit. Those were the days. Natural enzymes. Yeah. Hey, what the other, this we still do it. I mean, that's, you know, that's part of being a talent. And I hate that that's dying out with with us. You know, I'm going to tell you something about a good, a woman who can cook Italian food, they can cook anything. I'll tell you. And I've said this before. My grandmother, when I was, I was dieting for a show and they don't understand dieting. But she had a respected. So I was like, I grandma, I was dieting. I can't have the macaroni. And so she's like, what are you eating? I saw my mom eating chicken breast. I mean, baked potatoes. She made me a meal, John. She didn't use the stitch at oil on it. It was so clean this meal. But it tasted so good. I'm like, how did you make this? What's it? And I started getting paranoid. I'm like, what's in this grandma? I said, it tastes too good. I just pounded the chicken, it's for like six hours. And she just, I don't know, I don't know how she cooked it. There was no oil, nothing. It was the best chicken breast. And you know what it is? I'll tell you what it was. I'll tell you what it was. My grandmother, my grandmother can make a salad with oil and vinegar. And you'll salt. That's what it did to me. It was delicious. It's your hands. It's what it got. It's a food taste to say. I wish the sense that great salad dressing I've ever had in my life. It was just oil and vinegar. She did. She did olive oil. And vinegar. And she did salt, pepper. Like you said, that's all she said, she put on the chicken. I'm telling you it was the best tasting chicken and salad. And potato I ever had. Whatever it tastes, they know what they're doing. Yes. Under the old out of season, they know what the amounts are. Right. My grandmother, my grandma's amazing cook. She had a child main at the Chinese restaurant one time in her life. She said to herself, I think I can make this. I went over to her house one time. She gave me, she made me. She made chicken, chow main on a plate. And I'm looking at a, you know, you know, call out for food. You would never do that in a million years. If you picture it in a town, it'll tell you later. Go ahead. Never fucking have. Never. Okay. So like a way you get to Chinese road. She said, I made it. You made this. It tastes exactly like a Chinese restaurant. Like you couldn't tell with that. Wow. Because they can interpret the taste in our palate. Right. So, you know, it's. You do that shit now. We're low main and fried rice. So, which my girlfriend would have she tell you, I can make it better than Chinese restaurant. You know, what I used to do when I was, when I used to be in my ordering at sage, I used to get the low main with no seasoning. Like, without the oil, I get the low main with white chicken meat in there. You know, and I would add my own seasoning to it. And I'll tell you it was, it was 100 times better because it wasn't so heavy greasy. Yeah. But I love the way they mix the vegetables. The vegetables and the noodles are great. You know, coming to us. Remember, I didn't treat it in seafood. Yeah, that's the place. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do that. I phone over here. It's sorry. I had it on the fence back there. And the fucking sun, I guess, you know, not me. You know, when you phone over here says temperature bump up on it, just shut your. I was running away. I was trying to show it. I had a show in Tony's freezer box. I just should have fucking made the freezer. You should have gave this some fucking bowl of ice. I'm hungry, bro. I'm hungry too. I've got to bring one other thing up. Just for you guys, just I don't know if you guys have seen it. Obviously, you've never grown up and you watch the karate kid, right? The movie? Yes. The original. We're out. Ralph Machia. Have you guys watched on Netflix, the new series, Copa Kai? No. But I know. The Copa Kai takes place 30 years later. It's the same character. It's the guy who Ralph Machia, a fight at the end of the karate kid, the first movie. And it opens up his own. He's not down on his lock. Ever since getting beat up, he losing that fight at the Ralph Machia. And Ralph Machia is a big car dealer and he's got tons of money. And they have all the same. They brought back a lot of the same characters. It's so good. If you want to feel like you're back in the 80s again, you've got to watch this series on Netflix. It's... I can't stop watching. I watched the whole first season in two, two, three days. It's still... It played the same music. You know, the 80s music. It's so well done because it's a spoof really, but it's not. It's serious at the same time. You guys will love this series. And telling you, I promise you, you'll love it. I've seen... Is that a Netflix name? Yes. Copa Kai, I've seen the coming to... Come in to Josh's. What, Jimmy? I'm telling you, if you like the original karate kid watch this thing, you will be in love with this series. Will Smith did it. He's the guy behind it. It's phenomenal. It's been... It's so good. The acting is so... You'll think that you'll feel so nostalgic watching it. But at the same time, it's... It's actually good. It's well done. Yeah, that's all. When I... When I saw it on Netflix, I saw like the coming, you know, when you do the trail of things. Yeah. And the guy's on a floor. He's sleeping on a floor. And he's dreaming about when Machia would knock them down. Yeah. Yeah. And he woke up on the floor. Is that the one? Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. I've got... The kid who played the... The badass in the other movie, who lost the rap music. He's a great actor. He's the best one in the whole series. Is he still a prick? No. But he... Like life beat him up. He was still driving the same like Kamarro. It's like... He's still living in his place. He's like me. He's like you to me. Basically. Life just beat... Life just beat... Life just beat... But then he comes back and he restarts corporate high. And so you got... I don't want to tell you any more, but watch it. It's really good. It's very good. I'm waiting for fast time to reach my eye. Yeah. Exactly. Doing that thing, I post it on Facebook. I'll tell you why it's so good because it's so whoever wrote it. The writers are so smart that they did it. It's mirrored against the old series. It's very similar. Like he's the guy now who's like the loser in Ralph Machu. He was like the guy who's like got tons of money and to deal with ships and you know. And he's living like a wealthy person. So it's like the roles are reversed. It's pretty interesting. It's pretty interesting. That's what I have to say. That's what I have to say. But it's always the tough guys that end up broke. I don't know what it is. When I was in school, all those little little punks. They're like stock brokeies. And they get old now. Women now. Yeah. Yeah. I was the guy when I was young. I was the tough guy. I was the one who's like me first. I got no body. Yeah. I was like me first. I got no body. Yeah. It's like it's like balancing. Yeah. One of life's little just. Yeah. I get up in a morning sometimes I'm like, what the fuck, man? What happened? Yeah. And you got a good life. You're talking about the way the. What a great day. You're going to trick. Do those guys with tricks when they would go arrogant. Box. You were one of those guys. Yeah. I was never a prick. I was never a bad guy. You're a guy. As tough as you are, you're the hearts like 10 times a size. That's what people are real. That's true. That's true. But speaking of drugs. I was always. I was always helpful to people. I really never trashed people. You know, let's say, you know, accept the guys you beat up in the bar when you were drunk. Yeah. What are you always saying? I'm not surprised. What about the guy in line with the DMV? You beat him up too. Yeah.ric list. Yeah. Cool. Yeah.l skip tier. He was close. He was a� got one. He was a trustworthy job. He was or..... ihren realization.

You're not maximizing your time. Yeah. But if I make it, if I do it and can't imagine 10, it's going to look. It's going to look so fresh. That's fresh, John. That's what. You know what I mean. I just as we can visit your things, just higher and more people. That's all. I mean, I'm upset right. Or what you know, you might need to do. You might have to have like batch dates like in other words, when people are going to order, say, okay, on October 1st, I'm going to be producing this many batches of chocolate chip, peanut butter cup and Macadamian chocolate. Those are the only ones we'll have. What you're order is that now. And then we won't produce another batch for two weeks. And then you know what I mean? This way everything gets done in groups, you know. Well, I got people who want to like, so 80% of our orders are re-ordered. Oh wow. 80%. That's great. That's great. That's great. People order order like today. And then full day is later the order like that. Because they know that at the time they get this second order, they'll be done with their first order. So I kind of really, we kind of really good clientele. I mean, I'm growing the way I want to grow. I don't want to have 10,000 orders at once. Because I want to make sure that the product is what it is. No, that is. It's a high-impact fresh. You know. No, it makes sense. Make sense. All right. Well, if people want cookies, they can go to Mr. Pots protein.net. And you can put your orders in for the jumbo Palombo jumbo lights and all the other stuff that Mr. G. sells. For now, there were out of time. Um, day Palombo for John Ramino and Jimmy the bowl. Greg Valentino and Mr. G. We'll see you next week. I'm not sure baby. It's about being pauses. That's right. Dad, all your people put that kind of stuff on the out. I want to tell the people who see that. People who are up to accomplish your dreams. Don't worry.
