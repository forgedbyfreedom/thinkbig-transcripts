No I know what's in my 100% in Chicago because the weight in it was in the afternoon I only have 16 hours for carbob okay because the project in what's next day in the morning so I was completely hard completely dry on the stage so right now we are accused I had it all way Steve he said that I used to need pull my belt more white and the rest I had to keep a lighter and I only had like a one pound two pounds or room for make it up because I weigh one ninety one and my weight limit is one ninety two guys like it wait wait for this to waste until this weekend we increased the food but not in crazy not in crazy because we can pull out of because I don't understand me so right now my weight honestly today my weight was in this summer as well as one ninety five and a hug wow okay so you're you're basically holding yourself at this weight pretty much and I guess you're going to go all the lot all down a little up I mean that's that makes sense do you have any desire to do any other shows or you just shut it down until the Olympia honestly I was thinking in the Chicago Thump Island fixers yeah I think you could jump I think you should jump at the one of them obviously Tampa is as weak and but maybe Texas because it's right in your backyard right there yeah I was thinking in the three shows because it's the reveal so you want to people know you trying to key on a stage the preparation but I thought like Patrick and I thought I might sponsor us Michael and they want me to focus Houston the Olympia because in some point after Chicago I went to some status and I know when to lose that status if I go to another channel I don't think anyone's gonna be I think I think you'd be crazy not to do taxes it's right there you can pretty much drive there and why not collect another paycheck you know because also too we are we like we like a Patrick give me our rest like a little brain we we we take a money stove off of the preparation for led the body on down and saying we push so hard for the Olympia last eight weeks.
