I've been stuffed in your pocket for the last hundred days. When I don't get my bad, I take it out on the sleeves. As soon as I sum your baby, they're full of ball on the hill. I'll polish them rockets down and swallow those pills and say, oh. Space lo and muggle muggle. There's a car in the sea, or now it'll be a collar in the flame. With two doors to cheap, no respect, only one there's your name. You've been drinking my blood, well I've been making your wounds. Well I shave off the pitch now in a scopa Yorking. You'll see my heart. Space lo and muggle muggle. Come. Snow falling above a wave, a drizzle of love tosquaredверs of love. I breathe from life to the sea with notable worth.
