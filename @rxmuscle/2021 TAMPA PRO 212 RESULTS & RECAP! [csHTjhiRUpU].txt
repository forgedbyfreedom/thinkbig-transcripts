Dave Alamo here with an RX muscle news update the Tampa Pro 2012 has led out and we have a new champion, Carruth Bajo, Wednesday event, he is going to the Olympia to his first Olympia and it couldn't be proud of for him because I actually worked with him and he's worked his butt off of his last couple of years, winning his pro-quart at a master's event which a lot of people think doesn't translate to the open division. I knew we had the talent to do it. He's worked his way up the ranks, he plays third, a lot of people 40 couldn't have a little higher in Chicago two weeks ago and I said look you're going to come back, we're going to bring you an even tighter than you were before and that's exactly what we did and he came in, he was probably right around 2-12 for the Chicago pro and I had him down to probably 208-207 because I knew the conditioning was going to be the key factor for who wins this show especially going up against guys like John's here with who's known for his conditioning, almond el de saudi known for conditioning and structure. I know Carruth has tons of muscle on his body, it's put together and it laid out well, he really has no flaws in this physique in terms of gaps and I sit to myself Carruth, you got to come and peel through the ball, he's got a suffer and that's exactly what he did, he did in complaint, he suffered, he dieted, he cardioed, he virtually went, you know, no car is held fact for a couple days just to really bring him out a little drier to bring in every little detail and that's exactly what the doctor ordered for this show because conditioning I think was the winning factor looking at this lineup and looking at the pictures and the videos that were up there because Carruth has a lot of wealth with physically know that but when you bring him on stage and he turns around and hits a bad thubble by step and he's got to loosen hamstrings that's impressive with his physique and his structure and that's what won it for Carruth guys out here. almond el de saudi from the front, you know you see that front double by step of almond and man it is you almost get scared it's so good his waist is so tiny he's got those big arms but I felt it from behind he could have been harder and I think it had he really run it out from behind he could have won this show because he's got a lot of bells and whistles to his physique he's got a lot of wow I really I've been a very big advocate of his physique from day one I think he's going to be great pro he's going to be on that Olympia stage battling it out he's got to bring him better conditioning from behind he's got to bring those glutes and hamstrings ridiculous not just lines but ridiculous and what he does that he's going to be very very dangerous. Boluas look this guy is super impressive we've set up before and he's one shows he he's a guy who you know when you're competing in a lineup you don't want to have to stand next to it because he'll make it look bad but once again he did not bring the levels conditioning from behind that I felt he needed to really take home the victory here. I believe it's hot anyone that's hot for could have won this show. Hi they've been if they're best character with his and his best this year and on this day in this show John's do it he's the guy who's always the most condition guy in the show but he's also the guy but if he doesn't bring the ridiculous conditioning and he only brings good conditioning he can be beaten and I think that's what happened here today he brought a full look rounder look but he gave up a little bit of that insane conditioning that he brings to the stage and maybe he was you know maybe the judge is told to come and forward but I felt he lost a little a little bit of sharpness from especially from behind a little bit even from the front and the abdominal area and I think that's why he wanted to be forth you because he easily could have come in here and won this show he's got the tool set to do it we know that everyone that top fork win a pro show on any given day terror badge however was the man of the night he brought the goods he brought the conditioning and he is going to the Olympia congratulations to character I couldn't be happy if he am my friend and that's going to take us to the end of this little wrap up tomorrow will be the man's open and we will be back highlighting what happens there for now though I am capable of both with an Rx muscle news update
