Hey guys, we're super excited to be here at the LA Fit X-Box, our 30-year-in-a-row, and what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be launching the tasty pastry with a low-car caulk tart, we've got three and four grams of neck carbs, and we love to show this is our best place to be in LA. I'm Dave Palombo, founder of Species Nutrition.

We use only top of the line formulations, toasts for maximum results and the best flavoring systems available. I put my name and reputation on every bottle of Species Nutrition products. If you want to be your absolute best, join the evolution. Dave Palombo here with our ex-Muscle supplement and science. Today we're going to talk about injections and a lot of people have been asking me about this and it's something I wanted to do and talk about for quite a while and I just kept putting it off and finally I guess it came back to me because I wanted one of my clients to ask me a question and they said, look Dave, I took a shot in my glute muscle and when I pulled the needle out, blood shot half way across the room. Another guy sent me an email saying Dave, when I stuck a needle into my tricep, the muscle was twitching like crazy and I had no if I injured a nerve or something like that. Another person said I took a shot of my lat and when I put the fluid in, I got like a shocking burning feeling down my hand and I was whacking it on the table and I'm a little nervous. I think I did some damage. These are very common occurrences that don't happen every single time but they do happen when you inject anything into your body especially when you don't know the anatomy of what you're doing. Even if you know the anatomy sometimes you can do things that just you had bad luck on. Number one thing when you inject into a muscle okay there are vessels that run through these through these muscles that number one provide the muscle with blood, arteries and veins, there's nerves that run through these things that innervate the muscles that enable them to contract according to what your brain tells them to do and these are just constantly running out. You know the anatomy of what's going on you can usually avoid the big vessels but there's always little tiny vessels in there and the big vessels terminate in tiny little what we call capillary beds which are the microscopic blood vessels but when you go through them with a needle okay they bleed. So when you're injecting okay a substance into a muscle and you maybe break some of these vessels in there all the pressure from that substance you're injecting creates back pressure which can cause blood it can cause some of the stuff you're injecting to squirt out okay of the wound and I've talked about this before I've said this ways that you can avoid that that back pressure by kind of moving the skin okay if here's your your muscle you can kind of just move the skin a little bit to the side and then you're injecting then the skin will go back and it will kind of seal off the injection side okay that's one you know thing that happens but I think more so what people are really afraid about it's hitting vessels the question I always get is oh what if I get the needle inside the blood vessel what if I hit a nerve and I damage the nerve very unliked and I'm gonna show you one yes my little I have all these cords all over my studio floor there's no organization okay so there it is so I got one of these cords here I think it's an HDMI cord this if you think about the inside and forget the muscles and everything inside the muscles sit okay your bicep muscle for instance or tricep muscle you have this array of blood vessels running through right the muscle some of these in nerve some of these are artery some of these events it doesn't matter which what they are when you inject when you take a needle yeah let's take our needle here and you actually don't mind needle pet I do this was sent to me by bobby muscles my little needle pet a syringe pet when you take your your syringe and you actually inject through the skin okay you perforate the skin now you have you have to navigate these vessels that you don't even know they're in there okay so most of the time you go in and you and you you don't hit anything and you you put the shot in and you're all good to go sometimes however you take an odd angle shot and you go in rather than go right into the between the vessels you actually hit a vessel now if you're going slow enough in what happens is these vessels are kind of just they're dangling they're they're very loose they're not like they're not really anchored in there so if you hit something they just kind of move out of the way if you're going slow see how this thing is just kind of pushing these cords away and going through them so you might feel a little a little twitch or something or a little a little something you're hitting but eventually it doesn't bother you because these this the syringe is going through and pushing these things out of the way now if you inject too hard very rapidly sometimes you can spear a vessel so instead of it getting move that of the way because it's robbery you actually can pierce it but you're not going to get inside it okay if you pierce something that can cause bleeding okay it pops out if you go slowly and you hit a nerve okay and you and you move it out of the way you might get the muscle twitching a little bit because you're you're actually it's like you're punching the nerve a little bit and the nerve is punching your back that's normal okay that's that's that's normal if you inject this thing too fast and you spear the the nerve which I have never heard anyone do but it's possible you can get a really big backlash now more likely what happens a lot of times is people get in there and they get very close to a nerve then they inject their substance in and as they inject it it starts occupying space and putting pressure on the nerve so all the fluid in there is pressing on this nerve and it causes the nerve to fire I see a lot of guys when they do their lat injections it'll inject they put a lot of fluid in there because it's a big muscle and then it puts pressure on that nerve and then all down there arm they start getting this like shooting pain or this fiery feeling or this tingling there's a lot of different sensations it's not because you damaged the nerve because if you you would have felt it right when you stuck the needle in you're not so much you feel just a little movement in there and then you inject them then all of a sudden you get this burning feeling or that's because you're putting pressure against the nerve now and it's causing the nerve to fire okay and that's not normal obviously now usually the pain goes away although this comfort goes away pretty quickly if it doesn't in the last a few days it's because that fluid is kind of still in that same area and it's near the nerve you might want to massage it a little bit in that area to kind of try to move it around because that's going to take the pressure off the nerve sometimes you know once again if you go too fast you could neck something or damage something it's a little bit and it causes a tremendous amount of inflammation around that area when inflammation occurs massaging is not going to help it might actually irritate it more a lot of times it's just got to heal you could take some anti-inflammatories if it's really bad the pain or uncomfortable that's less likely of a situation or scenario more likely is you're putting pressure around that nerve or vessel because of the fact that you've pumped or pushed a lot of fluid whether we three four or five cc's I don't know how much people put it in nowadays but even putting one cc too close to a nerve and putting pressure on it can be annoying and that's really where it becomes annoying and it can become a nagging a little bit of pain but like I said usually once the oil dissipates in a couple hours or even less than that the pain goes away so it just depends on where you put it but this is this network of vessels is the way it is and once again as long as you go in slowly that's why it's going to be when you put a needle in just go nice and slowly and it will push these vessels out of the way it's not going to spear them you're not going to get inside the vessel you're not going to be injecting oil in your vein or artery it's almost if I asked you to try to do it you probably couldn't do it that's how hard it's these these vessels are very rubbery just like this cord is rubbery it's almost impossible for me to stick a needle into this cord because and even if I hold it tight because every time I do it it just moves out of the way you might once again you might irritate it a little bit but you're not going to not going to get inside these vessels or these you're not going to and you're not going to spear a nerve once again unless you go crazy that's why it always drives me nuts when I go to the doctor's office and they want to vaccinate you and I get this nurse with this long needle that's way too long that they don't absolutely don't need especially in a person like me who has no body fat and they get on my shoulder and they go and they hit you with this needle like at a hundred miles an hour I'm like yo whoa whoa you don't have to put it in that fast oh it'll be over before you know it if I said that's all right I'm so I'm not worried about it being over I can wait five seconds more take your time because I know that if they hit something in there it's gonna hurt and I'm going to be in pain and soar for a couple days from it there's no need to go in that fast you push it nice and slow goes in like a nice little slight butter knife into the thing you push your fluid in in a nice steady pace doesn't have to be super fasty that because if you inject things too quickly to some of them you could put a lot of pressure against these vessels and we don't want that so don't think you you're you damage yourself permanently this is a common occurrence okay and people who do take shots and if you do shots in a regular basis every other day you're gonna take a couple of bad shots here in there take your time go in nice and slow you push your fluid in nice and steady don't use pins that are too small they have to put tons and tons of pressure to try to push it in and don't use pins that are too big either that are gonna damage the tissue when you put it in there and you shouldn't have as many problems it's always when we're rushing or we're trying to do something too quickly or we don't have the right uh instruments or the right syringe size or that's when we have problems so try to eliminate problems by being prepared that's my best advice to you on
