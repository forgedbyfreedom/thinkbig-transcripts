the real run, gedaan with our Brian Helderman with our Exmuscle.com, event number six for the weekend, event number two for today, events are back, our winner of the five event medley press and deadlift. Absolutely brutal. Thank you. Thank you. We're well and training and I knew that not wearing any straps would be key. So grip strength came in and helped me win this event. Yeah, not too many guys grab the axle without straps today. Yeah, it's definitely helped speed up my tongue. And your tremendous tremendous pressure. So it was I was fully expected to see what you did out there with your presence. Thank you. I appreciate absolutely a look terrific. Go back and rest it and hopefully we'll see you again here in the next one. Good. Brian Helderman with our Exmuscle.com.
