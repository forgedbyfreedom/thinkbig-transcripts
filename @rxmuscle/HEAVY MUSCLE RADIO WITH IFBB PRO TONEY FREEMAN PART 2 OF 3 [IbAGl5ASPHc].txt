Right now you you're always dressed well to where do you get your clothes because I don't have a big guy like you could actually fit in such you always have design a clothes on you always look like you pick your outfits out to match. It's just you know I take my time because it's number one it's impossible or you should be impossible for me to go to the mall and you anything you know I would always have to go get the relax field of bag you fit and you know like you know three sides of two big and then go get this way taken in and all that stuff of recently I found this place called K&G then big and tall and I'm actually Sean John has some wide laid slacks that they made the 100% really nice slacks they do book you got them off the rack I got every color yeah actually they you know I can kind of get them all to the perfect perfect but the fact that I can put them all the legs and I'm not gonna actually wear my belt without you know bunch of them all up looking at all crazy you know same fit the all of the should be like custom you know just be you know maybe a half inch in the length of maybe inch in the waist but normally I'd get like six seven inches in the waist you should have a pocket are and touch each other by the time they take your waist and I had this one lady who can make it look right but I mean yes but there's one for her then the pocket would be touching well I don't even know what I would do I would just wear you know there's almost really big my the bill is just wear baggy clothes and click so yeah you know you make a concerted effort though to address yourself and I think that's why people command a little more respect for me maybe well I mean you got it like okay the thing about us you know like in football they wear the uniform and the helmet stuff so we don't really get to see that face in our sport we're down to our skisys yeah so pretty much you know saying you can see the person and if they inshaped the out of shape so when we're not on stage you kind of got to give them something else and that's why I kind of like this you know put on the nice clothes and that way you're you're complete you're not just you know you know but I'm needed you're kind of more balanced and people are attracted to that do people come up to you in the in stores and stuff like that and try to like you know if there have been like go off for movie parts or anything like that or commercial work or because I mean you do stand out when people see they think that you're someone important I can see that I had a lot of movie industry people come up to me as a booth and and that latest past we've been so I'm making some connections that way but I'm right now I'm actually reading for part in this movie called Justice Knights I just got my the second act where there's for my my character is and I've been you know the one who we have been in the summer called Park so I'm starting to hate that direction I really enjoy acting you know I made the guy who's writing justice might he I made him in the spy and he said you know I might as a movie and I got his character you'd be perfect for him so he wrote me into the movie and they actually got me written into part two as well so I'm well looking forward to that okay does that the idea of getting my head a camera like that make you nervous it all since it's something like you haven't really done too much well you know I took I'm all too high school I mean I think I had acting experience but I've had experience being in plays in reverse and lines and stuff like that being in front of you know live people and then you know being on stage is a bodybuilder you have to perform I mean I guess you don't have to but if you want to be successful you can want to have fans you have to learn out of the form and you have to know how to control your emotions you know I've turned it on and turned it off so you know I got I'm not saying I'm a great actor anything but I know that there's a lot of guys out there doing it and if they can do what I can do that's pretty much right I'm sure that's the right out of two to have you know people I've been on movie sets obviously people don't realize a lot of times also when movies are filming sequence and not film like the whole thing in one shot so it does they do to begin the end first and then go do yeah you don't have to remember the whole script although I'm terrible memory I sometimes see some of these scenes with these guys speaking like you know 25 30 lines at a time I don't know how these guys actually can possibly remember all the lines but I guess it's crazy when I did that movie park you know he said me I had a pretty good significant park and so he said me the script and he said well the first day we shoot we're gonna do these pages right here so he gave me like I don't know four five pages and I had you know like 10 lines to do so I'm reading and studying and reading and reading and I go to the set and then he's like oh well I'm sorry we're not doing that we're doing this you're missing and I'm just like Ryan I don't even know I don't even know what the best thing is I was making ready to go home while I don't know what to do if I'm not going to be fine this read over you know I'll go on so I read over it and it was a it was a scene where I'm gonna go off and I'm coming to the club to collect money from the couple of old hours old me money and I'm like well I mean I think I'm been in that situation the time of two before so say I can do it so I've needed my mail there's an airbody and it's tripping it's like wow I do that was really good so from that moment I was just like really good I was like I think I'm on my new passion my new you know things you did in the thing that drive me to you know you better and better it's off you see you like the acting and that's good that's I love it it was really really cool now what minute you grew up in a tough neighborhood you said you had some experience with that um well just do life period life experience you know something you know I worked in the clubs you know they've been around the bottle for you dancing the club still you yeah I made you know I was a bodyguard you know back in the late 90s I mean late 80s early 90s Atlanta was like you know one of the drunk capital of the nation and it was a tons of Kingpins and maybe in there good news in Atlanta and it's coming to the club that I worked in all the times I should be security for those guys so I'm seeing a you know what I mean I know a lot of those time being there run through them so that's that's interesting I got you know that about you yeah it's kind of crazy but it's not like from 80s to 87 to 92 crazy club 112 people listen and they probably been there they know what's up it's good off the chain off the Rickness 20 out of the time stage you know I mean you know they've changed the whole area bucket they've revitalized the whole thing it's all up as buildings you know it's like an interesting history older like a never and I get never existed talk to me a little bit about though we got some you're gonna be competing a little later in the area and usually you compete all throughout the year you kind of this year kind of limited to the second half of the year I think what are you gonna do the first show is gonna be in June yeah I wanted to just focus on my business and focus on you know I didn't know I chose and that takes a total of your body so I just want to make sure that you know I get top of all my you know I'm a little bit of a tablet and runs past like that you end up burning through a lot of vitamins and minerals and enzymes and satiacis I just want to take time to let my body rebuild that all that stuff back up before I started dieting again so June Toronto Pro show looks good and then Chicago and July and then I'll see after that you know I'm like to do a few shows so but I'm gonna see just how those first to go and take it from there. Do you like the new rules where you have to win a show to qualify for the Olympia? I mean because you've obviously every year you pretty much want to show so for you it's probably not that bad but you like the idea that they're making it more selective. Well I definitely feel like you'd leave just only be on the stage and not taking nothing to give anybody else but I'm saying after around 10 to 12 are being announced as far as the interest so you know maybe cut it off at 15 but you know they're 16 pro shows so if you take away the the guys who qualify at the old and the guys who qualify at the Arnold. So you have to win so that leaves you know maybe 14 more guys besides the guys that qualify and then someone old guy that's gonna do someone old show that's gonna take it down another few places so we're gonna get to have that number of the top 10 to 15 you do you guys on stage and then I feel like everyone should be able to you know we should be able to compare everyone and then really put everybody you know then it'll be a better show for everybody I think and they're hopefully yeah well I think you're right I think that the you know really at the Olympia level no one really cares about the guys who actually had any show no one cares about the guys who play eighth place and down usually it to it's like alright get them off the stage we want to see these top seven or eight guys compare to see who looks the best and you know really at the Olympia it's the elite of the elites you really shouldn't you should really only have or 10 or 12 guys to begin with and so this is probably a good thing is gonna be less expensive for them to fly all these people in you get a more time to compare the people and I hear they're gonna be you said they're getting to begin with more prize money I think too right well if you freeze up more prize money what they do with it you know we'll see but the robin said that well that was the number one objective if we say if you you know say like 90 grand if there's like 10 less people in the show or something like that then you said they would put that towards a prize money first so I'm like well I mean that can only be good yeah I don't they don't give it all to the first place dude they're exactly exactly what I would do so to do that now you and I also talked off camera a little bit and I like to say you had this this idea to possibly you know make bodybuilding almost like you know the order racing industry you know like I like a point system tell me about that a little bit golf NASCAR all the sports like ours which you know basically are individuals and you might have a team we might we have gurus and sponsors and stuff so but the point system you get excellent a point for victory first second third for us this maybe and then you know it colders up over the year and that's how you're rank and then when you get to the limpio according to your rank that's how the call out should be and I mean I mean then it's been a surreal battle with the real five people who have earned their positions and nothing got around you know I'm saying people have put him to work they done the shows you know to got their points and no one can take him away from it then it's more I think it gives people more incentive to do better do more shows get to point I mean you know okay if they throw some of this extra pride in money on if you're re-prepared to my points I don't know it's all kind of ways to make it interesting but the thing about you know golf very few people follow golf back in the day not a guy's stadiums right I mean I got 20,000 30,000 people at a govt and you know coming for real so I mean that's because they've made it really legitimized they made it interesting so you're saying this if you get a point system it would encourage more body bills to do more shows because you wouldn't necessarily have to win but the most more point you accumulate that the better you're ranking will be toward the as the year comes to an end when you come to the Olympia and so what would you say like a certain amount like maybe top 12 point getters would qualify for the Olympia? Well I mean they could steal you know let's just say the whole you got to win a show thing works but there's only like eight guys that one shows and then you can then you know four more guys from the old in the Arnold lineup so that's 12 guys like that so they could say happy with 12 been cool but you should open it up toward the guys who didn't win a show but they have X amount of points or over X amount of points maybe you can add them to the show you know I'm saying because some people one way or another somebody to get in that down yeah you either if even they're not gonna win a show they're gonna get seconds like two or three times and you know I'm saying they would be deserving to go and won't be going or maybe the year you give away the top point earner you know gets a special you know championship prize like you know super series prize or something like that for you know being a little consistent because when the Olympia doesn't mean you'd have the most points because you might have someone else who outpoint you because they won the Arnold they won when you're pro or you know something like that. Well yeah and then I'm sure that some company would love to be the sponsor of that right I mean that would be a very prestigious award right so you know I mean that would be incredible.
