We are at the Tampa Bay Powerhouse gym and this is a new gym and I'll be going to you regularly and you can see there the stairs, that's the event speech stairs. In here we have the rock wall kind of like the concrete walk wall and Darial gains that she's going to show us and demonstrate the wall climb. Go ahead Darial, don't fall now. If you do I've got a captured here on video. They call her Darial Spider-Woman Gaines. Here she goes. Keep going, you could do it. Darial. All right, you want to try to go to the side? No. Don't fall. Don't hurt yourself. Oh. All right, come on down, you're scared of me now. This is after a monster chest workout people. It's not like she's fresh or anything. Good job. Take a bow. Very nice.
