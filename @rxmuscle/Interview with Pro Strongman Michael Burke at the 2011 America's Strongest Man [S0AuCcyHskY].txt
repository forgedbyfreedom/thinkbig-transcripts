Lol. Brian Hill to Brad with rxmuscle.com. Let's have a fel stone. Mike absolutely tremendous. 400 pounds stone. You had a tremendous pick. Tell me, tell me about it. You know, I did the same event in the Arnold and I picked it like everybody else was picking it and it didn't go very well. And I trained with Brian Shaw. So he changed the way I grabbed it. He showed me how to grab it his way, which is the way you guys saw with one hand underneath and I feel real comfortable with this event and I came here planning on winning this event. This is one of my strong events. So, I'm good. Yeah, you're just a little bit gas right now to Mike's shouting over the top of us, but you had a tremendous performance. 120 sum of feet, way out past everybody. Terrific. You're moving on now, the fourth event tonight, the wheelbarrow, the truck wheelbarrow behind us. And how, what are you thinking about that? You're gotten a gas left? Ah, you know my hamstrings are cramping up. So we'll see what happens. And I haven't trained this event. First of all, I've ever even done this event or even touched it. So we'll see how it goes. I'm hoping to maintain, be middle of the pack. So, and are you guys using straps for this event or no? Right, yes, we are. They're allowing it and I'm using them. Yeah, I don't blame it. But yeah, gotta have them. All right, Mike Burke, the winner of the Hoosefell Stone tonight, the America Strongest Man, will be back shortly with a wheelbarrow. Until then, Brian Hill to Brown with RXMuscle.com.
