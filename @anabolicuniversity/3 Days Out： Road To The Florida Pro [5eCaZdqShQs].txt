Worry! You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. Kion, I are driving to Florida. This is the first 10 minutes of the journey. We are only two hours behind schedule, which is pretty much what I anticipated. I didn't expect to have to be on time, but he was. And then I plan on using the grill to make the chicken, so I could pack the car, load the car up while the chicken was grilling, but I ran on a propane. So for everything that can go wrong, when you're moving, that have one thing going on, we're good. That out of six or seven hundred little things to take with us, I have a 20 day supply of one thing when I get a 30 day supply. As usual, my car is being a bitch. I try to put it in an autopilot while I'm talking to you and it can tell I'm not paying attention to it. So it's being a needy little bitch. What I understand is why this thing doesn't have grunk built in yet. Like he has his own AI and the car works off of the AI, but it doesn't work off the AI that he has. It doesn't make my sense to me. So we're going to listen to Dominic Cousa's program for peak week. It's Dominic's my coach and I'm in peak week. I think we're four days out. Yeah. And how many hours do we have to drive? 23 hours at this time of the day. So the plan is not about 12 hours today and knock out 12 hours tomorrow and show up a day early. I booked the room for the third but today's the first and we don't need to be there to the fourth. So as usual, I am over prepared because if you're not early, you're late and if you're not over prepared, you're under prepared. And redundancy is the key to victory. So I've got like multiple things. The only thing I only have one of is posing trunks, which is a poor planning on my parachute, awarded additional poses and trunks. I have 12 new body building trunks, but I only have one classic physique post-junctions. And I didn't bring any of my body building post-junctions which was stupid because none of the shows I'm doing have an open division. So if I don't make way, I just don't get to compete. There's not like I can overflow from class akin to 12 like last year. There's no overflow. But I'm 179.1 this morning and I'm pretty sure my weight my weight cut off is 82 but if for some reason I shrunk by a tenth of an inch then it's 177. So we're planning on 177 and if as soon as I get a height at 64.1 we're good because the way it works is you would get height at three times and they take the highest height. So that's why I'm doing three shows. This is as long as I get a height at one time at 64.1 then when we do the Detroit Pro in February the real show then I will be able to come in at 182 and I'll look much better. But we're doing this whole season is just to bring me in at 177 so that I can guarantee at least one because we have to get you have to weigh in successfully three times. If I go say I come in at 64.0 and I'm 179 I don't get to compete and it doesn't count as one of those three. But once you've weighed in once you've been heighted in three times and one of those times is 64.1 then for the rest of my life my weight cut off is 182 unless they raised the weight cut off. But I'm in the five category not the five four category and I've been heighted at 64.1 every year for the last 10 years because even though I've never competed in classic I always height myself to make sure I'm 64.1 just to be on the safe side if I ever did switch to classic. Just until recently they raised the weights by seven you know it would have been 165 and I'm weighing in at 178 it would never would have worked. So now that they've raised it to 177 and I weighed in at 176 last year I was like fuck I should have just unclassed and that's the whole reason so we're doing the Florida Pro on the 6 then two weeks later doing the San Antonio Pro on the 20th and then a week later doing the Daytona Pro on the 27th so it made more sense to drive down to Florida and then drive to Texas and then drive back to Florida and spend a month down south then it did defy because flying the two of us five different times and renting a car would have been 15,000 bucks once it's all sudden done whereas this way we pay nothing for airfare you pay nothing for car rental and all I have to do is pay the Airbnb or the hotel so what I've learned is the downside to the Airbnb is chaos since most of these Airbnb's there's always something wrong and if you get an extended stay hotel with a kitchen and multiple bedrooms it's still cheaper than the Airbnb with two advantages you do have a communal washer and dryer you don't have to use the hotel's wash service which would you normally with a normal hotel and most importantly there's always a fitness center so I can get my fast and cardio in and if I'm doing something like arms I can just do it at the hotel with the cables, delts and arms can be done at the hotel so I can get an arm pump the day of the show and or the fast cardio the day is leading up to the show it's much more convenient plus you don't have to worry about random parking situations like an Airbnb if you're going to be at one Airbnb for a couple weeks then the ad makes sense but if we're going to be getting the Sarasota staying in Sarasota for six to seven days then driving to San Antonio and we're going to stop in New Orleans and we're going to stop in Houston then we're going to head up to Dallas then we're going to head down towards San Antonio hitting all those Airbnb's would be too confusing it's better off just staying at a home's two every time or something equivalent to a home's two it's gonna be a lot of fun we're gonna I'm not putting pressure on myself to win the goal is to make weight and get heighted at 64.13 times goal two is to have Dom learn my body peaking me so that he's better prepared to peake me when it matters which is the Detroit Pro when people can actually come see me in my hometown. Priority three is to perfect my posing and so priority four Kai can get the first ever recorded posing routine of me since even though I've been doing this 17 years there's never been a good recording of my posing routine with the music. I got the right from the band to be able to use the music so we don't have to worry about copyright because most of the people when they put their posem machine up and once it's tear and shruff and they don't actually have the posing music to the right music so it just looks fucking retarding. It doesn't make any sense to me like the posing has to be executed with the music now I know with a bodybuilding a lot of the bodybuilders they just wing it to some cool music and they like the song and it's not really choreographed but I ain't doing that shit not for classic I'm gonna take it seriously and I've choreographed this routine now they've neutered my routine and they cut it down from 90 seconds to 60 seconds because I don't know why but I've got a 90 second routine and if they cut the music off top shit I'm just gonna keep fit I'm gonna finish routine out because by the time they cut the music off it'll be 75 seconds then I just have 52 more poesis to do and I can rip through it a little bit faster but I've got the posing down pretty good next priority is to create a lot of great content with some cool people so my plan is on the way back from Sarasota to New Orleans stopping in Tampa and trying to get a training session in with Joe Bennett in New Orleans doing some you know horror tours like vampire and rice tour checking out Lafayette cemetery two or three because one's closed checking out some cool shit in New Orleans then in Houston I've got two or three patient slash clients in Houston I want to see plus Terran slives there you might want to do a training video hunter lives there you know the chances of me lining it up perfect is pretty low Logan Franklin's competing with me at the Florida Pro I'll ask him if he wants to give a training session in Houston you know and try to get back had the stuff done then in Dallas I'm supposed to train with Luke Miller and I'm gonna try to see if piano fit me in or Sean Clarita and of course I'm playing it by ear I haven't reached out to anyone yet because I don't know what days I'm gonna be there and then I did get a chance you it it's gonna do some content with me after the San Antonio Pro because he lives in San Antonio and after the Daytona Pro I'm driving up to Arkansas to shoot some content with Carlos Thomas Jr and if I can talk high and his girlfriend into it I'll probably will drive to the Olympia from Arkansas so we can hit the Olympian Vegas because we got all our shit like what difference a fucker make and I brought a lot of medicine so that I don't have to stop but get anything along the way and roll out to my seat wants to have me on his podcast when we're in Vegas then I need to make it back to Detroit in time for the third week in October because I'm getting a second here transplant the back of my head this time got the front of my head done and I liked it so much I'm gonna get the back of my head done because let's face it in classic you have to be one not ugly to have a small waist and three have hair I can't think of a single ugly classic guy a bald classic guy or a classic guy with a big waist and you're like but Todd if you're ugly and bald and have a big waist why don't you just stay in 212 it's because I'm only 176 I'm not growing and it's like you know guys a lot of people look oh this guy uses so much gear look how much he that's why I tried it is like nothing's working after three years of not growing between 2020 and 2020 to 3 I just said fuck it and we dropped the hammer and used a ton of GH and a ton of gear and my face grew extra skin like a sharp hay but I didn't get any more muscle so there's no fucking point to using more gear and guaranteed I know for a fact more food just makes me fat or more gear just makes my organ sicker that whatever the reason and then this year I used last year last GH that what I used to use was sort of 5.5 grams and 8 units of GH and I didn't push the food because of Alice theory that would be covering the autopsy and baldking video and I made more progress this year in a recomp phase with Dom on arms and lads then I did in the previous year blasting here so it's really all comes out of training training is way more important than food or gear so I strongly disagree with pub or nuts believe that gear is more important than training I think that that doesn't make sense to me because if you don't train your legs and you just train your arms to take a bunch of gear even if the gear works you're just going to grow arms whereas if you need legs you need to train the legs so the training is what matters because the training and the volume of the training and the quality of the training determines where you're going to grow now maybe you need gear too grow but after a more gear even if it did work it would grow everything equally including your waist and then as your waist gets bigger everything else looks smaller so the most important thing about your whole body is how small your waist is so it's circling back you're sending it to a transplant of hair to the back of your head right where is that coming from like I think you've been making me clarify this the donor set is the lower back of your head near your neckline okay and I'm putting it on the crown which is the top of the back of my head so you're worried about the scalp condition what's your condition? because you have that thing oh so if I didn't if I had a nice looking head like Chase or Paul I would or Kurt I would have just shaved my head or John Guit I don't have a problem with the ball of head look but I've got this disease where my I have swirls of scalp and it looks disgusting so unless I got tattooed to make it look even uglier and then just look scary and monstrous which I might do when I get older then what is it West Watson? what is this? yeah basically it looks so uglier I'd have to get like a spider web on my head and it's just not you know like it's not that bad but I hate when people take shots of you for because they act like it's like the act like it's a product of steroids or GH when it's like it's just something you've had to do if for a long time right it's that it's a it's a disease where you keep growing scalp and so where the scalp gets thick the hair dies and where the scalp isn't thick the hair is there so I have like these furrows like a grand canyon imagine if the grand canyon was full of hair and that's when my scalp looks like so if I shave my head it looks gross because it's this and I know this because when I got the transplant I shaved my head people would comment about how disgusting my head looked when I was walking down the um I was at the Arnold like a couple days after my hair transplant and people were just complaining like look how ugly that guy's head is and I couldn't wear a hat because it was too soon after the surgery so I had to walk around where there's thousands of people and I hadn't lifted in a couple weeks so I looked fat and soft and small and I had this or was you yeah limpier or something and people were commenting about how ugly the back of my head is and someone behind me was saying like dude can you switch you to me I don't want to look at this bad guy's disgusting head do that's so so I know I can't get away with the shaved head I have to have hair transplants I don't have a choice and I've tried everything and people are like oh in the Manthree I know mother fuckers my dad was bald by 30 my grandfather is bald by 30 I kept all my hair until I was 39 and then I listened to a coach who had me run a really aggressive cycle of stuff in between a six-month period between shows and it would normally the last week of extreme drug use blasts at seven weeks and that's high loss my hair so it was a combination of a ton of drugs and anti-estrogens and just to give you some context I had been having a lot of hair falling out the blast month because of the wind straw going in and the estrogen coming down and so that's how I lost my hair the first time and that's how I was starting losing here again this time I'd been on as much as 400 master in a day no hair was falling out but she put me on 50 wind straw and bring my estrogen down to single digits and my hair starts falling out so believe it or not I am more educated than you I am more experienced than you I do know what I'm doing and this is what the truth is for me now that is a mean that you won't lose hair with master on but I've never met a reliable credible person that lost hair with master on they are always doing other drugs nobody is ever just had zero drugs and went on a thousand master on and had their fallout that they were on 500 test and they didn't replace 500 test with 500 master on they added 500 master on to the 500 master on bound of the s h b g bumped off the d h t the d h t storm made hair shedding and then they just panicked and pulled out all the master on and that's okay I understand that they've got a very simple view of life it's kind of like when a dog's playing with a ball and then it drops the ball and it rolls under the refrigerator and starts scratching it through a refrigerator because it wants the ball back because if it scratches at the dirt outside it's able to dig and get to things but if it doesn't understand you can't scratch a refrigerator because it reproduces about a metal not dirt and that's basically like the intellectual level of the people I deal with when they're trying to tell me how I am about from a college you are now I'm going to be going to say that's arrogant that's arrogant in the sense that you find it offensive because I'm saying something that makes you feel bad about your intelligence and you're going to come up with an insult to beat me because you don't like what I said because I hurt your feelings examine that examine it and you'll understand that you're reacting to your feelings and lashing out and it is what it is well especially because you're not necessarily talking about that individual right if they choose to identify that way that's kind of on them yeah it's not like I'm saying to let some talking to them in Larry like hey Larry you've got the brains of a German shepherd actually no you're more in bread like a beijon you've got the brains of a beijon yeah that would be offensive you specifically yeah Larry this is just you Larry you're fucking more on your subhuman Larry now I can now listen to you like what a dick I don't like totally fokin the air with the red hot poker you know like but like if I'm just like dude I've had my head a long time I know what makes the hair fall out of it and what doesn't and master I mean it well people act like you've never done anything but master on it's like the master on you yeah oh my god like just because you came around yeah it doesn't mean that that was like that'd be like if they came home and I'm sitting on the couch with their mom and they thought the only woman I ever fucked was their mom it's like dude I get your sister too how do you think I'm much your mom Larry I did not fuck your mom or your sister it's a joke not a dick don't take it so hard earlier you said you're posing routine did they cut you specifically down from 90 to 60 or is it everybody yes they're like totally yeah like fuck you we don't like that core go fuck yourself you're gonna get that out from 90 to 60 it sounded very personal but they said because of the anticipated magnitude of master's competitors we probably won't have individual routines at pre-judging and the few people who do get to do their night routines will be reduced to 60 seconds okay so that was why we're gonna do a photo is at the pre-judging right and then yeah actual video later on right all right as we don't need video pre-judging we there's the live stream for that it's just not as interesting the first Tuesday Wednesday Thursday of every month is one enrollment opens okay so you're watching this if his comes out by Thursday go to J3 University you can google it google's a really great thing you should try that you don't need direct links J3 University and then in role and make sure you use the co-top 5 so that I actually get paid I know I'm being that brazen about it but you would not believe the amount of stupid motherfuckers that will reach out to me and ask me about J3 University I spend a long time selling it to him then they go on and don't use my code and I was like you mother fucker oh other good stuff we're doing the prototype for a bit of a circle friends you right now a bit of a circle friends you use an energy drink a lot of people bitch and moan oh my god I think it's period is named can't feed and I might actually grow some muscle so I keep on with an energy drink so you fucking cooked out methods have something to get high on and it is just clean energy like I don't get chittery I don't get angry I don't I just feel great and extroverted while I'm on it unlike coffee which makes me feel like shit this feels awesome and I've used it a few times over the past year and it's I've loved it every time today is the most I've ever used in my life it's a full serving what about you how you dig in love I'm liking it I'm thinking it might be a good idea to release a nasal spray version just to kind of rub it up I don't know if we could legally do that I mean I just give him a straw with the powder I would and just go ahead why even bother with the spray just and it comes with a straw and then you can just snort it right off of the countertop and have a heart attack like rich manna yeah a lot of people think he died from a steroid theory cumin in it is a zero zero zero play at plaque in his arteries he had a coronary vasospasm from snorting pre-workout is 5150 according to his girlfriend it wasn't okay they also found cocaine in his place okay well she told the whatever originally she told the pyrrhetics was cocaine then when it got out that she said that she said no I was mistaken it was pre-workout so the official story is that he died from snorting his own pre-workout and yes RIP I like rich I never dislike rich I'm not disparaging rich I'm just I whenever I think about snorting pre-workout I think of rich piano having our attack and I'm just like yeah I don't want to snort pre-workout or anything else didn't she snort halo right before walking on stage that was before rich died oh okay I didn't like all this we're gonna go up from a lot of showover no no and I did it to intimidate the other people I didn't do it for the effect of the halo they're like what is that I'm like a halo what do you do with it all crushed up and I snorted it I was like now I'm gonna fuck everyone up and I started flexing and pumping like posing and I was shredded that ear and so it drove up the court is all of all my competition so they got softer and I got harder that's how the halo worked with mind control and you're like well why did you use halo one just you sugar I'm looking for try to snort sugar I'm not gonna say snort halo and not snort halo like I'm gonna say I did something I don't know do it the Vicky Vicky is gonna make a video like no it only deducted a tautly he was for 1400 trend a week he also snorted halo and it's like I used 1400 trend in one week one time and never did it again because it didn't help and I snorted halo one time and it's like man he lies like the truth thinking he's looser for everybody ends up just coming across the bridge I just love that he runs burner accounts and comments on anything of like like all the videos that I'll put out of like you won't receive a bunch of others he just comes on saying something that affected like all these people are idiots all these people are like just coming out of fucking nowhere I really miss that guy Victor Black like he really put out some great information because they really just propping himself up in all these comments that are all coming from one account but it's so expensive he'd be for that only out of nowhere before he made his course he watched my course then when he told me he watched my course to be polite I paid for his course then he made a post about how Dr. Todd Lee watched his course and that's where I got all my material from and he put my the receipt of with my real address up and I'm like dude that's doxy me you're pretty madra but he's like that's a business address I'm like mother fucker I know what address it is it's mine my business address is my house take it down right now or go to jail and so he took it down I'm surprised he's a good down he was doxy me yeah like he's got a sign on his house this is Victor Black school of blackitude or whatever it's like it's not like I can't get on a plane and fly to Thailand and settle this he's not in hiding he's not looking to some have been locked and living in a spider hole and Afghanistan he's got a fucking giant building with his name on the side of it and fucking Thailand where there's no laws you're in a fray of his uh his bike again oh my god so this is one person I mean I would hate his bike or game to help me it's like all right guys your your Victor's friends he has like are you this much of his friends is like I want you to hold them I'm gonna give him some of the grab like a wrench and I'm like I'm gonna give some dental work for him to Victor so he's missing teeth I'm gonna even him up so he can get some uh dentures put in this is a joke I'm not really gonna fly out to Thailand and smash Victor's face and with a wrench but to be fair he's gone really far I mean the whole Victoria Black thing right I was in Chicago and I just saw all that shit blowing up my phone of when he was impersonating a woman named Victoria Black trying to like bait you into some weird which was so funny he's like I'm in an arbor mission and I'm like oh really that's like 40 minutes from my house and that was it that's all I said I didn't say we should get up we shouldn't try to train together and then say we should get coffee and he put it up like look at Todd Lee's a creeper trying to seduce women and then Paul just let him have it like that was the last drop Paul like just let him the fuck up and then I talked to cream about it and I was like was there something creepy about what happened he's like she's like always the polar opposite of creepy he was almost trying to put himself out there and you just ignored it like there's no way you could have handled the situation any better you were polite and disinterested I don't know sometimes I just get caught up on the entertainment value of his accounts it's just it just reads so heavily into like the meth head paranoid territory it's see I'm wildly entertaining I can't help it but respond and then he cuts my responses pit posted as a new post and then misrepresent what I say it's like Victor says what I say and misrepresent the way that Kurt misrepresent scientific finding like oh this is a shorter half life therefore it's more anabolic it's like and here's the proof and it's like and people are dumb and they're like oh I don't understand what you said except for that at trend and half that's an athlete's more anabolic so must be true because I just heard it and it's like no no there's no fucking evidence that a higher peak equals more anabolic effect even if you even if the higher peak was a stronger anabolic signal in the absence of more conversion of DHT and estrogen then you would still have a lower area into the curve because of the crash but the peak really results in more conversion of DHT and that's jadelle which means you're getting less total test under the curve and the proof of that is how people's total test goes up if they switch to daily injection for me the whole testcipient aid versus an antheth thing I don't know like it's interesting when you guys when you dive into like the nitty gritty of it you actually draw the comparison but functionally I always feel like who gives a fuck to some extent if I ran out of sipping it and I had an antheth I feel like I would just use that because eventually it's going to be the same fucking thing the astras are similar enough yeah it's 70% toss with her one and 69% of tests for the other and you have a slightly more sought tooth with an athlete but you won't feel the difference between sipping an athlete it was never tangible for me but his theory thatcipient aid doesn't isn't used because of the advising ring is so stupid because anybody could just look at their blood work and see that home when I didn't use test I had a 200 and when I do use testcipient aid I have a 1500 clearly it's working and he never brought up that study ever again after I raked it over the cold on Instagram like I just trashed the shit out of that study and never brought it up ever good it just feels like it was going for low hanging fruit from a tree that people just don't give a fuck about just to try and make a point well I think trying to make a sure up shit because he saw how big of a deal I made when I went master on versus premo yeah that's so clear for him he was trying to get a sipping a versus an athlete is trying to go for an easy one but an easy one that's that or no it's it just seems completely different comparing comparing to long acting extras versus comparing to completely different compounds I don't know all right just what's another topic you want to cover well how are you feeling today we haven't really touched on that inside from the energy I know you've got the berserker yeah I was really tired the last four days those waking up for you so I just kept going the gym on an empty just doing a protein shake going the gym just so I could get them workouts done and it was going good all the way up until Sunday yesterday where I was dragged I meant to take some berserker before I went to the gym so I could be alert and I had a really hot even though Saturday I had a really easy leg workout and I went amazing and you know how I was doing the sissy squats but when my butt went back I would have board the set yeah I just let my butt go back and I got 12 more rough doing I was still like my heels weren't touching I was just doing them a regrossed way so I got 10 reps the hard way and then 12 more reps the easier way but my heel still wasn't touching so I got way more upper lateral quad stimulation and then I went over to the the pendulum squat and it was amazing it didn't hurt my knees at all so not only did I come up with a way of making that sissy squat more efficient because I can turn it into a drop a regrussian drop set and get twice as many reps and now have another great tool to get the upper lateral quad because those the pendulum squat really hit the lateral quad that way when I did that way so and now that doesn't mean I could do the pendulum squat first and get no knee pain or get the same response but I certainly could follow my sissy squat slash heels off hacksquat two sets with two sets of pendulum and then finish off with two sets of leg extensions and just get six sets every four days rather than four sets every two days so I think my Saturday or slash Sunday leg workouts when we get back are going to be amazing and I know exactly how I'm going to train one more down we're going to do and because you know absolute recum yeah they've got all panata they've got new tack they've got so many great brands I've never used a panata like extension I never used a banana leg curl I've never used a panata hack squat I've never used a panata pendulum squat so I'm really excited to use the equipment there and it doesn't have to be complicated I could do a panata leg curl panata sissy squat hacksquat and regression set then I could do panata seated leg curl then a pendulum squat and then add doctor and then leg extension so four sets of hamstrings two sets of add up to six sets of squats and I might recover and when as soon as we recover from leg is just headed again and in the interim we just go upper one day arms next or I might go just back and just and then you know I do back and then the transition is rear toe superset pat deck and then finish with presses and then be done with it and then the next day going into try set by set supersets with the IGF one yeah and then finish with middle doubles just to spread the volume out a little bit so as that's till keep you on two rest days awake or you down to one so it would be it'd be like back and chest delton arms and then it'd be legs then it'd be off so it eating legs every four days but if my legs aren't recovered I would just like if my legs aren't recovered when we come down to legs again take the off and then the next day so it might go like upper arms off upper arms legs off and that's seven did she it legs once every seven days this is it once every four days but it's I'm getting to hit the quads from different all three of the best ways possible my legs grew the best when I was hitting legs every five days with three sets of leg extension two sets of hacksquads four sets of leg curls three sets of adductors and three sets of caps every five days they grew great like that it was until I went to twice a week lecturing but at the same time I dropped my rep range is because that's a Paul Carter advised that's when I got a tour my ad doctor tore my hamstring and then tore my quad I just got so good with those high reps and now using junecky style of training and milking the negative is totally different than controlling the negative it's so much more efficient and I used to do that anyway on the second set like usually by the thing you do the second set you're feeling every man or second of the whole set eccentric and concentric in the target muscle so you're getting like half as many reps but you could just do because you're chasing the logbook for the first set on the second set you don't give a fuck about the logbook you're just trying to go for feel now I just go for feel on every set and I just keep a record of how it went and if I'm really making progress the logbooks just progress and not chasing the logbook the logbook is just a record and then it should be progressing otherwise you're doing too much volume or you're not sleeping enough or you're not eating enough or you're not enough care and then since I got back from LA and I've been training like that I didn't even decrease the weight I didn't even really decrease the reps intentionally but now I'm doing more weight for more reps and before LA but I'm doing it with them more controlled and not that I didn't have control before but I have a way more control because I'm not exploding in the concentric controlling the negative I'm squeezing the concentric and then we're anti-squeezing a reverse squeezing the negative and then in the stretch position I'm not relaxing it to the stretch position I'm going to the point I'm increasing the joint angle to the maximum point before I lose tension but I'm still maintaining tension holding it for a full second and then squeezing it up again and using the semi roller under the heels on the axe what is so hard to keep it there versus just doing this as he squat with the axe what it's just easier you just have to go light enough towards not stressing out your knees so you've got about three weeks after this show into the next one two weeks two weeks okay what does the process look like for like a rebound going into because I mean you're going right into having to peek again right so we'll basically treat the next week like a normal cutting week where the oils go back in and then when it comes to seven days out we repeat the peak week again and then between the second show and third show it's only a week so there is no more oils going in it's just going to be a third peak week in a row and then my plan is after the 27th resume and HRT amount of test which might be an in a normal person that's 20 to 40 in me if I didn't see it 70 it would put me in like a 45 50 estrogen aisle but I wanted his experiment with meant but meant is a very astogenic so what I'll probably do is just do 20 test or 40 test a day which will probably put me in a much lower ester dial like 30 or something and then we're just going to escalate the mat started five milligrams a day because it's acetate not an anthane not that I like short esters but that allows us to get immediately to the results and then to pull it back down if it gets to the excessive well when you're in this short of a window of time between this and the surgery that we have exactly three weeks to experiment so it's like I can go five milligrams then go up to five milligrams twice a day then go up to 10 milligrams in the morning five milligrams in the evening and maybe as much as 20 milligrams a day because if it's all I'm running right if I'm using 20 or 30 or 40 tests and running five 10 15 maybe even 20 meant as long as the ester genes under control and we're not getting any nipple or I know like let's say we're at 20 or 30 let's see who do 40 test a day all right then that's almost pushing I will do 30 test a day and then five meant a day and then after three or four days if there's no nipple tenderness go up to 10 meant a day and then if there's your four days if there's no nipple tenderness go up to 15 meant a day and if there's no nipple tenderness after you know by the you know I wear the two week mark we're up to 20 meant a day now the nipples are starting to burn we go back to 30 with 15 meant a day we go back a step and then throw in 20 to max if I'm twice a day to knock out the nipple thing so we know exactly what the upper limit was at that test of that much meant now could we have mitigated this could we have introduced 15 EQ or lowered the test and benefited from the 20 meant probably so probably what we do is at the time is we be like mmm rather than pulling the to melt down from 20 to 15 again why don't we bring the test down from whatever it's at let's say 40 to 30 and stay at 20 meant and then run the tomoxophone and then run and then after three days to max if it'll take care of any mass that's developed and then we pull the tomoxophone and we're cruising we would have also another way as soon as the nipple tenderness happens I would immediately go in and get a normal estradiol and a ultrasound-sensitive estradiol and again a normal test DHT- estradiol and an ultrasound-sensitive test all at the same time and an IGF1 and you see like okay on 40 tests I'm at 1600 test I'm at 30 DHT and I'm at a 40 sensitive estrogen but I'm at a 100 non sensitive estrogen because it's picking up the methyl estrogen the seven-methanol estrogen from the mat it's like okay so the ments accounting for two thirds of the estrogen and the DHT is pretty good at 30 what we could do is cut down on the aromatization by adding in some EQ or we could just lower the test so if the DHT was 70 I would lower the test down from 40 to 30 if the DHT is like 30 I would like we're better off just lowering the aromatization because maybe the lowering the aromatization will neuter the ments anabolic effects we don't know so that's a good question is is my IGF1 a seven or eight hundred or is it only a 400 if it's only a 400 then the estrogen isn't really being that anabolic it's just being destructive because it's finding the estrogen alpha receptor more than the estrogen beta receptor if on the other hand we've got got dim and I am paying attention fucking bitch on the other hand the IGF1 is super high then we know that that estrogen is really working great we need to add in master on to compete with the estrogen alpha receptor so if the estrogen isn't helping at EQ if the estrogen is helping and turning add in master on it so it does methyl estradiol aid in the conversion of GHT I don't know the same way as we don't know we'll find out but what we do know is that it's a weak binder so the methyl seven alpha methyl isn't as bad as real estradiol for stimulating estrogen alpha but it lasts so long that it will still do the job so DIM or IP3 will help clear that estrogen and then equal would help stimulate the estrogen beta receptor but it would also decrease the DHT conversion so there's these different tools we could use but to me it's basically gonna be a point where all right we got a tenor nipples we can either lower the test lower the month or add any Q if the IGF1 isn't that much better or the IGF1 is a lot better add in master and then you know we can keep driving up the mat like how high can we drive that mat because that meant supposed to be so antibiotics so maybe 25 or 30 a day which is insane like the most of ever heard of someone ever using is 15 per day and not having huge problems so my estimation is 30 tests a day 15 meant a day will be the upper limit of safety and then to go higher with the men EQ would have to be introduced or master on a patch me to do but even if we were running 30 tests a day and 15 meant a day that's only 40 that's only gonna be a 315 a week so not two grams a week point three grams a week would be the upper limit on those drugs so to me the next logical step is add in 10 milligrams of trend and a f8 maybe that would be in the whole time to amplify the GH conversion IGF1 conversion from GH so maybe trend will be in there the whole time is and then maybe DHB would be a good antibiotic to use because it's an in between trend and master on an effect so maybe 20 or 30 DHB maybe 25 and a draw pre-training and then maybe anywhere from 20 to 100 master on a day so let's say you're running 30 tests a day 10 trying a day 15 meant today 20 DHB per day and a hundred mass trying a day so what does that come out to be? a 30 test 15 45 55 75 75 plus a hundred a hundred and 75 plus 25 anodrol 200 so now we're at 1.4 grams and we've got a very anabolic mixture and but that's way too many drugs for a normal person understand I'm nobody normal at a variable it's just way too complicated for most people like all use a thousand tests and 800 EQ and I thought a good amazing results and they're probably going to lose their hair or they're going to use a thousand tests and a thousand pre-mo and they'll get amazing results but they're probably going to lose their hair or they could use 300 tests and 1500 mass trying and they'll get amazing results and they'll keep their hair but this is a way more advanced thing because I'm leveraging all of the extra anabolic pathways from the meant and the trend and the anodrol which all works synergistically the DHB doesn't do anything special the master on would block the meant methyl estrogen from binding to the estrogen alpha receptor without decreasing total estrogen levels so it didn't get in the way for the adgeflon conversion and that of course the test is in there just as and we don't even need the test as an estrogen delivery mechanism we'd basically be using the test is just a DHT delivery mechanism which I really don't want there's like a test would almost have no place in the cycle you almost don't even need test meant would do everything the test you want the test to do I feel like it's actually a more interesting way to go about it if you plan on using meant as the substitute for the test base and time so in other words it's a stand out for the show don't even go back on test just start running mud I mean I think that that would legitimize the experiment more you're right there's due there's really no three weeks then I got to pull everything because I'm going to get blood work for the hair transplant and the docs cool about it because I'm a doctor so I was like do you really need me to have medical clearance because I can just write my own note he's like well that's kind of pointless just get a 12 lead at KG because we were talking about blood work and he realized like you know surgeon he doesn't understand what I'm talking about with blood work but he's not egotistical enough to where he's going to throw a stink about it and I guess the anesthesiologist works for him so they're not going to be bitching whereas normally the anesthesiologist said oh I'm not going to work on someone to visit this but in theory I can play the game this way I can just use the meant because it's acetate and pull it three four days before the surgery and I can honestly say I'm not on any steroids that's there's literally nothing in your system at that point and then it's not like they're testing from metabolites but it doesn't it doesn't even matter like nothing is active anymore I'm completely neutered and then I can go right back on the meant afterward you know like post surgery I probably wait two weeks because of there's a collagen situation but basically two weeks later BPC TB500 GH IGF1 I don't basically figure it out with Dom is to win those should go back in but it'd be BPC he didn't the doctor didn't know what BPC was he didn't ever hear of TB500 GH KCO he knew what GH was but he didn't know what had a healing application so all of nothing builds collagen better than GH and all of the studies that are talking about how steroids are bad for collagen or for tendons that's not true it makes count tenons stiffer so what it's doing is this increasing collagen type one but it's not increasing collagen type two so it's making them stronger but not elastic so they'll be stronger till they snap so as long as you don't lift too heavy so it'll make you stronger but it'll make you less tough you'll be stronger to a point and then you'll tear but if someone falls my advice then they never listen to Paul Carter and they use reps in the 10 or higher rep range or they're doing eight or six reps super slow not doing explosive reps or bouncing off their tendons as a recoil mechanism then you don't need the elastic and the tendons furthermore the GH does provide the elastic so if you're using GH and antibiotics you'll get more type one from the antibiotics and more type one and type two from the GH so this theory that tendons steroids make your 10 and stiffer and likely to rupture is irrelevant if you're using GH and this is a mechanism of GH independent and I've had you have one so all those people who are like two units is good enough and blah blah blah is like look the more you use the more fat liberation you got the more iGF one type three binding protein is probably going to get released the more iGF one you synthesize if you do it multiple times a day not just plastic before bad and you're going to get better collagen synthesis now people are concerned like well if you do it multiple times a day you're going to have insulin resistance it's like not exactly because the iGF one you're synthesizing increases in insulin synthesis they're looking at GH in a vacuum they're not looking at GH and the iGF one together and what's the cumulative net result so it's same thing with the iGF with the collagen type two if the even if the steroids decreased collagen type two synthesis it doesn't decrease as much as a GH increases so if you get plus one to type one from the steroids and minus one to type two from the steroids but you get plus two to type one from the GH and plus two to the collagen from the last in type two collagen from the GH then your net result is collagen type one plus three and collagen type two plus one so you're still getting more elastin and more stable you're getting stronger tendons and you're getting more resistant to tear tendons just at a three to one ratio not a one to one ratio and nobody looks at it that way nobody looks at it with intelligence at all and Nathan went through and Ella went through into the research for me and showed me the studies they never really tested the tendons they tested the skin in anovar so the skin in anovar showed the collagen increase they never tested the tendons to show trend decreased tendons strength that they retro-spective study looking at the tendons strength of steroid users who are on eight or nine different steroids not one person at eight or nine but they literally had a pool of people and they all list which steroids they were on and they wrote down all the steroids those people were on and the average person was had weaker tendons than they height the thedical normal person but it's not like they had an identical twin who never used steroids and did a tendon biopsy and compared it to the steroid identical twin who used random assortment of drugs no there is nothing smart about this at all so none of these even if their theories were right that a decreased elastin they have been proved it because they didn't do any fucking studies about it they're extrapolating data from rat and rabbit tendons and then comparing it to humans what this what rats and rabbits don't live fucking wait they're not on a high protein diet they're not doing any of the things we do so there's no reason to believe this another argument is going to be well people get pectares it's like they get pectares because they're lifting too strong they're lifting with too much weight so they get stronger and a faster right to make it tougher and even if that applies to the tendons as well that's not the point like the trend twins Mikey would not at tors peck if the guy wasn't doing one raps with 500 pounds bouncing it off his chest you keep circling back to geniki geniki's 280 pounds the angle in fucking 400 pound bench the angle in such a one he might be a very slow and controlled with the pause in the stretch position with maybe 300 pounds for eight if you were to extrapolate the weight but he'd be doing a more intelligent exercise anyway like he uses machines like most smart bodybuilders too that are that are engineered and specifically to grow the pucks not put pressure on the joints only fools would be using a barbell a flat barbell in 2025 or someone who's a eagle lifting which would be a fool and of course this power lifting is different because the sport is the actual lifts themselves so a power left or using a chest machine would be like a bodybuilder doing cardio when he should be doing posing like janji would just have an awesome fucking post the other day where you know in sports you want specificity so nothing is more specific to bodybuilding than posing and nothing gets your heart rate up as high as posing so posing should be the primary form of cardio because it works your heart better and you're training the skill you do when you compete whereas using a piece of cardio equipment for fat loss is neither optimal for your heart nor is it have anything to do with preparing you for posing on stage in fact it's the opposite result you want because it converts the two a fibers from something up more approximating a two x fiber to it's a one fiber so it makes your legs smaller so you're making your legs smaller and you're developing a skill that isn't a useful skill so posing would always be the better option than cardio certainly hit cardio not that there is in a place for a cardio but my heart rates way higher when I do posing than when it is when I do cardio my heart rates way higher when I do posing than it is when you're lifting and so it's funny that the scientists are now doing studies showing that posing is way harder on your heart than lifting or cardio equipment that where bodybuilders are seven their whole lives like posing is by far the hardest thing you could do and no one believes you until they start to impose you like this is brutal because people think it's like yoga and it's like maybe it would be like yoga but take a 200 pound muscular man and have him to yoga that shit's so much harder than a flexible woman who's got 10 or 20 pounds of muscle stretching 10 pounds of muscle is a lot easier than stretching a hundred pounds of muscle it's one tenth is much work which means your heart and lungs are doing one tenth is much work also and what's funny is in the comment section there's a lot of women coming on saying is this a plight of women and it's like in most people we're saying like no women's posing is nowhere near as hard as men's posing because one the poses are harder and then two you're flexing and stretching more muscle and women are also lighter so again every permutation it's less stressful so a lot of people like oh bikini posing super hard it's like that's nice but it's not the same thing as bodybuilding posing because you got to think like why would the worlds best bodybuilders be terrible at posing unless it's so hard they're not terrible it's just that it's just that much harder when you're that much bigger like posing a 220 pounds is way harder than posing a hundred me pounds I feel a lot better now that we got this shit knocked out that will make it to Atlanta and midnight kind of really nice place for us tonight so I'll plenty of room because we bring it up to unpack the whole fucking car to cook all my food for tomorrow and have all my sleep stuff and I gotta do an absinthe salt bath and posing and check in with the tripod so it's gonna be like two hours or more so maybe two o'clock in the morning will actually be getting to bed and then we can check out at 11 and then we only have eight hours to drive to get to the second place and I change the reservations so we can check into Maro Tuesday which means we have all day one's day to work out and relax and for prep rather than having this been three hours three days driving we just spend two days driving yeah the downside of that is it's gonna throw off my sleep cycle a little bit but the whole point of resetting my sleep cycle to go to about 11 and wake up at seven was so that on the peak week everything would be on schedule and head I plan this out a little better we wouldn't be checking in at midnight in Georgia we'd be checking in and Chad Nuga around 10 o'clock but I didn't do it right I was I wasn't thinking about how many hours is gonna take just to check in and then cook the food and then take the ups and salt bath so maybe two o'clock in the morning I'll be going to bed maybe I'll be able to sleep until nine it's not perfect but whatever I can't refine the price of the room and it took so long to set up is what it is we literally have to unpack everything yeah but having to move in to three hotels in three days is a lot worse than having to move into two hotels in three days yeah now this won't be bad at all how many hours have we logged so far driving it's eight and a half okay hasn't felt that bad we didn't drive it was you didn't know I still know it drives but why is it going so fucking slow why is this a to max 64 you turned on the you have a not by that much now I have to put my foot on the gas the whole time I wish I knew how to adjust the max speed I know that is an option so what tell me and try to wake up the day off the fucking final the most the most important thing is getting the most sleep possible because the more you sleep the better you look in the morning I'm not gonna set an alarm unless it's the last minute especially if we're doing self-taining like if we're not gonna even spray me that I don't have to worry about it because we have control of Thursday I'll get two coats and if it looks like shit when we wake up on Friday morning I'll jump in the shower rinse it off and we'll put the mahogany coat on and if it doesn't look good I'll rinse it off again and then we'll go in and have them spray me at the show for touch ups I mean as soon as I put food and water in me I think I look like shit but that will be the final arbiter and how we peek I mean in general I don't sleep the night before really but I've never had so many good sleeping pills so right now I'm able to cook knock my ass out and I'll stay out for four or five hours and then I'm up but so the last four days and I got four hours four hours five hours and seven hours and it was really catching up to me today so we get eight hours tomorrow like if we wake up at 10 a.m. fine yeah I'll have to check out said 11 and I'm like I don't give a fuck you might dick bitch I want to even do charge me another 200 bucks oh well I'd pay $200 to get two more hours asleep it means I'm gonna do that much better the next day welcome I still believe it 11 and we drive eight hours we get there seven p.m. you know I mean yeah on a Tuesday that's time enough for me to go to the gym and get an upper body and then in Wednesday I can do arms and then Thursday I don't live otherwise I have to do upper body and Wednesday Thursday is arms and check in and paint and athlete meeting and have Dom look at me I'd rather than get the gym out of the way on Tuesday and Wednesday and have Thursday just deal with show stuff but of course if the fitness center has cables I can just do the arms in the fitness center Thursday morning and then stop a problem how close to stepping on stage Tuesday usually like to hit your left I don't know it doesn't matter what I think everything is up to Dom because he's the coach I do not ever say anything yeah that's how coaching works I will when I've self-coached I look like shit that's why I hired a coach I can coach someone else but I can coach myself but in general in this situation if Dom was unavailable and I had to do this myself then I would say you would pump up lats out pump up arms because that's the weakest body part and it doesn't put any strain on your system it just allows your arms to get bigger and I would do it probably the morning of the show like unless I slept in my paint if we reinstoff the paint one downstairs got an arm pump then put the paint on about the oh shit now this is turned off now we turned that off the second time fuck because I want you to face me's got another warning thing yeah it's now for the next two hours I have to drive oh fuck all because of this construction and I had nothing to do with me so that's two of the five strikes and we end the first day and you said it's two weeks to get rid of one strike I don't know it's said you read it yeah did it say that I thought that's what we determined I know but I didn't see it flashing that time well I'm not going to go get another strike just to read it it's a week it's not a big deal because we're going to be not driving for almost a whole week but that'll be a nightmare if we have to action drive by the one the car driver itself okay so if you get five strike out events you'll get suspended for one week from any kind of auto steer when does one of they drop off three days a week two weeks doesn't say it just says you get banned for one week no if you get a dime there is a a cinema time before those are dropping I know I'm trying to find it but it's okay if you get the one week suspension your reset to zero strikes I don't that's weird I know but I've they have to just drop off without you getting all five of them yeah how fast can we check in so one thing we could do is I could walk in deal with the front desk while you load up the shit on a dolly once you get the card we take the card whatever we want to call it it's on a dolly take the card and we'll get into the room start unpacking it like you don't need a brand new camera shit in it's just my cooking and sleeping because you can use there bedding and stuff you don't have to remake the bed with black I don't have to make the brief back make the bed with black sheets the first day I don't even need that piece of luggage I just need the food the right the air fryer my sleep bag my CPAP and probably I guess I don't even need the tripod because you can take my check in pegs yeah I need my medicine and my supplements but I don't think I need box one of medicine I just need box two of medicine so that should be like yeah so we need the box two of medicine we need the air fryer the cooler on you is my one overnight bag and my CPAP all right cool and I may have CPAP so I only need my CPAP my red sidevation bag medicine box two supplement box a couture bonds box and cooler and my pillows and then once I get up to the room I can make let's see how do I do this while the chickens defrosting I'll do the absent salt bad then we do the check in picks get use the scale to get my weight then I will prep all the food for tomorrow and while and then eat while I'm prepping the food and eat my last meal after sticking my sleeping pills on an empty stomach so that I'm half asleep when I sit down to eat the last meal then I lay down and I'm out so we might be able to pull this off in minimal amount of time is ten minutes at the front desk ten minutes moving stuff into the room 20 minutes of absence all bath ten minutes checking in and then 30 minutes of well you don't have to make one meal for each of us I don't have to make all the meals for each of us and then the morning we wake up I make meal walk oh I got to check in again go down to the fitness center and get in 20 minutes of cardio then come back up do vacuums and prep food then last eat meal one while you're carrying stuff down and loading the car up because everything will be done except for that meal and then we can just go so in theory I guess it really doesn't matter we don't have to be efficient with a time to marvel just anything we can put out for tomorrow we should do that because I want to get in bed as fast as possible sleep is a priori so then I'm going I'm asleep by one or one thirty as opposed to two yeah I've been up since one thirty yesterday PM yeah you didn't sleep all night I had a pack oh there's so much shit I have like five cameras so they'll help I have every positive means for me I had the best I spent six months preparing for this week by sleeping I'm time and then last night I didn't get to bed until three because game ran over and then tonight and I I was up from I slept from I think three until seven so I took three until seven and then I was up and then yeah so when four hours four hours five hours four hours and then we might get eight hours but that means that we sleep until ten which I guess it's not the end of the world because Wednesday I'll probably be going to bed like ten a PM or eleven PM waking up at like seven Thursday waking up probably around seven and then ideally Friday waking up closer to eight nine but we'll probably wake up at seven so I'll have to spend my wheels for four hours or more and Donald have to struggle to keep the look all day as I keep eating and drinking and then so I guess going to bed late on Sunday and Monday won't really affect my circadian rhythm and I'm overacting but are we really I should not have pushed it to Atlanta I should have checked us into somewhere in China no good why do you think he felt so ambitious just want to see how far we came wasn't an option at the time it was saying it's either Cleveland or Atlanta so I was like well we'll get to Atlanta at eleven forty let's do that and then once I reset the tracking or whatever for the hotel in Atlanta then we're gonna recharge and Chad Nuga at nine forty and look that's a much better time and I can't refund the room and it wasn't that expensive it's 300 bucks but yeah I don't want to redo it again no just to spend 300 bucks to go to bed two hours earlier my plan is if I get back to the room after my fast and cardio in the morning tomorrow and you're still asleep even if it's like seven a.m. I'm I'm gonna wake up okay so that we can get on the road as fast as possible and get where we're going as fast as possible yeah because the scenery get there better the rest of everything on the because lately if I wake up I'm up like I mean not I can wake up and peeing it back to bed but if I can lay back down in 40 minutes and one fire I'm still awake I'm up there's no pulling so my eye mask is in my CPAP gag my reservation bag has chargers a power strip my speaker and my cell phone too so I've got sound so I've got sound the absence of light the CPAP that's and I can set up multiple chargers to charge my normal phone in my headphones I really should have prepared my final meal before we left but I figured I'd want to eat it fresh and hot what do I really need I need my mashed potato flakes one two of the avocado things that chicken so what's not in the cooler that I need I need the mashed potato flakes and the avocado I mean no potato flakes and the avocado so basically the air fryer box and the cooler and I just take two things out of that box and stick it in out of the food box and put it in the air fryer box that would suck if I forgot the salt and that would fucking blow well they'll have salt in the lobby would it be in that box yeah I remember packing a whole fresh salt grinder okay I didn't break down my kitchen I bought one of everything extra so like it's a new onion a new garlic a new parsley a new salt a fresh bottle of mac oil three fresh jars of almond butter rice cakes of caramel and non-caramel three bags of rice that are small and easily transportable the rice cooker 200 cups multiple bags of peasants carrots multiple packages of chicken tenderloin so like I really don't need that much stuff to cook for the food so I need the CPAP bag the red salvation bag everything I need to sleep the absence salt I need this one bag of absence salt I need my medication to box because the medication to box is different medication one box everything I need to go to bed on the first night is in the medication to box and what I would take in the morning who nope it's not worth risking it we'll bring both medication boxes because I don't think I put the back water in medication to box I think it's the medication one box oh and then the nope I was smart and I took one package of needles and put them in one of the other medication and one of the supplement boxes the other 19 packages of needles are in the gray case plus I have some of my club box and alcohol swaps right here I double packed things like that where in case I forgot something I hid everything I would need oh I need my trunks I don't know I think the trunks are in a random box no the trunks are put in with the tanning stuff but you know what I know this is stupid but it just makes more sense if I'm going to be the front desk to have you could just grab as many boxes as possible to take them up and that sucks it will just be moving twice as much should as we need to two times but then we don't have to waste time getting your fucking around and then I'm gonna come back out to the car for one thing and then going back up there we realized there's something else up there that we needed yeah get really annoying definitely don't need the rice box I guess I should basically help you unpack the car with everything we're gonna need and then go in and talk to the people while you load up the car I have absinced soft bath it's gonna be so much fucking time and then the check-in and then the people scale it's just anything up so much fucking fun because we're just listening to that podcast where Dom is talking about uh not podcast because he's a glass in plan we're Dom was talking about the purpose behind the absinced soft baths it's so funny I just checked he's like if you can't get any pics tomorrow fast that don't worry about it no we can get those tomorrow no problem yeah it's just the absence of bath is gonna be kill my time is absence of morning the only thing that's gonna be a pain in the butt is the absence of bath tonight but getting pics tonight and tomorrow will not be hard so it's up to you because I'm gonna be getting to Atlanta at 12 which means I'm not gonna be getting the bed tilt to if I do the absence of bath and the checking in and cooking the last meal and rather than just checking in, dropping one meal getting right to bed and not fucking with that absence of bath is that's six or thirty minutes plus he said I don't like care if I get pics tomorrow morning I say fuck that I'm morning pics are the most important pics it's the night pics that aren't that important well everything is important because it's data put no it's maybe I'll be wide the fucking like or maybe I could eat my meal like check in eat my meal then do the absence of baths don't fall in a sleep in the bathtub then I just have to get up towel off and then go right to bed so I'm like falling asleep in the top and using that 30 minutes wisely yeah if you time it right might actually make it sleep better well that's the point of it is it's supposed to add magnesium she's sleep okay it's supposed to be relaxing but if you're stressed out trying to find the time for the absence of like last night like mother fuck it was two in the morning and like now I go to this fucking absence of bath that took up like 40 minutes it's like I'd rather that 40 minutes of sleep than have this bath but I had to get the um spray paint off anyway so rather than taking a shower I might as well stick the bath who knows maybe this fucking hotel room won't have a bath all right talk to me about the five camera she brought five cameras okay so we have the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 we have the A7 S3 on the whole like shoulder rig set up with the follow-up focus system as that one's pretty fun we have the FX3 for handheld setup just kind of really lightweight when we're running around we have the A73 for photography and then I brought a Yoshika T4 35 millimeter film camera just for fun for when we're fucking around in New Orleans cool so yeah and then actually I also have a whole iPhone rig so I guess yeah that's another one I have like all the iPhone detachable lenses so the iPhone rig is for the actual competition because you're not allowed to have a real camera and the behind the scenes backstage right so you'll have like a skill of one two five with the iPhone being a one and the I and the Osmo being a one and the big Osholder rig thing that you've constructed is a five you have a camera that's like a two like my Sony AX7 oh no that one's also a five it's just a new size oh and size so the point is you have a small camera so you could walk around at the show with the small camera and mix them in me not say anything I could probably be really discreet with it but backstage no we want that stage no but just during your posing routine yes I was thinking I could probably just if I'm sitting slightly farther back but at a good level to get you I have a lens that isn't particularly big but I mean the focal length is huge so I bought you a VIP ticket but because you have a backstage path you also also have a generic ticket okay so you don't need but you're hearing as you don't even need the VIP ticket you could sit further back and then zoom in yeah what I need is really just clearance so it's really just about how many pieces right up from middle yeah so you'll have two seats you can either be in the VIP section or the normal section whatever's gonna work better for you okay you have two seats yeah so what a lot of people do I have these shows and this may not fly is when I'm on stage for the one minute someone will run up in the aisle kneel down and just shoot it with a real camera not an iPhone real camera in the aisle yes this is below the level of the people sitting no one catches them and then the worst thing that can happen is they're like hey you you can't use that camera and you try to ignore them for the other 20 seconds of my routine and then when someone walks up to you and puts your hand in your shoulder you're like it's okay he's done and then you just up on my camera right now and then if they throw you out we just come the next day without that camera yeah because at that point I'm done well that's not true so there's over 45 okay and they're gonna have pre-judging I think and finals for over 45 okay then I think it's pre-judging and then finals for over 40 then it's pre-judging then finals for over 35 all right so it pre-judging how far space are these then that space fell but that's you're missing my point okay finals is when I do my posing routine yeah that's the only thing that matters yeah is getting the photo of the posing machine I'm filling I can pose one time I have three attempts to get top five so let's say I get top five in the over 45 that is our one chance to get me posing so if we miss it even if I get top five in over 40 and over 35 we I don't get to pose on the other hand if I'm wrong and we do all the pre-judging's over 70 all the way to over 35 okay then we know if I'm top five in what specific division and we know that the first time I get to quote first division I'm top five is the only time I get to pose so let's say I get top five in over 45 do not get top five in over 40 and do not get top five in over 35 then you know exactly when I'm gonna be on stage and when you can fill me at the finals because I don't need to help back stage for finals the only thing that matters for finals is the posing routine and the awards are on yeah now if I don't get top five in over 45 and I get top five in over 40 then you know that too Saturday's a whole no deal but in the Saturday it's extremely unlikely I'm gonna get top five if Logan Franklin is doing the show that means you know he's like an Arnold classic winner right yeah I think I remember we saw him right so it's like we're going about the best in the world is gonna be competing and first so there's four more slots right and it's gonna be brutal we don't even know who the competitor list is now you could go on your phone right now and look at the Florida IFBB Pro Florida Pro website and it'll tell us exactly whether it's all pre-judging then all finals or if it's pre-judging final pre-judging final masters which is Friday I think it's Friday it a love then is when masters starts it says that the show schedule the actual like hour by hour schedule will be posted at check-ins and up if that's not what we need we need no no the order of things oh just the order okay I know I've seen I know it's there on the side all right so yeah after the tournament of champions whatever um men's bodybuilding there is no battle bodybuilding there's IFBB Florida Pro master's there is nobody building it's classic this is the IFBB league pro league for the pro right both there's nobody building anyway the whole that's certainly the bullshit and be safe order for masters and pros on their spectators classic physique men's physique figure bikini yes we're classic physique there's nobody building no it's just the way their website is laid out is I know it's terrible it's terrible upside okay but that's all it gives us doesn't tell us age groups or it does you might have to click on something you know what here we are we do not care about NPC event schedule men's bodybuilding event schedule classic physique IFBB pro for oh my god this is weird this was here before okay so you're not on the homepage you're on the event schedule page go to the homepage there's a lot you go to the homepage it did but hoping this will be more helpful no that was useless okay so masters pro pre judging in finals just nine five twenty five this is tickets why the fuck is this so convoluted yeah they do the terrible job this is the worst okay they put three different different competitions all on one website this is rather than having the NPC be a different website from the IFBB and the master should be a different website from the open okay yeah this is just general as fuck but this is what we have to go off of it's just pro masters prelimbs and finals 11 a.m. to five p.m. that's all it says Friday that's how can that be all the information they provide what is your competitor list published not on that you'd have to go to Google and type in IFBB pro for the pro competitors list because today the deadline was 3 p.m. for the contract signing so they have the competitor list they would have been published they'll never do a master's competitor list but they will do an open competitors list it's kind of cool to see my name on it next to real people poison oh hey there you are really yeah read can you read it to me all right so men's class because they we got angel bahana john Michael tell their country too USA USA Ross Caesar Barbados Tony coke Canada Everston coast amelo Brazil Peter Duper Italy Logan Franklin USA Logan Guthrie USA Benjamin Hodge USA Austin Jones USA Vadim Comar Nitsky Ukraine Todd Lee USA Charles Pearson USA David Prachaska USA Derek Simmons USA Lucas Ulbrick Germany Caleb Walker USA 17 people yeah so if I guess for the open oh wait they have the masters bro really yeah okay wait hold on but there's different divisions just over 45 yeah that's what I was about to go through all of them all right so 35 plus you got Tony coke Peter Duper Austin Jones Vadim Comar Nitsky Todd Lee Charles Pearson Karan stress the and then masters 40 plus that's only 7 people it's only 7 people it's only 7 people so 35 is only 7 people so my chances of getting first call out is 5 in so it's a 70% chance and 45 plus there is only 5 no way so means that I'm guaranteed to get to pose yeah I haven't gotten to pose in six years I haven't gotten top five in six years so I'm guaranteed to get to pose and then 40 plus there is 9 so there's more people and 40 plus and 35 plus yeah so there's a 55% chance that I'm gonna be in top five in over 40 and a 70% chance and it'll be top five and over 35 assuming we're all equal but there's 17 people in open which means that there's like a 90 and 85% chance I'm not gonna come in dead last it's gonna be good no because it's 16 this shows up as DNP did not play so if I can get fucking dude I would like to get top five of course but even if I got top 10 in an open show that would be fucking unreal it's too much and do it be awesome then I'd be like if I got 9 from the 9th best body builder in Sarasota Florida now 9th best classic physique I insert a son of Florida in 2025 all right so what time do we 10 30 okay so we love to 10 30 it is 10 PM we made it from Farmington Hills Michigan to Cleveland Tennessee so far yeah it'll be getting there at 11 51 we actually make good time because I was driving a son of pilot in the 1990 rather than 75 so actually I had a schedule I actually made up last time I missed an accident I'm not up pilot them want to tell them what you told me earlier and that one particular combat scenario where you were draining someone both through the trunk of their neck and direct. Okay so one of the consequences of doing too much damage to the head is you can decapitate someone which makes Diabler almost impossible you'd have to do it instantaneously so if you have focused mine forward duality you get to have an extra mental action around so I saved that for theft of Vita in the ant in the situation where I hit someone so hard in the head of a texture head off so that you can't you know you could use slurry action and bite them and then drink their blood but with theft of Vita you can keep drinking their blood from across the room while you continue to kill the other people in the room and as long as you're still drinking their blood you're probably going to get the Diab soon enough so if you hit them in the head for like 10 damage with a maze that does aggravated damage they're had might explode now they've going to have some blood left in their body unless they're almost out when you hit them so you have to theft them down to their heart's blood. If you know with 20 damage then you're pretty much going to blow them to pieces so you can just theft the heart directly so in one situation it hits them in the torso right after I decapped them so when I was theft of Vitaing from the stump I have to then grab them and then bite down in their heart with one of my slurry actions and drink from their heart with the slurry action while I'm drinking from their torso with their stump with the theft of Vitae so I'm deauthorizing two people at the same time one with theft of Vitae and one person with my things so day two we are traveling to Sarasota that we're going to get a Florida probe and we're in Atlanta Georgia right now at the 4th and hour yesterday spent the night in Atlanta only slept 4 1 a.m. hours which has been happening all week depleting and water depleting and salt depleting and carbs depleting and protein it's awful but I made weight this morning by this after I hold this weight and we are at 18% power and when we get to the supercharger we will be at 3% power so it's kind of a little close but what do you weigh in at 177.1 so again in case you missed last episode the goal of this season is not to win the goal is to get height at 64.1 inch and that will allow me to have a weight cap of 182 but in order to get a permanent height you have to do three shows so it makes sense if I'm going to suck all the way down to 177 in case I come into 64.0 to do all three shows back to back so that although I will look bad this season about may lose every show I will get a permanent height on the books of 64.1 so that when it matters at the Detroit Pro I can come into 182 because I look my best about 183, 184, 185 so it's kind of like we have to throw the whole season just to make this weight now could I come in at 182 and just try three times yeah but that's really disappointing to show up be 180 or 181 and then they height your 64.0 and then you don't get to compete so and then you have to wait two weeks to try again and also here's the thing if you don't make weight it doesn't count as one of the three so I have to make weight for the height to count and you have to get height at three times to get a permanent record I'm saying multiple times because you're not that you the individual are stupid but you would not believe how many times I have to over explain this to people in my personal life which is number one reason why I've eliminated all people for my personal life if they can't fall of the simple concept that I need to get height at 64.1 and I have to get height at three times in a row for it to be permanent at 64.1 then I don't ever want to talk to that person again they're too stupid to be in life and then after that if I now maybe I win maybe I don't don't really care what I care about is getting height at 64.1 because at determines my weight cap for the rest of my life goal number two is to get video of me doing my posing routine on stage in 17 years of competing it has never happened a single time and every single person I've trusted to do it fucked it up I even hired a videographer for $7,000 to come to the Detroit uh the Texas Pro and he didn't do it so and I paid the videographer there five hundred dollars and he didn't do it either they did it off center or they did it with a shit camera or they didn't record sound or there's um these the new way of doing the video footage is they shoot from the ground up and getting the lights in the background and make it dramatic and artistic mother fuckers we just want you shooting video over the head judges shoulder so that we can see exactly what the judges see when we did our posing routine that's it all I want now there's like a massive accident and everyone got over and I just didn't because I don't give a fuck I've got autopilot on and it's doing the driving so if grunk or whatever a is driving this car just and care about killing a cup then I guess I don't either now that's not true this is called humor you know it's a joke not a dick don't take it so hard but nobody gets my humor because they don't know Stephen Wright they don't know George Carlin and they don't know Tim Dillon or Normick Donald which are probably the fourish comedians that I fit right in the middle of that my delivery is like Stephen Wright my tone of voice is like no one McDonald my hyperbolic nonsense is like Tim Dillon and my cynicism is like George Carlin if you don't like it go fuck yourself so Kai what questions do you have maybe you could elaborate on your mindset of because a lot of people their idea of what it means to go into a competition is the only purpose for going there is to win but you do see this as an investment in your future in bodybuilding and I don't think people necessarily understand what that means because you know like okay Rob Stark and season two a game of thrones sent 10,000 men at Jamie Lannister from one direction because Jamie Lannister spy miscounted his army as 10,000 and so he let the spy go so that Jamie thought the whole army was coming meanwhile when Jamie retreated Rob's real army was there to capture Jamie so it's something called strategy and tactics so to set myself up for victory at the Detroit pro in February where I could come in with a one-y to wake up I had to sacrifice it this year coming in at 177 three times to get heighted in 64.1 and this is why I have conflict with people is I can't imagine somebody's intelligence being so low they don't get the concept after it's been explained to them three times and that's to me the idea that someone wouldn't understand tactics it's just it's hard to respect someone like that one of the biggest things that we get in comments is people saying oh look at this guy he looks so unhealthy I was just thinking advice from him like blah blah blah like he must be unhealthy use all these drugs how are you doing health wise what's here what's your status update how are you feeling I would have been perfect health but the nurse I was paying to give me I've even lit a thion was only given me 200 not 2000 so my GGT kept climbing up until I figured out what the problem was fired him and started doing that own ideas with the problematic lit of thion so I suspect my glutathione I mean my GGT is coming down but there's a two week half life so I wouldn't have seen the changes in any reasonable about a time I would have had a false positive on the blood test which would have just caused more stress but I'm 50% sure no I'm like 80% sure my GGT is improving other than that nothing's a problem less my APOB was fine my sister had in the sea was fine and nothing else matters nothing's more annoying so when tells me that each yellow is or the LBL they cannot wrap their brain around that I don't give a fuck I'll like care about his APOB that people just don't have a logical mind they can't understand the concept of eliminating nonsense and focusing on the things that matter boiling things down to the essential components how are you feeling mentally like how's your patience no no patience today my mood's terrible yesterday my mood was great it just comes and goes see like being carb depleted is bad being sleep deprived is bad having your electrolytes in balance is bad being water deprived is bad I'm carb deprived to calorie deprived sleep deprived water deprived and electrolyte deprived my brain chemistry is something nice most of my patients and clients are being sold kind right now that they're not calling me and asking me questions like how much water do I put in my GGT container you know which is 100% 100% can't divide 18 by 2 to get 9 everybody's staying the fuck away from me which is the best thing that ever happened to me except for one guy one guy had to make my whole life about him so yesterday you hit about two gallons of water you told me what's your plan for water today are you already pulling you down it's two thirty six ounces okay the past few days yesterday I had a little loss in that because he said you got to be we're gonna have to pull you really hard you might as well get comfortable with what you're at so I did I was I came in low on fat low on carbs low on protein low on water and low on salt yesterday rather than overdoing but I made way early so now pulling me harder isn't necessary so he won't because yesterday it went so well then I keep it up to day we probably don't have to pull harder once in Thursday we just have to maintain one seventy seven so if I lose more weight and wake up lighter than one seventy seven a mile and it looks worse the probably putting food back in it looks better we're gonna just bring me in at one seventy six or one seventy five it could be that my best look is in the low one seven is and then that's fine and I don't even need a one eighty two wake camp this year but it's body building that in that body stasis so the goal would be to always have a higher wake cap so you can keep pushing more muscle on the arms the lads and the quad sweet so obviously most people fly in for these cops we want to kind of talk about why we're driving like why it's all right so because I've got to show on the six the 20th and the 27th all within like a 12 hour drive of each other but it's 24 hours away from us it just made sense to drive down September 1st for a September 6th show then drive from Sarasota Florida to San Antonio Texas we got for two weeks in between so that allows us to stop in New Orleans do a day or two there stop in Houston see some people in Houston stop in Dallas see some people in Dallas and then go to San Antonio and that makes them more sense to me as we can get some good content I haven't reached out to people yet but I'm gonna reach out to Martin and Brett I'm gonna reach out to Keon Sean I'm gonna reach out to I already started up with Luke Miller and John Jewett and their respective cities will be seeing DJ so definitely Luke and DJ will see in Dallas definitely John are gonna see in San Antonio as far as I have reached out to the other guys yet plus I got a lot of clients in Dallas in Houston play a lot and they're all gonna want to see me so hopefully we'll have enough time to have everybody check it out and then whether what they needed me for a lift or whatever who knows maybe I'll get a sushi carb reload and I can invite as many people as possible and I'll just treat everyone to all you can meet sushi and have like pictures also that thing is you and I get to get some content so training with Brett and Martin we could get some content training with Keon content Sean content Luke content John Jewett content so again priority two was the priority one is getting height at 64.1 priority two is getting posing routine for the first one my life I'm filming and then priority three is getting great content priority four is having a great time and party five is maybe I'll do good it doesn't matter because if I lose I didn't come in at my best I sucked that way too hard after 24 weeks of dieting just to get them at one seven you know what do you think the biggest challenges are wall traveling like especially when traveling to a show and close proximity to a show some athletes like to get settled in for like a week or two that way they have time to acclimate like I don't know what do you thoughts I can travel a fixed competition I mean the reason why travel a fixed competition is because flying is so stressful and it changed your water levels I don't think driving is hard at all because the car is driving itself I'm just sitting in the car this is no different than sitting on a plane except for there's no two w a there's no security there's no possibility of law enforcement you're just driving and you don't have to pack the same I do like being in a home-based situation but you know the big shows in Detroit and the reason why is because there's no traveling that's the one way of home-court advantage plus the black backdrop so I think all the travel stress comes from flying nothing is stressful about driving but just waking up on my own bed making my food in my own kitchen and then getting in my car and driving 30 minutes to do a boring will be so much more relaxing than any other competition I've ever done in my life Dearborn so much closer to my house than anywhere I've ever competed in my life so my plan doing the Detroit Pro every year for the rest of my competitive career even if it's the only show I do every year although I would like to travel to Europe or Asia to do a fun show but the show that matters is always in me the Detroit Pro until I start winning and then once you win the Detroit Pro you go to the left in which case I would get a house or rent a house in Vegas and live there for two weeks to a month and take that serious you know to a camp oh yeah it is but these little master shows like the only point of doing them is if you win you get to the master's Olympia also the you actually know when I'm I'm miss-miss leading the third most important goal of this season is to practice peaking so that Dom can learn how to peake me properly so one of the biggest changes to this prep was the inclusion of Reddit Street time I was in the biggest change of the purpose inclusion of a coach okay and that a coach who would be willing to pose to peake me in person that he will actually you would not believe in terms of a higher to coach paid them for the whole year so they could show up to my show and peake me in person and they didn't show up so for a whole year I'm doing something I don't want to do falling directions I know are wrong because I need to be peaked because I can't peake myself and then they blow it it's no show up it's had to have been at least six to seven times with six or seven coaches so Dom's reliable has an awesome reputation is brilliant maybe I'm a smart as him but I may not be but he definitely has peaking down hold so John he's like a John Jewer but it's his not competing is not his famous I can learn a lot from him about my body and how to peake myself properly in the future but I plan to stay with I'm having such a good experience working with Dom this is one of the easiest prep ever whether it's from Dom or from Reddit TrueTide I don't know but the Reddit TrueTide took away all the food cravings yeah the reason I brought it up we've been getting a lot of DMs asking about like I guess the way that Reddit TrueTide will affect the future lands keep up the sport in terms of insulin use it's the biggest change or ever the biggest improvement to bodybuilding ever is Russia is completely different it takes dieting from one of the hardest part of your life to one of your easiest I normally don't go under 200 carbs from more than a week or two before the show I've been under 200 carbs for 16 weeks I've had no craving normally once you're lifting it's low enough your craling is high you start craving food you would never heat your food focus I'm not food focus I haven't chamodied at one time maybe I might it's been not being able to stop myself like I might have one extra rice cake or even instead of having two rice cakes with almond butter per meal on my high day I might have three on one meal or four or five at the last meal I could just can't stop eating them but that's not the same thing as a getting in your car driving to the store getting a pizza and eating in the parking lot crying for one year I went to my grocery shopping so hard when you're in prep I love Instagram that's a game-changer too because there's no temptations but I remember once I went my bot seven donuts and I would take one bite from a donut and then throw it out and then I would have another bite from a different donut and throw it out just so I got to experience the donuts and then of course like I'm crying about what a loser I am and sheave to myself for like six months after and those props where I do that stuff I look like shun on stage you know like I don't think my glue service condition as they should be but I haven't really had shredded glutes since I was 39 was it because I'm 46 like it's been seven years so it's harder now to get shredded glutes or is it because I ran I've been running test so this has been running test I've had estrogen so it stretched out my skin with fat in the off season so then now when it's time to prep there's not the same amount of fat there the same amount of muscle it's just there's loose skin from stretching it out so this last off season I went as high as 55 extra dial I mean I went up to 70 at one point I think this next off season the most we're going to do is probably 40 or 50 extra dial just so the glutes don't get stretched out any so the we're going to try out the maintenance the how it goes meant has a very strong estrogen and component to it so I'm probably going to run much lower test than I normally do and then rely on meant or you had the good idea of not even running test and just after the Daytona Pro just using meant before the second hair transplant like I've got four weeks between the Daytona Pro and the second hair transplant that gives me four weeks to run just meant and tie trade up on the dose and find it with my upper limit is and if we get to a point where it's too much roll it back throwing some to oxiphon and then a week out from and then like get blood work done when I'm blasting that see what it looks like if it looks hot because I still have to be clear for surgery pull out the men and put it maybe 20 milligrams of dead test and then go in and get the blood work done and be nice and cool for surgery go in there get the surgery it's a 10 day recovery time and then boom November early November I'm prepping for the Troy Pro. The second third week in that November my client and patient Luke is flying in from Virginia to train with me in Karina so he's going to I'm going to get like an extra bad for that studio and put him up for a week so it's going to have like a training camp where he basically cozy the gym with me every day we eat all the meals together and he just lived the life that's what he wants to do with his vacation is hang out with his coaches so like Karina we plan to run Karina schedule so Karina will come down or either will go up to flint and train at the gym or she'll meet his halfway at Umbra or she'll come all the way down to me and we'll train at like my favorite pee fit it's so weird that people are so upset why do you train a pee fit and like why don't you all I do is use machines and cables I don't give freeway to anymore maybe that's why you're not big it's like I mean I bigger than I was when I used power building it's like then it's like there's so stupid it's just like they think you fall out of the sky and what they think you do is what you've been doing for 30 years it's like no fuck face I've done everything and some things and nothing works see might as well do what is the least traumatic and you think what you enjoy if nothing's going to work then it's whatever's the least traumatic and what you enjoy it's like if you have to have pussy you just have to have it but you can only get ugly girls at least get an ugly girl that isn't stupid in annoying so if you're going to be lifting weights every day for two or three hours and you're never going to grow the most you can ever do is hang on to what you've got then you might as well do the shit that doesn't tear your tendons and hurts you and you're not always miserable with doing only what's funny is this off season I did the opposite of what Chase Irons would have if you do and I used last gear and last GH and I actually made more progress because I focused on training and a lot of people like well it's a good mother fuckers I used to do 1500 milligrams and 8 units of GH for almost a decade and I made slow study progress one year I listened to Chase and ran three and a half grams and ran 20 units of GH and it didn't I didn't grow any muscle it I just threw as much drugs as I could in myself didn't fuck on my organs really it just made no progress and then during prep I got basically got diabetes because after a prep I had like a 600 blood glucose and even shooting a human log intravenously I couldn't bring my glucose down just just yeah and then I had diabetes all off season until we instituted it right in the shoot-out at the rib again and probably and I still grew my arm is God maybe a quarter inch bigger my lats look a little bigger my legs might look smaller but that's because I switched from my training and I incorporated some of Paul Carter's advice and hurt myself like four times in a week and then I had to spend 12 weeks recovering from trying Paul Carter's low rep bullshit because there is something to be said like if you're doing too many reps and your lungs are the limiting factor not the muscle like when we trained with Junaki we were doing lightweight and it was my quad failing not my lungs so I think for me the perfect amount of reps is like 12 reps for presses and hamstring curls like extensions the perfect amount of times try close to 15 reps going more than that it's just too much willpower and the lung limitation but if you go as low as single digits you're pretty much gonna wreck your knees my life isn't applied to everybody but I'm particularly stronger now than I was before you know really excited about the quad training now that I figured out how to champion those CC hacks quads and then did a mechanical drop set we're instead of going posterior pelvic tilt going anterior pelvic tilt after you fail at posterior pelvic tilt and then you could recruit a different part of your lateral quad I went from 3 to 1 to 12 reps 12 reps plus 12 reps so I got like 24 reps and then went into a little bit of the pendulum to just try it out didn't hurt my knee at all I felt all lateral quad it was amazing so it's like now I know like okay that that my knees are recovering enough now that I can do the pendulum squat and if they're properly pre-exhausted it's all lateral quad even with no weight on the pendulum squat it was a great cessation now I know I feel like well you go to use weight to grow it's maybe maybe but you can always pyramid up I mean you can always escalate you can always progressively resistance it but just jump in in there like I'm going to do three plates because I want to do three plates and then you just feel in your knees and your hips and not feeling your quad it likes not going to grow when are you planning on pulling injectables are you those were pulled and I don't like doing that I've never done that but that's what Dom wanted to do so that's what I did the premise is that any hand regions are really going to bind to their the astronauts' sectors so they're only few leave in at the very end it's like limps straw I don't like the psychological aspect to wind straw I'm going to ask a little limps straw I can handle up to 50 N of r once I go to 75 N of r i'm a dick right now I'm on 50 wind straw in 25 N of r a day and I'm kind of impatient but I'm also calm I'm not like hyper anxious and if I wasn't having this bazooka friends yeah I'd probably be a lot more patient too but I'm getting such little sleep now what Dom does is he uses only long acting so even though you pull it a week out I mean all you're getting you're still a half of that new system there's no short acting but I was on 70 test 150 master on 40 EQ to crush the estrogen that was at the 6 40 trend and an athlete and then the orals and pull the all the injectables seven days out except master on was increased and then master on was just dropped like yesterday so of all the injectables master on the best one but he's so pulled it and you're still using clunt nope did you end up using dmp this prop no dmp is like a winter thing I might use it in the winter when I'm prepping for the Detroit pro and disumber January February in Michigan and last we moved down to like Texas to do the first two months of prep and we moved down to Texas for the first two months of prep then that would be a lot easier then I just then moved back to Detroit the last two weeks in February to get ready for the Detroit pro or the last week but I have a feeling doing a temperature change like that you can get sick that's the only just downside of Detroit pro is way too early why would you want to prep in the winter in February it's fucking crazy but I will say it sets you up so that you could do the Arnold it's one week before the Arnold so I'm gonna apply for the Arnold even though I probably won't knock it in I can solve fly how did it determine if someone's application gets accepted for the Arnold social media following probably and if you've won it open to show before it'd be just there's some other shows obviously Tokyo November 25th would be fun to do but if I'm this is a game that hair transplanted I can do that not this year then there's the Japan pro which is in July or August then there's the Dubai which would be a lot of fun it goes like Japan India China right in the world but now they've got shows in China two or three times a year they've got Korean shows two or three times a year Japan shows two or three times a year when you're doing classic there's so many more opportunities than two to twelve China would be cool you've brought up Dubai a few times recently that's the same sold me on it like rather than moving to Texas moving to Dubai my people under choice there's no taxes that's for a westerners they want you to bring your items and the gym is they have a doctor's office in the gym where they just prescribe you whatever trucks you want they deliver to your apartment you can have an apartment in the gym if they're a hotel on top of the gym and then there's a supplement store a clothing store three restaurants that have just like plain chicken plain rice plain yellow rice rice with raisins it's like made for bodybuilding then they have massage therapy IV therapy red light therapy and it's got hundreds hundreds of equipment they have the complete new tech line the complete not a line two that sounds like your dream it says you never have to leave the gym you just have all we would do is shoot content and that's it this setup of studio in the apartment shoot camp like exactly what I have now it's just instead of having to drive to a gym I just go downstairs how strong is the US dollar in Dubai I don't know why I'm she look I mean I've never heard anyone complain that it's expensive to live there okay do you average monthly cost of living in Dubai for one person is twenty three hundred dollars a month there's nothing fucking Detroit it's like four thousand it's cheaper than Detroit and Detroit it's like a third of countries not even rent it's me my my rank is more than that yeah it's considered I guess it still ranks is the top thirteen percent most expensive cities in the world but I don't know that sounds very reasonable to me dude it's like felt asious people live this is the perfect I don't even have to park the fucking thing apart from themselves how are we got it's 20 minutes yeah so getting on a stage it's like everything comes to life it's like you can see in color it's like the best part of your life and then you wait all year to do it again so I get to do it seven times in these three shows and it might be hard but it's gonna get less there's less pressure each time every time you go through the round of posing you're just that much more locked in you're that much more fluid whenever I'm on stage my posing is so much better because I'm all warmed up from posing backstage and I just can't wait so I don't understand how anyone could be nervous because the worst thing you can do is lose but you don't win anything so it doesn't matter it's the competing itself is the reward that everyone else's worst nightmare is your greatest dream that the number one dream nightmare people have is being on stage naked the only time it sucks is if you really don't like how you look then you're embarrassed to show your shit physique but I usually just have to look around that the people in line with me and I'm like oh I may think I'm soft but half these guys are softer than me so I think like setting the bar is higher than last time so in 2012 I never really placed well so even in classic I've never done it before so unless I come in dead last there's no shame in it so I've been visualizing winning the over 45 I didn't visualize winning anything else but even if I got top 10 in classic and I'm open then that's still pretty good especially since there's 17 people so if I get like top 8 I'm more than 50 percent now if I had a history of getting second place then I would be disappointed with third place there's a big difference from being an amateur and being a pro like as an amateur I never would be taller in of anything other than first place I should always win because I almost always did win but once I turned pro and being the Texas pro and got 11 in in a 212 I didn't visualize posing I didn't visualize doing my routine so the fact that I almost set myself up to fail and not be top 10 this time I had no doubt in my mind I would get through my routine and fate would have it that there's only five people in over 45 so I'm definitely getting into my routine at least on Friday so this might be it you know this Friday might be the only time I get to my routine out of the next three shows it's a lot of pressure on you to get an unfil me but if I manage to get top 10 in every one of those shows then at least you get three chances to get through a team but I'd like to get make sure we get it every time because then we can compare you know like how much better did I execute it and San Antonio then I did at Florida how much better did I look like I think almost every day my posing is getting better like my real-life spreadsheet improved my front-line spreadsheet improved my side chest is almost perfect my side try steps being improved my red double-byze prime my best pose my front double-byze better my front-an-thighs better my classic every single pose better than it was to be three weeks ago so like all the professional pictures you took for the website I smoke all of those already what do you think your hardest ever prep was either 2019 or 2019 it was brutal last two weeks but I was the when you got your card right no no is that 2020 2020 is when I got like okay the 2019 is when I have my best look last year was one of the most brutal prep's ever and I had the worst look of all time probably one of the easiest prep's 2020 and I had pride in my second best look. Korean is as 2020 was my overall best look. The problem was my coach bailed on me the day of the show and then the next year for the 2021 Texas bro he goes to me to weeks out by switch to Cuba and he did the best he could I'm going to look better not I think I look better without his help that I was running a hundred trend and fifty wind straw and I look great and I went up to a hundred and ten trend and 75 wind straw and I just started falling apart so I rolled back to a hundred trend and fifty wind straw and I should just stay there and then he pulled me down to three fifty trend and why me putting in three fifty master on but I didn't want to use my master on because I thought it would cause hair loss and then I looked better for about a week or two and then right around the final week I started falling apart so had I just listened to the put in the master on it would have went perfect so I at what point in time did you determine that master on didn't cause hair loss in 2023 that I had been running pre-mo and it was very effective at lowering oxygen and then I switched the master on in a prep with Luke thinking that it was going to be even drier and then we got the blood work back after a few months of nitrogen blood work and it was a 200 oxygen like wow it looks like master on business press session and all and I took out 20 tests a day and put in pre-mo a day left the master on alone and my estrogen dropped from 200 to 100 it was like wow pre-mo's way stronger and that's how I figured out that pre-mo was in the eye and master on was not no one ever figured that out yet and let the two aren't interchangeable which is right and so I told the world about it and that's when people like Kurt and Steve and Chase started laughing at me as no one in ever ran blood work again before they had no idea so I started doing these videos explaining that pre-mo's in the eye and master on isn and that if your coach has heard you by crushing your estrogen, I'll fix it so I had so many people leave those coaches that use pre-mo and started hiring me and I went from having like two clients sign up a month to like ten clients sign up a month but I pretty much blew the lid off on the whole mass-trun versus pre-mo was an exchangeable shit so I think that's my big impact to the industry is educating people about mass-trun not being an eye before me everyone thought of mass-trun was an eye now maybe this isn't true but my circles and all over anything I ever so I've never heard that mass-trun was an eye until I found it out myself and I've never seen mass-trun be an eye I am like a worker ever in other school time where does the myth come from then? Just thinking of people probably with your black I used to feel like if I died it'd be okay because I made the world a better place by creating Thor's hammer and then if people want to get someone pregnant they could get your Thor's hammer because no one knew about ffsation the time but now I think the biggest contributing thing I did in mankind was educate the world of mass-trun was better than pre-mo because it's not an eye and it inhibits the estrogen alpha receptor in some way some alicderic not competitive way so you stop the feminization of the estrogen without stopping the antipolychofoxidation I just didn't expect it to go so well that no one can get mass-trun now I drastically improved the demand what I did not have any way of improving the supply I feel sorry for people who aren't smart enough to buy their drugs and here's some events some most people yeah yeah as soon as the terror started dropping and as soon as they move warships around Taiwan I was like well if they seized Taiwan then Nvidia is gonna plummet so I sold all my Nvidia and I basically just stocked up on mass-trun and I'll never sell it because next year the world will have been without mass-trun for a whole year so I'm gonna be that much have not much of a magic mixture and then at the year after that the same thing so when you talked about tactics like well you know like people don't understand the I could never explain to anyone and have them understand how much I actually have planned and how multifaceted my schemes are so that there's more like why would you throw this season and to focus on nex season it's because nex season I'll still have all the best drugs in the world and no one else well so that's why nex season matters more than this season I may not have genes for growing muscle but I have other genes the genes that allow me to plan one of the like top vendor sites that I've used in the past obviously not gonna say which one I'd never really seen it featured prominently before but now if you go to their inventory page at the very top it's DHB. It's the first one on page yep. Are you implying that you haven't happened like within a month if you're putting out DHB video. Interesting so it's hard to say what influence tip but nobody really talked about DHB it seems like. With the absence of master and I had to find a neutral agent that did not negatively or positively affect estrogen. I had to find a master on replacement and DHB this completely neutral in regards to Estudado. It neither rises it nor lowers it and I don't think it's gonna be bad if it's inhibitor so really DHB is even more neutral than master on. This is not an ERL for antagonist making DHB the perfect antibiotic. That in the antivar it's just an antivar is hard on cholesterol and DHB may be hard on the liver in some people. Now that I know it was because the nurse was lying about how much you'd have found he was giving me. I don't think the DHB was nearly as harmful my liver because when I stopped using the DHB might liver my GGC kept doubling every month and after I stopped using. Now I'm almost completely convinced that DHB or mag would be the absolute best off-season grow agents with master on and trying being the best contest prep agents and tests being an acceptable pro hormone to DHB to DHT and to Estudado but if you're using an evar and met off-season or master on and met off-season then you may not even need the test because the met provides the estrogen and the master on although it isn't DHT if you're using all the know of it it'll protect you from the estrogen from the met doing feminizing things. The master on would eventually give you the same antigenic effects because it's not like a zero antigen value. I just think that master on a met might be a phenomenal combination. DHB is just more in a ball. But for people who can't get the master on in that case it's so it'll be interesting. So the experimental start using just met and if and when we hit an upper limit on how much met we can handle before getting in Gino roll it back into to max of it and then start throwing in a lot of master on and then after about three or four weeks start escalating the mental again and see if the master on who raises the threshold of tolerance for the estrogen so that more met can be used and never touching testosterone the whole time or using like an HRT test testosterone. We're literally on the last this home stretch we've got two hours of drive to do and then we'll be at the final hotel and we'll be in Sarasota for five days I think it's a two-day through Sunday so the Kishoa is Friday and Saturday so after the show Saturday we can go back to our room go to sleep wake up Sunday then drive to New Orleans I just talked to Martin sounds like we'll be going for New Orleans to Houston and getting a lift in with Martin while we're in Houston I'll try to reach out to Terrence and Hunter and other people while we're in Houston then we'll look to Dallas try to get some something done with DJ and Luke maybe he on Sean then had down the same Antonio John Stuart compete and then drive back and that's I sound tired because I am that we've been driving for almost eight hours today so between the yesterday it's already 22 hours now I'm not really driving the car is driving but this is a longest trip I've ever done that I can remember. What are your like last minute preparations what are you prioritizing going into your next basically everything that leading up to the second new step on stage no fuck maybe no fucking idea all right but the date that we with the Dutch tells me to talk to them yeah it's a the coaching thing is a looting people but they don't get what a coach does the coach tells you what to do and your job is to do it you know agency yeah there's no agency no autonomy no autonomy no autonomy no not a single thought like a dog you do what you're fucking told they say sit you sit it's so simple it's not my job is to tell people what to do and they fucking are expected to do it and the same thing with I hire a coach I will do what the coach tells me to do it's like oh would dog shit would you want it to be running or do you want it to be solid I will eat what you tell me to eat I will go to bed when he tells me to go to bed I will do what the fuck I'm supposed to do this is peak week it is the only thing that matters is following orders because if it's wrong then we know it's wrong and we change it for the next time but if I don't do what I'm supposed to do then we don't know that the data was wrong so we wasted the collection this is what I never have girls on podcasts because like okay tell me about your training well I do with my coach tells me to it's like okay so tell me about your diet well I eat my coach tells me to eat and it's like all right so this is a useless test now if you were to ask me what did I do up into this point then I can tell you because at least remember what he told me to do but I don't know what he's going to tell me to do in the future I mean I even paid a thousand dollars to take the blueprint so I get to see what his plan is for a generic prep but nothing we've done has been a generic prep so far so I have to do so that if we have been falling the playbook up until this point then the playbook for the end will also be different now if I was to anticipate what's going to happen since I was 177.1 this morning I would expect that as we continue to pull water out we'll be putting carbs in so that my weight stays 177 but my glycogen supplies will fill up and I will get fuller and harder tonight tomorrow Thursday Friday and even Saturday that is what I suspect will happen that the goal would be to keep me at 177 not let me get lower but not let me go higher let's say now tomorrow I wake up at 176. I'll probably give me more food probably don't have to pull more water out but I will just be shedding more water in general because so many things that work on the Reno and geotense system and out the off-shrown system have been removed. I'll probably want to experiment with diaside to see if I look better or worse with it tomorrow and if I look better with it we would just keep it in and increase the water so that I don't get flatter so that come the day of the show just pull out a little bit of water and then I look harder. You have to leave some water in order for glycogen to be synthesized but if you're holding water you don't need to worry about it like I think I have pretty full veins compared to this morning and I've had very little water today. I've only had like a gallon today and I've only had two meals. I'll probably hit up her body tomorrow after two days rust but if I feel as bad as I do right now geotide rated with low electrolytes there'd be very little reuse into doing anything because as as soon as I start trying to get a pump I'll start hyperventilating and giving overgated like I can't even really pull this right now. I'm too miserable. And even cold like all day. Yeah I feel like I'm gonna have to be mine a water of fractionally when I'm the salt. Way less protein carbs and fat. He was impressed though that I managed to get better even though I drove 14 hours. That last night we didn't take pictures with this morning and then I'm only sleeping five hours and I'm giving better every day. I mean even in the at the gas station earlier you looked better than you did this morning. Oh yeah way better way better. I had to fall striated just fucking my rectus abdominis was popping. I had striated obliques. That was where I looked really good in the bucket and then my vacuum looked great and I was after two meals. Yep. Two meals and almost a gallon and I've been up for almost 12 hours. So we know how to hold a look right now. I know he's exactly what to do to get to be fuller and drier than I woke up. This is to have those meals and that much water and that much potassium and that much sodium. So even if that's not around I can hold this look for days because I know exactly what to do to improve it. That is me and I don't want to be around my mind. His health is like a pride getting better but I could I would have been very comfortable stepping on stage an hour ago. An hour ago was the best I've looked in maybe six years. All right so some of you know a lot of you think that my life revolves around antibiotics derives. I honestly don't give a flying fuck about steroids or a tool that I use for bodybuilding. Bodybuilding is the third most important part of my life. The second most important part of my life is metal but the first part most important part of my life. The thing that matters more to me than anything is an empire of the masquerade. So I can't go anywhere without my vampire books. So since we're still going to be playing me in my group when I'm on the road I still have to have some resources to prepare for. So what I brought with me is I got a fourth edition rule book set. I think the fifth edition sucks because it's super woke the fourth edition is much better and this book like that's the first the first city of Enak. This is just you know the different clans of vampires. Giovanni's one of my favorite clans. Tramirs one of my favorite clans and the shemisi are my absolute favorite clan. So Brad, who's my storyteller and I run for I also love those silver two. He plays a tramir and has been playing at St. Tramir since 1999. I've been playing the same shemisi since 1996 and I'm getting chi into it and he might end up being a Giovanni. So shemisi is my favorite clan. They're flesh crafters and wizards. Tramir are wizards too and the Giovanni. I'm not going to say what they are because Kai doesn't know yet. The Kai is a complete virgin. There's no idea what he's giving himself into. So this is the core book because it's fourth edition. They put everything in here so you could theoretically buy this book and then you have everything you need to know to play. The problem is this book is about $200 and it has to be made because nobody can afford books anymore. Then I also brought the Dark Ages book which is okay. So since vampires are old, it's silly just to have a modern book. When half of the vampires, the elders at least are going to be hundreds of years old. So they have different versions of the vampire religions in here and some of the vampires that it could be modern day have existed before the two sucks, the Camaria and this about obviously I love this about. Since my favorite clan is a chimese and was sombra and Tramir technically a bloodline of chimese and I do love me some Giovanni. So I brought the chimere book because I'm running for a chimere. I want to make sure that I'm 100% versed on a lot of the politics of the clan premiere and it's extremely organized clan. Some plans like the bruha which I hate have no organization, the Torridor which I don't like either they have no organization, the gangrel have no organization, the Malcavians have no organization, the Giovanni are another extremely organized clan. Yeah they're one of my absolute favorite clans also their parent clan which I'm not gonna say in front of Kai. So one of my all-time favorite clans and all the separate bloodlines associated them are fucking amazing. I just absolutely love them and the clan that they came from in modern day. Now I also brought with me the chimese second edition third edition clan book and the chimere second edition clan book. Now in our game the chimese were wiped out completely except for my character's alive, your ex still alive, Drake owns the live and the Indian branch is so live but we got four fourth gen's left and they have to repopulate the earth with the clan in their image. So the Raven and families are so alive so I'm gonna start interviewing Raven and it's to embrace them so I can repopulate the clan. This is the religion book about it's kind of like the vampire's version of Genesis and it also talks about the original 13 vampires and it mentions a few other ones like Lushe and Mecket which didn't make an appearance since it began up and Lushe and Mecket actually have been serving with Lith and this is the Relief Bible which is kind of funny because my character Jack is pretty much the leader of the Bahari which is a female religion of the Lith worshippers so it's weird that a man's actually running the feminist branch of vampiric politics. In fact we had a civil war between the black hand and Jack because he wanted to make the Lith an alternative to cane as the origin of vampires so that people had a religious freedom. The black hand didn't like that and tried to assassinate him. It resulted in me raiding element. Now this is a book it's a werewolf book but it covers van Cover where Brad's character is gonna be going to van Cover and trying to do some politics in there so I have to read this while I'm on the road so I'm prepared before when I get back for van Cover van Cover's a weird city and this most important of all is Becket's G-Hideiri so Ganna happened around 2003 and during 2003 and 2018 they advanced the Metaplat a ton and it's all covered in this book and so Beck is this is an in-game prop that characters can get their hands on and it's got an incredible artwork in here. This smiling Jack, the artworks incredible and it's all Becket's hand written out. Becket was the one who created the book and noded from the Earth's fragments. He also made the Encyclopedia of Enpiraco and so I've never read this book. I've never seen anything in it. I've been saving it for a special occasion and it's because our characters are still in 2004 so it doesn't really matter but I'm going to need to know stuff like this so as we play through I can do some of these events. There's some things I think that are silly like the MSA and blowing up for Shred. I think I've looked into the math of it and it's not it wouldn't really work. I think it's just though the woke people came along and tried to rewrite the game in 2018 with 5th edition. They didn't really understand the game that they've been alive longer. They haven't been alive as long as I've been playing this game so I don't respect their decisions and I don't give a fuck what they think. In our I know what I'm doing better than they do because I've been playing this game since before they're born. So that's pretty much it and when I make enough money I'm going to buy the IP for the game so that I don't have to have to deal with anyone woke ever again. So that's that they for instance they cut down Raytheo oblivion in like 98. Demon the fallen was taken out in 2003. They kept the IP going for vampire the masquerade where both the apocalypse made the ascension but the two other sweet games Raytheo oblivion and demon the fallen. They let that IP pretty much go so I could probably buy up those and start producing new versions. So right now I'm recreating all the rules sets and making streamlines was kind of like man-partheor wrecking them and hybridization of fifth editions, rules and wrecking them's rules but with the fourth edition plot points and so we'll have a new gaming group of people who've never played before have no idea what's going on. Nothing about the game and nothing about the rules to play test through mine and bread is six edition and then from there I'll just we'll probably do a YouTube channel where we actually show the game and have a high production kind of like critical role but with animation and stuff so after the fight scene they'll be actual AI animation of what happened in that fight so it might be a really cool production and might take a couple years to get it going but I've got a lot planned for this because this the most important thing in my life number two would be metal and number three would be body building steroids isn't even on the list so let's pretty much it. What you got me talking to myself about vampire well I think what it'll happen is people who will start to really want to play the game like and Ganzo would probably love to do a Skype game like have it where like we're not in person but a Skype game with this favorite claim is Torrid or which is an extremely boring clan but we're in some for the premiere the premiere of the only interesting camera clan they're just so generic those plans now fifth edition they kind of gave Gangrel and Gangrel in the ventrrew and overhaul and made them better but they also in fifth edition fucking fortitude as broke is shit the barhara only liberal like kind of class and I deal with and then they took the ventrrew and they went back to the original concept that the mafia was part of plan venture and so the venture are probably one of the best plans and they even came up with a concept of like the Gangrel corporate rator so like in fifth edition in the can the Gangrel and the ventrrew are fucking awesome and they nerfed the fuck out of the premiere in fifth edition but and then the barhara still suck as fucking hate the barhara the milk caveans they they switched them from being the fuzzy bunny slipper bullshit to the more like the serial killer crazy people or people who are profits and had their mind so they made the milk caveans a little bit more interesting no strats are still fucking boring and torridor torridor still boring is shit they're torridor like anris vampires they're just the foppy sheen affected like let's stop and Louis and she's and then the la sombre fucking awesome they even made the la sombre sweeter in fifth edition then she means they put him into a row out of the game at first and then when they put him back in they were got a huge upgrade and were sweeter in concept and they changed the followers to set made them less culturally specific they changed the rev no sombre them less culturally specific they completely changed name of the estimates to bano Hakim to represent the schism that took place when Usugli rose the Giovanni they did some major with the Giovanni and the sub clans in fifth edition that made them amazing again none of like the Giovanni did not even know their so fucking sweet the schoenese were a little bit campy in third edition and they made them sweet as fucking fifth edition by just focusing more on the Dracula concept because Dracula is schemese and they went away from just the gross monstrous schemese the central premise is like if you're so monstrous you can't even remotely pass for human then hunters find you more easily that because of technology advanced so much between 2003 and 2020 that the government to the world had much easier time hunting vampires so anything that stood out got wiped out so clans that were boring is fuck like toward or bruhah melcavians ventrue they actually survived the second in acquisition a lot better than the really weird as clans like the schemese pretty much got almost completely decimated which is fine I mean but that's as of 2018 through 2020 and we're still trapped in 2024 so not a lot of that shit hasn't happened yet so be interesting how it works and I will say the second edition second in acquisition books amazing because they go country by country and explain how the NSA or the church works with these different groups like Argentina Brazil like every country in the world has special forces units that are combination of like navy seals with priests that are just super focused on vampire hunting so a lot of the theme of the fifth edition is you have to hide from the humans the second in positions one of the major themes so like the second edition
