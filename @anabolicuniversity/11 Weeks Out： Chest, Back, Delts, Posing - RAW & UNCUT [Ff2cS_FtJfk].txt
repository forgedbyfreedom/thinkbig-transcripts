Worry! You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. Hello and welcome to Umbra in Shelby Township, Michigan, where we can use tri-pods and we can train with our shirts off and everyone is at least average if not above average attracted to us, especially the women. And all the equipment is fantastic and the lighting is phenomenal and there's a digital clock on the wall so we can tie my recipe here. This place was made for people who want to build muscle but it accommodates people who do crossfit powerlifting even the chaps who do strong med and it has some of the best stretching equipment I've ever seen. So if you're in Michigan this is one of the two coolest gyms either RTB down river or Umbra in Shelby Township. We're going to do back chest which is really tri-pods for me and delts then we're going to pose if you're just tuning in. Shame on you! Watch the videos in fucking order. They're enumerated in reverse order because it's a countdown towards victory. All right now off with you. You I'm gonna get you out of the bad. Straighten your head. Pull the ball and just slide away from us. Straighten your head. Straighten your head. Straighten your head. Straighten your head. Don't hit 17 on both sides. I still have more in me too. Me as I'm adapting really fast. I have to put more weight on. That's weird. That's weird. See how much progress that is? That's crazy. It's way too much progress. It makes me feel like I'm sandbagging it. But my backs have been sore all week. I went up from eight sets to nine sets. I'm back. Went up from four sets to five sets on quads. Remember this is three times a week. So I went from 24 sets of back to 27 sets of back. I went from 12 sets of quads to 15 sets of quads. And all my loads are progressing. So I'm gonna have to... We're gonna see either feeling an LA. We're gonna be training less. So I'm probably gonna get... It's probably gonna be a D-load week. Because I'm doing things differently with other people. So I'll get novel stimulus. So I might get acute soreness in the lads or the quads. But my systemic volume is probably gonna be lower. Because I plan on training with each of them once. Maybe genetic twice. And then in theory that's all we're gonna be doing. Which will be four days instead of six that week. So it'll be kind of like a D-load week. And then when I come back to this, I won't have the rest-bosses in place. Oh fuck, I didn't put the 10 on this. That's why I felt so late. Can I feel it, can you be here? Stupid asshole. Alright, at least put the wood on this. Yeah, put the wood on that side. Just down on this side. Huh. Well... Oh fuck. What's this? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's nothing. It's nothing. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. ... More mean. That's not awesome. But I've had all this ore. What you did to I was just alive.. ... ... This one's just a novelty. I can't eat a meal or two then yeah. Damn, it's spare twice. Ahh. .... ... And, I've got... ... Fuck you. .... Hm. So that was 17 on the right, 19 on the left, it's too fucking light. But when I did two plates last time I tried on the right, I felt nothing in my lap. It was all re-doubt. It's frustrating. It's all I kind of liked when Walter H. Raps. It allowed you so hard to hit. It may as to do something. Starting after you. Do you find this as heavier than free weights, even though it's at an angle? Not really. It's just these drummers. My lower back. Right, right. Right. Right. Right. I thought it was super heavy, but I haven't done free weights in years with that exercise. So I was like, a plate in a half, I was like, wow, I had no control. This one, the arsenal one, yeah. It's too heavy. Thanks, buddy. I got 17 on set too, I mean, I can't possibly get less than 12 times. 12 reps. You know you're hungry when you're a burps, so I'll say, I've, you feel in the wrist after inhaling them. Good, so excited. And I this is not happening it's Yeah. Oh. Oh. It's all over back. You got her back doesn't feel it. Fuck this. If you watch how that guy was doing earlier, you see how he was his whole body was doing. He was like a deadlift and he was finishing a deadlift with a little upright row. Oh. Oh. That's the trick. Get your forward more. Still, it's still all over back. Anyway, I was going to take it easy on upper back today because it's been sore. Oh. Yeah. Twenty. Two light. You always got to put down what your settings are because I didn't remember what my settings were last time. It's now I'm going to know for next time because 22 reps with one 50. That's some bullshit. What a waste of the set. I do have a pump though after one set though. So the reason why I think it's bullshit is I don't need to do 20 reps to feel my packs. I might need to do 16, 15, 17 reps to feel my lads. But if I can feel my packs from 5, 6 reps, that's still too dangerous to have you for someone my age. I should go as heavy as I can without getting joined pain, which would be 12 reps is easily a safe rap range for me. It's ironic that planet fitness is the only gym that considers what someone who's lifting weight actually needs. The machines counter reps. They have a timer on them to tell you how many reps minutes it's been since you're set ended. There's a hook. Just stick to your drink on. And there's a ledge to put your phone on. These fancy machines don't have any of those things. They don't take into consideration what you're actually doing when you work out. You do have an intro workout drink. You do have a phone to keep track of your log. 15, at 180. So I'm also out of runway on this machine. Next week I'm obviously going to do the full maximum because if I got 15, the 10 ultimate setting, this is why Jeremy said the machine is too light. This because he does it first. I'll do it first next week. Then I'll move it to position two. We'll wait another two minutes. That dude's struggling. He's a bad muffo. He's got the prison strut. He's ready for a back loading. No, I don't think I'm in. Oh man. Oh man. No, man. I love you, force. Oh man. 9 9 fucking alright so I went up to three sets and I went to four sets, but on Saturdays I'd use six sets because I don't get sore from four sets and I've got, till Tuesdays before I hit it again. Plus this gym is the only gym that has more than one decent chest machine. It's got amazing chest machines. Like these three machines are fucking the best chest machines anywhere. So I'm hitting my incline close to get upper chest and triceps, inner head triceps. Then I hit close grip flat, which gets more medial upper, more like this fiber, rather than this fiber, this more like this fiber, and I'm getting my whole trice up. Then I do the panata, close grip, gets all the trice up, and then I do the deep part, which gets the chest and the stretch and the position, but it also gets the triceps again. Then tomorrow's trice up day. This isn't even trice up day. Oh, we're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. We're up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. gj Where the hell did I be? Woof! Thought about it or nothing so fun I would kill you And hide behind I thought I was either getting fondled or having a stroke, but in a sense it was water getting between my belt and my lap. I got 2020, 2020 so far. I don't think I did that that good on Tuesday. Ooh! Big stenders. And I was sore for the first time in like for over. For a bird. For a movie's at front. For a bird. For you, tell me, got rid of else. I wanted to think I saw the bath from you. If he, I hope he died in there if he's in there just so long. Then I'll feel bad. To be with me. Good. Mmmm! Mmm. Ahh. Huh.? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. There we are. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're sorry. Sorry. You're sorry. Yeah. Oh. You're sorry. Oh. Yeah. Yeah Yeah give me the f to know All right. We're all done with the workout part and now it's time to pull it. We're all done with the workout part and now it's time to work.
