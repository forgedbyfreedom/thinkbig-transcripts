You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. I have actually never had an intro before. Oh, God, I'm curious to see how this goes. I've got to find a water fountain. I've got to see where is one. I think it's in the bathroom. I'll be a little more careful. I found one. I'll be right back. I'm going to start with this because it's pretty chillier here. I'll take it off after like two sets. We'll get the water at. Right over there. I never had an intro or a STEM-free free workout since like I was 19. So I'm going to see how this goes with any luck. I'll look as big as he does by the end of this. All right, buddy. You want to start with a banana fly or the other banana fly. You leave the way by the heart. Prior to today, I have not really trained other than once since April. So since when? April. Oh, wow. That's why I'm so fucking small. So I'm like, yo, anything goes right now. Is this going to be a deep of enough stretch? One can always find that real quick. So you want to see how we do it here in Texas? You might think this is just a fany pet. But, uh, maybe keeping the fun stuff in here. I just got them. They're going to stretch on those. Oh, okay. There's rat really much stretch at this. I know. That doesn't give you much range of motion. No, if you lower the seat does it help at all. I tried that. Oh, damn. That's just not my time. Here we go. Let's do awkward. Let's do awkward. Let's try the other ones. Good. Wait a sec. Do this comes forward. That's just for this. Yeah. So these handles are just going to be in the way. Right. So this again, there's no range of motion on this. Those handles must just be for rear delk. Oh, this sucks. That one's unfortunate. All right. Why isn't there another one over this way though? There's this one. This is like gody-locked in the three bears. Yeah. She's just trying to train. That's it. Better? With the fork. That's new. Oh, that's, I think it's rear delk right now. Wow, so why want that? I want the extra stretch. Fock. Here we go. And this one was just. That's summer. That's summer-inged motion. There we go. With that guy's gun, there's a motion, there's a motion, there's a motion with those two are. Ooh. I'm actually getting the, every time that I come back to this gym, because I've come to the gym like twice now, I get closer and closer to saying, Screw it. I'm going to actually get a membership here. Guys, the gym I go to, don't get me wrong. It's great. But it just doesn't have all of the things that we have here. You have one five machine. And if it doesn't work for you, oh, do that. So. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. It's a little bit better. It's a little bit better. Yeah. Somewhere in your motion to it. Do you remember to reach out five machines that you'd still on his phone? All right. Let's see how this goes. I've never done this before. So damn, it's like getting put in the stock. Oh, yeah. Oh, I like that. It's a lot of range of motion. I go light as a fucking deepest fuck. Could have got to chest all warmed up. Yeah. So I don't have to worry about tearing it when I press. I think it was back in 2019. I was feeling really good because I was on trend. And I was like, oh, yeah, I can just real quickly rip out the 90s on a bench press. Nope. Almost tore the pen clean off the bone that year. Put me on the left. But you know, that's what happens when you're 21 and you think you're a mincible, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good shit. How like that? How like that? How like that? How bad. Oh. Look at the fucking fibers on the chest right now. That's neat. Yeah. Good job. Awesome. You're a good girl. Awesome. You're a good job. You're a good girl. Awesome. You're something I love. Yeah. Awesome. There's a road to the ice. It's awesome. Nice, very nice. Nice, well off. I got a little something. Yeah, cause... How I'm kind of curious. Yes. The other... I know all the ways, yep. I'm just gonna go. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna go. Who the f*** is there? Come on. Last one. Yeah. Damn it. All right. I think it really liked the stretch on that. When nice roomed up now, he's still texting. So he can't use that machine. Um... I don't know. It's a subtle call out. Oh. I'm just gonna go. All right. We need some weight on there. So it heights good. Oh. There's no pin. That's why it felt so light. That... that hat. Let's see. Is there another one to steal? Nope. Well, that's a predicament. The fuck do we do? Maybe front desk has something. Wait. I have an idea. I got this. I got this. We got a pin. All right. Take it. Okay. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Good chance. Come on. Come on. Good. Good. See that. That was like perfect. 12 reps. I'm the dot. I just guess to make him a perfect. I'm glad to see how much strength I got left after not training for fucking ever. You're a tank, holy shit. That's like nothing for you. Pressing was my like semi strong thing. What way is this at right now? Doesn't matter. It's too light for you. It's in a hundred and a time. It's okay. I started with half of staff. Yeah, that's not too bad. Good little one by one. Yeah. I lost count. I'm sure that's a warm up for you. That doesn't count. That's a bullshit set for you. I can definitely tell that I slipped. I slipped on my side last night. This shoulder is like, you know that little sore feeling you get up in the collarbone when even like sleeping like this at the whole night. Yeah. I'm feeling that right now. You know they say though. If you've slept wrong when your shoulder just don't want an extra plate, it'll even out. Right? Got that. This is a trick for that. Good. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. You got more. Perfect. Let me see what I can do. Got that little one. 50 pass. See what happened. I like how they're. We're out in the back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can do that. I don't want 50 pass. See what happened. I like how they have deep breaths. We're out in the back. I'm even talking. Do you know? No. So hear me out. Hear me out. We have warmed up. Actually, no. Not five machines. We did your hip abduction. Yeah. Your bandwork. Then we tried five machines warmed up. And we're on set number two of the world. And they have been talking. So the whole time. All right. I'm like, I'll tell you. I want that machine. That's at least a hundred calories burned just from moving to lift. Let's go. Yes, sir. What happens if you come all the way down with it? And then pause at the bottom. Do you have more chest that way? I feel really just all filters that. Oh, really? Okay. What did you bring? Like you're doing a pull down. Pull down. And then come up. There we go. No, I felt that a shit ton more. Pull down. Here you go. That's why it was so satisfying to lie. That's why you're such a less wathen. It's hard to fuck like you at my way. Yeah, I was like, did they go in? I'm not. Feelin' this the way I need to, but that changed to that change. Yeah, I'll probably drop down on 140 next for that. Yeah, it's a little stiff, get coming in out. Didn't it? On, uh, get that pinned in there. Now we're gonna switch grips to try and suck more. Word. Get more of a chain of tests with elbows or forward. That's it. So rough. There we go. Oh, and inner grip now. You can keep doing the other grip. Nice. I like to change it up. I put it on one time I made it lighter. You're now to lift up on the handle so get it in. That should be good enough. No, it's not. But I'm, so, that's up. There we go. There we go. He is there. Come on. Yeah, now I like that. Yeah, I like that there. And scapular attraction on the way down. Pause at the bottom. There you go. There you go. Keep those elbows in a little closer. So we're going to move on a little closer. So we're going to move on a little closer. Do it now. There we go. There we go. Come on down. Come on down. Good shot. Okay. That's all. That's all. I definitely'm going to drop down to one ten. Let's take a look at these. The titties feel like full. Trying to go for that dolly part of the arrow pump right now. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, now it's not hard. Check this shit out. You got his intro. Did he find your intro? We have blueberries and creamer ice. Blueberries. Pimmer ice. Oats. Oh, shit. This is why he's as big as he is. So you're a pianist. I don't mean it. That's why I'm not that big anymore. Really hot ten here. With secret creamer ice. There he is. White rice. Back. Coffee grinder. Look the rice on the ball. Be nervous. Spend up for a couple minutes. Beautiful creamer rice. The rather than buying it. Not even buying it. No additives. Here, rice. We have a little electric kettle. He's up. He'll want to want to have a racer. I used to do that. The orange box has a lot of iron in it. I would take cow roast rice and put in a vitamins and do the same thing. And it worked out nice. Come on. He goes all the same tight. He like a man's. Yeah, the shield is good right here. Wait. Come on. Double. There you go. Double. There you go. Double. Double. There you go. You have those upper fibers right there. Double. Double. Double. Come on. Come on. That's it. All right. Cool. I'm getting like a solid six with that. So we got two sets of packed deck. Four sets of processes. How much volume do you normally do for shots? Again, at this point, I've nothing. We want to move on and start doing some back. That's good. All right. We can probably work you with no well. We get some get the rear belt if you want. I don't want to hit rear belt before back. What if I get the rear belt? We got chest. All right. Let's see how this goes. I've used this machine. I think one at the Arnold. Classic. Got that more circular. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. That's my favorite touch up pull down. This and that, the Nata, one arm row, I like. Yeah. I just don't like doing it first because there's too much weight. I get you. And then something too much braising. There you go. to There we go. That's it. So, I'm gonna trick, I think, as anterior pelvic tilt, chest forward and chest up, driving the elbows forward to get the lower left. Yep, I see it up, feel that. I would keep my head up. There you go. Yeah, I wish I had this machine on my other hand. Just fucking phenomenal. Nice. I have not felt connection like this on a lap, well don't know why. Right here, right? Yep. That feels great. I hope I'm half as good at lifting weights as you are at posing. I'm not going to hold so. That's what would be worse if you're trying to fucking do that. I've got to do the point right now. Pull over machine that probably sucks ass. Yes. I've never used a baller machine that didn't suck at. There was one ever that I used. That wasn't awful. But it was in New Jersey. The change rhythm, not a lesson Pittsburgh. I was gonna say, powerhouse Pittsburgh is the one time. Yeah, actually there is that one too. There's two. There's one in New Jersey at Iron Culture. That's a good one too. Which one is this house again? This is a world famous gym. I just, when you said it, I've picked up a lot of things. Make sure the hog when I think of it. I don't think of it house again. Oh yeah. Close you, we'll do corn hog. I forget that. This is nice. This is a huge difference. That 50 pound. I'll be straight up. I'm feeling the fuck out of this pop product. But I don't. That's perfect. Right there. You see, you feel the pop product? Film off. Fuck out of it right now. Good. I'm like, I never take anything ever. I'm more like, I'm either gonna take steroids or nothing at all. But holy shit, I'd be willing to take that again. It's like every day we go to a gym that's better than every other gym I've been to my life. Every gym in Texas is better than every other gym I've been to. That's me. I know that feeling. When I came here from Georgia, I just say in Georgia you learn to make do. All right. With the exception of like madhouse, man, house gym is kind of hippy. But like with the exception of that gym, everything in Georgia is like whatever. It's like crunch gym is in plan of fitness. And when you come here and it's like what the fuck did you do two scoops of the pre and two scoops of the intro? Yeah, the double. I mean, that was Roman when he had hair. Say what? I mean, they just showed Roman up there for a second. Roman's competing like I think today. Where are women? Him and hers are not doing italy, but some other show in Germany. Like the fight for the tennis games. Huh? It's the tennis games. Yeah. Actually, waiting for that one because I'm going to be covered a little bit on that in a second here. So I fucking video that I made on hers with the thumb tape. Yeah. I'm sitting on like half a million views on the right now. I believe it. All right. That video has been the source of all of my new content because you know, I'm doing the call out videos now. Right. I did not anticipate it going off that hard, but when here's how it fucking happened. I have to bribe you. So you don't do a call out video on my posing a team. No, no. No. We ain't getting out worried about that. It's like scientific shit. It's like I was like, I thought of it. I need a bribe to scare all. So this shit doesn't call me up. When I just made friends with her, it's so fresh. It's just like, I'll be out there. Views how that fucking video went down though. So 11 30 at fucking night. I'm laying down. I'm like, oh, wow, it's just one because I'm seeing body bills without orders in those places covered. And someone commented and tagged, you know that guy, Daniel Coffee? So he's like a, he's like up like one of the biggest posing coaches right now in the US when it comes to this type of thing. Oh, damn. Yeah. Someone's called Captain Dan. Because it was Lieutenant Dan and then we turned Captain. He was like, now I can't come into Lieutenant Dan. I was like, I was actually his coach in 2017. I was his first coach. That's the same. It's crazy how small this fucking world is. Yeah. Someone's been here. It got up my mouth like mine. Everyone knows you do are eventually. I was surprised, honestly, that I haven't gotten in more fights with the shit that I thought so. I won't be straight up. But this fucking guy comments and tags Daniel in is like, hey, look at Earth's thumb take. You should make a video on this. I'm making a video. Oh, man. Anyone else. So I said a fucking alarm on my phone. We'll go a bit 730 in the morning, maybe the video and post it. Half a million views. And now I'm like, well, shit. That's what happens when you just, you see an opportunity and you fucking jump on it. And that's why I'm like trying to stay on top of everything else that's going down with the show. Smart. Now, what if we drove our chest up as we pull our elbows down? Like that? Yeah. I'm feeling that more rear deliating. I'm glad. Then do what you're doing. It helps me externally rotate better when I keep my chest that's had bit lower for some reason. That's a nice and solid 12. Normally, I would do two sets, but this is so good. I'm going to do three sets. That was my third. What is it? I was yours second, which is how you added this way. Oh, you're right. Yeah. I didn't count the first set. Oh, oh, oh, my lord, I really did get enough stuff over. Go on. Well, there's something downstairs. Oh, oh, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. will do alright. kir pushing. right B low arm All right, that's good one, ma. This is a phenomenal machine. You're going out of grip right? I found that was like fast for right here. Oh, I see what you mean, yeah. I wish this one had the, uh, shit. There's a specific machine that has like the free pegs that you can put it so that it has a slightly different, uh, resistance path. This one is very, very heavy at the bottom, but then towards the top it's like next to nothing. And if I could get it to where there's a little more even from top to bottom, I'd be, I'd be loving it. But it's really heavy on top. Very, yeah. Very light on the bottom. Very light on the bottom. Yep. Like all stretch all this one. Thank you. You killed your beverage. You want me to fill it up for you again? I'm grabbing the thing. Oh yeah. Do you want more pre-intero? I might. Who knows? And we're taking the second. It just 10 to clear my second back day. I hit back on Thursday and then when he came in here, they were hitting back. I was like, we're hitting back. So this is the pre-workout. Yeah. That's the brand. That's my brand. Finish fury. Okay. And then this is the intro, which is on Amazon right now. That is supposed to be on Amazon. They just haven't put it up. I'll be. That'll be. That'll be. That'll be. Okay. Now I'll be looking at both of those guys. Again, I've never been one to put much stock in them before, but theoretically I should not have a pump right now because I have not eaten yet today. And it's fucking 330. All right. So not to be a dick. Yeah. I am the only person I've ever met who makes these who went to college for it. True. Everybody else is just some guy. No. I want to sort of supplement company and then the menu texture just white label some bullshit. Yeah. And every brand is the same. There it is. Good shit. Oh. I think this is the one lower. I'm going to go get your bathroom look like. Hey. It's hard. Like your house. This fuck they do hurt the mentions. What are you doing? What are you saying? I'm fucking funny. Men will be men. What can we say? All right. I'll tell you. It's a good thing that I'm not mic'd up 95% of the day because I swear if some of the shit that I'd be saying just on the regular was out of the record man, I'd be out of a job. I'd be. I'd be. I'd probably get shot there. All right. I'd be saying some wild shit sometimes. I didn't realize you could do everything in the head pump. Hmm. Come on now. Let's go. Yeah. Oh. Come on. Oh. Come on. Yep. That is that. Hey. Which girl was you checking out? We heard you in the head Oh. I said this is the bus gym and I said why don't we tell anyone live in Detroit when they could train here and Detroit is shit hole. This gym's fucking incredible. Why do I live in Detroit? This shit hole. Humber is cool, general. I mean I was checking out myself in the mirror in my head. Oh, that's even worse. That is even worse. I don't know what I said. I mean, huh? I don't think I said that at all. Like girls hot. This fuck they didn't heard the mention is perfect. Oh, oh, oh, the one on the wall, the one I wanted to do up. Yeah. Oh yeah, we got to see this now. Oh, that's fair. That's valid. That girl's. That's what I was talking about. Oh. That's what I was talking about. I was like, I can't get him at girl. He began to those anime girls. Look at that. Like I don't normally like muscular chick, but she's how his fuckers are face is him as deformed. Maybe looking for his, he'd be looking for a designer woman. Hey, on the bright side, as we start making those AI robots more more realistic, we might actually be able to do that. You know, 1599 a month. You can submit your design. They'll 3D print it. Put it on a robot. Oh, this is amazing. I want to move to Austin just with this machine. Just these two machines. It's just machines for nothing special. But then Pinnata and this Pinnata all it's amazing. I can't wait to go to Derek's gym and do all new tech equipment. Watch, I'm not going to have a sleep because my back can't hurt so much from doing so much back work, but I honestly because these are all verticals. I don't think it's hurting me. So these two I want to try them. But that's not the responsible thing to do because I have to be healthy enough to train pole with John, June on Wednesday. I'm supposed to train pole with John, June on Wednesday. So I don't want to fuck my back up with it. You're many machines. Understandable. Because you're not supposed to do this. You're not supposed to use new machines on P.s week. No. Because you'll always get sore. Yeah. But it's been working. I fucking blew up like a house. I did. Since that last show. What are you training with John? What are you training with John? Muscle factory. Oh yeah, yeah. He's over in San Antonio. I got the gym and I ran into the house right next to Muscle factory. Oh fuck yeah. So I can train there every day. Hell yeah. You should see if you can. If you have the time, try and look uh link up with Joe Jogansolish. He's a he's a men's physique pro out here. Okay. I work with a lot of his clients really good guy. Real, real good trainer too. All right. I did two sets here. How many do you do? Two or three. Two or three. Two or three? Well, if you're talking about here, I think I did two. Okay. Don't quote me on that. We did three there. We got two to do here. Let's do one more here. Okay. And then maybe we'll try this out. Maybe. Is that a row or like a? This is a row. Yeah. This one's a row. Yeah. I don't like that range of motion. But this more circular right. I'm going to try that because there's a hundred. Let's just do this. Okay. Let's just just train it out. Yeah. To make what? Straight to the circular out. You just feel what I do this? I love this. I love this. I like ropes. I'm a row kind of guy. I don't see you do eight. I'm a meal. I'm a one up on here while you hit that good. Because you probably do I can only do like two sets of rows because my upper right back is fucked up. No, I like I'll flat out go absurd on rows. My like staple movements are bent over rows and dead lists. So like this is my this is my fun stuff here. All right. Let me see what I can do. They got their own plates here. Is that you heavy? Actually yeah it's a little bit who's very up there. Who's starting to two plates? Come on. Well, when I was 220 I could but I'm a but not on a new machine. I'm a I'm a small bean now. Why don't we just once you just get the range of motion on with one? If it was a more if it was a more linear row I'd be pulling two place no problem. I'll tell you that but this outer shit. Right. It's all. It's gonna all scapure. Yeah, it's all that's all. It's all dealt for me. Yeah, that's better. It's all scapure. What is it? It's okay. Okay. That makes life a lot easier. Okay, cool. This I Wow... their statue. Their statue. Whoo. Wow. These guys are going to bombs yet. That's way too f******* happy to me. Really. 1 stat... Okay, so you work on that. I'll get like I'm gonna work do two sets over here. Okay, then we'll switch This is more lower lat. Okay, that's all up here. Oh here. Three to six sets a lot I'll do two sets of rows here if I start feeling that scapula It started a little bit, but I think it was from this nothing that Okay it That room as she was all last. You gotta be down here though, up here not so much down here. And right there, all that. I have a feeling this'll be a lot of lats too. But I know I have to not film roll out my back. Just doing that. It's not gonna tighten up. I'll do one more light set of that. And then we're done. That's nine sets of back. Six sets of shots. I'm gonna move on to shoulders. Do some lateral waves. This probably three. Actually, no way. I want to do the rear delts for a stand. Three sets of rear delts. See sets of middle delts. And there's at least one by set of at least one try. So Michelle and try. Or on the fly. You're fried. Yeah, I hit, well I hit just or back on Thursday. So I'm like kind of sore. After a bit, I was gonna move on to that rear delt machine. Sound good. Yeah, that was the one thing I haven't been on hit yet. This week was a rear delt. Yeah. Yeah. You're gonna move on to the side. Drop on your head. I'm gonna move on to the side. I'm gonna move on to the side. Yeah. Drop on your head. Yeah. Drop on your head. Yeah. So if I stood up there. It made it a little exercise. If I was sitting down, it's not lad at all. It was just my trap and the little scapula. Sorry, fucking, it's getting inflamed. The hard shit's over. Now it's a fun shit. That was the fun stuff. So six sets, six sets, six sets, last. And then I did three sets of rows. They were really just last. That's for a long arms. This is for short arms. This is for short people. Hi. Okay. This is way too hard. Way wise or what? It's really hard. It shouldn't be this hard. Give it a shot. Let's see what we got going here. I didn't feel any riddles. I said, all the trap. It's like a weird resistance point. It's like right, right, right heavy. It's a bucket. And then back to really light again. Yeah, I'm not feeling this one. Let's go use one and a well as using. Yeah, I'm with that. So we've tried the same for not a machine twice and it sucked in both directions. Now we're all in two on for notas. I'll tell you that. Well, those are good. Not a good, that one. That one over there was good to stop. But you have the penatus. I don't know how they could fuck this up. This is pretty straightforward. This is phenomenal. We're going to be a real leader. We're going to be a real leader. We're going to be a real leader. I think that's better than that. What's this called? Real leader. Real something? Yeah, real leader. We're at sun bang sun bang! All you need to do to you, sun! Tortujury, sun! I'll try to cover it on. I guarantee you take it! Let it be Rashiar. Imma fall now. You Oh, no, no, no, no. And this shenan was eyeballing for next. That dude just walked up to it. Say, well, no. So, lateral machine. That's my favorite one of those three, but he just took it. So, he got- I mean, we could theoretically work in with him. We could, but then that's creepy. When there's two ones available, they're the best. They're the best. They're the best. They're the best. They're the best. So, we could be a radically working with him. We could, but then that's creepy. That's the one that's available into him. He didn't like kick that one. He was like, well, let's just embrace it, you know? And this went with one. It's embraced. I like, hey bro, hey bro, we really like your delts. We work with you bro, and then just like, you make it progressively. Yeah, it's making us awkward as we can. Like, I like your brave. So, I'm talking to you. I like your brave. It's like, can I work in delph with you? Yeah. So, a lot of M&M and I'm gonna hear. Oh. There's a lot of M&M in here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Being from Detroit, it's hard for me to accept that people actually know who he is. Is that M&M from Detroit? M&M's from Detroit. But from Warren. Is that really from Detroit? If you watch eight miles, he lives on the north side of eight mile. Like kid rocks from a swimming height. He's not from Detroit. I see peas from Roya Lowe. They're not from Detroit. Everybody says they're, I see him from Detroit. I'm from West Bloomfield. How many since you got left? I'm just a second. I'm a second. Yeah, please. Thank you. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. So, he's so we can work in with him. Yeah. He's done. Yeah. We've got a lot of people. Yeah. He's done. Yeah. We've got a lot of people. Yeah. He's done. Yeah. We've got a lot of people. Yeah. He's done. Yeah. We've got a lot of people. He's super setting anyway. All right. Thank you. Nice meeting you too, Rich. Thanks. James. I'll still be here. I got a good trip. Okay. I got a good trip. After doubts. I got a good trip. All right. I have to say I want to go fucking do up to this shit. Yeah, go ahead. Instagram or anything, bro? Yeah. Todd Lee M.D. T.O.D. That's me. Yep. Good. Good. Good luck. Thank you. I'm glad I ate that meal first. I was angry as fuck. Remember how it was yelling about the conversations I yelled about yesterday on the car right over here. And then you fell asleep. Yeah. You fell asleep. Thank you. I got it. I was on my full conversation with you. I look over here like. I was like, okay. What? I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that's every four days isn't enough because they never stay so are so I'm going to get out of here. I'm going to bring it down to 65. That's where he had it. Yeah. That's pretty loaded in the structure position. I didn't have that strong. I just didn't have that strong. I'm going to bring it down to 65. That's where he had it. Yeah. That's pretty. That's pretty. That's pretty. That's pretty. Yeah. That's a little more of my style. See, when you're a daddy, your shoulders just aren't as big. So you don't have any strength in them. I got to get back on. I got to get back on a deep all. Hand is raw and give me another really shitty steroid. A shitty one? Yeah. A little tough. Yeah. Halo. All day. All day orals. Actually, 20 story. I did my show. I did like 50 milligrams of Halo in a single day. Uh-huh. Holy fuck. I was ready to assault somebody. I wanted to scare the other people backstage. So I snorted a line of Halo. I broke up the capsule and snorted it a whole line of it. And then my post switching was death metal. They were terrified. It's all psychological. I'm not as hardcore as him. That's all I'm like. I'm not. I'm just not that hardcore. I'm just not that hardcore. I'm just not that hardcore. Look at your face. And you know me well enough to know I'm not joking. I know that. I'm like, Finn you're going. Yeah, actually did that. I've only snorted one thing ever in my life. And it was a line of C4. And I was like fucking 15 years old. And I was told that it would hit you faster. I did it. I proceeded to like cry. Not like out of fear. But just out of fear. I just had to figure out the fucking burn so bad. And then I decided I didn't like putting things on. I'm just going to strain it. I'm out. Oh yeah, you're right. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the moral of the story is I can do as much vertical shit as I want. One set of rowing. And this levator's scapula or whatever the fucking is. Clues down. And it's going to affect my real-life spread on stage. I know what. So no rose for you right now is what I'm here. Yeah. This is my easy day. Then arms and legs would be the hard day. See, for me, my thing is it's been, I don't know, probably almost a year since I've had like a legitimate body building workout like this because I've been training but for going beyond it. I've been half-assing the fuck. I mean, that's why I mean, you can tell I've been half-ass in the fuck out of things for a while now. And doing to what I did today may be go shit, I missed this. All right. So literally I just made it my Dutch test. They did everything red. As soon as I get like the okay of like, hey, you can get back on. I'm going to be hitting on my boys and tell them, hey, we're hitting some like bodybuilder ass fucking training days moving forward because I'm tired of being a little bit, man. Oh, no. Come on now, you're a lot more. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I get forget that part. I was like that felt too like, slum, me, but that makes more sense. And if I keep my head up and shut up, I get more middle though as long as I internally rotate that humorous. Yeah, I see what you mean, yep. I felt that. There you go. What's your rep scheme? Oh, 12 to 20. Okay, good. Give them here. Right now you're rotating outward. You're actually rotating. Next time when you call it Breaker into your belt, which is how I would have hurt my, my, my rotator cuff. That would probably be why I oftentimes feel like shit after this. Yeah. They, that was more of a fatigue thing for me though, because that was my like dead rep there. Come up. Make sure to take all the slack out of this side with this side. Yeah. There we go. I got to drop the weight. I'm a little pussy today. This way this. Trash stop. There you go. I'm going to try to scrape the floor with my fist and how to the side. Oh, yeah. I'm then controlled and negative too. Fight the negative on the way down. There we go. Make it hurt. Just as much on the way down in the heart. Jump. Head up. Trash stop. There we go. There we go. Come on. Trash stop, head up. That's nine. Give me two more. I got two more. I got this. I got this. That's all you. I didn't do shit. This goes. There we go. There we go. Come on, let's get on. There we go. Here we go. One more. Jump. Um. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Squeeze. Squeeze. Get it. There you go. That's right. Come on. Come on now. Come on. You got more than one. You got more than one. Let's go. Squeeze. Again. That's all trapped. When you start going like this a little bit, immediately you can see your trap there. Go on that. Now I want to try some of these vise of tricep machines. I want to try this. I want to try that. I want to try the tomato. Try and sub-dip. Yeah, let's do it that way. Let's do tricep vise of tricep vise of. I'm going to watch you and provide commentary on this one. Simply because I've done biceps and triceps three days in a row. All right. So my arms are like dead right now. I'm like, all right. By doing it again, they're going to fall off the bone. I don't know how to use this machine for shit. All right. First, I'm going to lighten it. Second, I'm going to move the seatboard. I'm going to hang on myself. I'm going to throw this door. That's your little, all of a motherfucking. Now it's all happening. I'm going to throw this door. I'm going to lighten it. I'm going to lighten it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. It's still not much of a stretch. It's not touching the stretch, it's not showing. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't like it. Is that any stretch at all on me? All right. All right. All right, cool. All right. All right. It's not worth shooting my lot on by subs today. When I could be at the muscle factory training arms tomorrow. Because that felt like shit. This is nothing fancy. How the fuck is who does this? Oh. What kind of fucking asshole berries are placed like this? Maybe I'm retired and maybe this will work just fine. Hold on. Well, that's good for my joints. All right. That's really very. This is not as good as the one in a umber. That feels better. That feels better. That felt really good. This machine smoothers in the hammers strength, but not as smooth as the one in a umber. Of course, when you're using this at a weight, there's not a whole lot. And you go around. What the fuck is this? Have a fuck to use this. Oh, that's weird. Of course it's like that. All right. That feels good. It's an actual arm machine that doesn't hurt. I need to have longer arms use it, but I don't think it's supposed to get in my hands. That was great. Well, looks like I'll be doing biceps at muscle factory tomorrow, because I can easily squeeze six sets of triceps in right now. There's so many fucking fun pieces of equipment. I could literally move here and spend months just training at this gym. I wanted to move to Dallas for absolute recarmp. But fuck, I could do it if I could train with Hunter or Terrence for a few months. I would move to Houston, train with Josiah here, and be his workout partner. I don't know how I could nap coyote from our key for months on end. I know he'd come with me to Dubai, because that sounds like a lot of fun. Dubai would be fun if shit. I would be like, yeah, I would be proud. Yeah, yeah I would be proud. So it's true, true, true, true, true, true, true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you want me to do? All right, I will definitely jump now, Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now. All right, this is the right way. I'm going to do two working sets here at this way. Then I'm going to wrap up with a few sets here. Now, now, now, now, now. Well, just the final game. Now, now, now, now. Now, now. Now, now, now. Now, now, now. Now, now, now. Now, now, now. We're going to have to wait. I'm going to have to think a full rest period just to do this. I thought I could do it as a superset. It's a squeeze out of a few reps, but I'm going to even get five. A lot of people would be like, oh, it's so irresponsible of you to do some arms when arms are tomorrow, but I don't know if I'm ever going to get a chance to try a panata dip machine, or whatever the fuck this is, a panata monolith alternate arm extension. Like, this very, very, very few bicep machines give you a stretch. Very, very, very, very few. Try some machines. Don't hurt my elbow. So, it's important for me to find machines that don't hurt me. Like, very few roll machines hit your last. So, I found amazing lap pull down for a panata, two panata machines that are amazing lap pull down. And I found a way to make two panata machines that were rows hit my lap. So, this was an amazing lap workout today. The chess workout, it was a not-alisten client press, which I've used before. And we had a jury rig, the not-alist pack deck. You know, the Chastee equipment, something fancy. Humble is not much better chance than put more. So, as long as you as I'm going to do it back off set for my final set, a lot of people figure out what I'm figuring out. I'm probably too tired to really get a good arm workout. So, even though I'm throwing six sets at this, six sets today, wouldn't be as effective as six sets tomorrow, fresh. But, if I don't give an effective arm, try to work out, then that try to, try to, won't be sore tomorrow, and there's no reason I can't just do it again tomorrow. And if I over-trained my triceps, that's okay, because I'm not hitting them again until Friday. You see what I'm saying? The best. Oh my God, look at that full contraction I just got. Holy hell. I'd be even better if the nogha-hide wasn't ripped, so I didn't have rancid infected tissue. Being carved into my skin, so I can get so you like this. With your eyebrow, cufflacks, and a McMaster. Look at that. There's almost rubber. I barely feel what's happening with them. I think it's time to call it a quid. Like, I can feel a pump physically, but I can't internally feel a pump. I couldn't when I got off the atmosphere. This is making me lose my pump and I know that I'm going to sound like a pussy, but this plastic that's ripped, this is gonna cost cellulitis. That's an infection under the skin. If it's with staff of caucus areas, which is a flashy bacteria, you can get necrotizing fasciitis, and you'll lose a part of your arm. Probably should urinate, do abs, and instead of having a protein shakes, it's already had four of my six waters for the day. I probably should just eat a solid food meal, and then get on the road for the other Airbnb. Everyone thinks I'm silly for black towels, but then when you have paint all over you, and you get out of a shower, and you wipe off in a hotel towel, they charge you $250 for every towel you fuck up. So if you only have black towels, then when you take your towels with you, you don't have to worry about what towels you take. Black towels don't cost more money. We're got our Alaiiindea. Seriously, it's so hard for people to understand how exciting this is for me. Imagine if you were a Leonardo da Vinci and you went through a time portal and you met Nicola Tasselah and then Ada's brain and got to know everything he knew and you had a backstest to electricity. That's how I feel like getting into a real gym like this. To where I can actually use equipment that was made by smart people rather than equipment made by fucking more on. Like we've been stuck with the hammer strength bullshit for 30 fucking years while the rest of the civilized world has panata and then his brand has never even heard of like Bolt Terence's new line that's fucking awesome and then this not-a-list stuff has been around for the 1970s. For some reason Michigan doesn't have not-a-list equipment. Michigan is like the armpit of planet Earth and I don't know why I'm there. I feel like I should put it a little bit before we get in the car for a while. It's funny how like my third set was what? My second set was like three reps. My third set was like one and if I waited two more minutes would it have gotten me any more reps and else. I got a little overzealous with the back thing. Honestly it's not that tight. My lats are completely loosened up right now. I'm feeling a little bit of my lower back where my glute is attached but that could be where the so-es attaches it anteriorly to the issue. Look at that though. Look at that mural. It's so much better than looking at another picture of Jay-Kartler. You know what I mean? Like every gym is the same played out 2009 footstime. Not that that's not a great picture but that's unique. If I had a gym I wouldn't want to be up. Jay-Kartler's nuts. I would want my own gym with my own identity. That is like the coolest fucking thing. Which funny is species also so they're the mecca of the south. Do you know what? I don't know if they know what mecca means. I wouldn't call my place mecca. I would call it capital. I would call it bodybuilding capital of wherever the fuck I want. Because mecca does not mean capital. It means the place of pilgrimage. It's with a singing black rock. I think I've got some pain right here. A little bit of elevator scapula. I'm going to try to do this this way. This trick is to alleviate not annihilate. Now this ain't happening. Oh there we go. Do you know what's so funny? I forgot Amanda's a massage therapist. She could have worked on this. God that was so stupid of me. That's what she fucking does for a living. She's a massage therapist. Fuck I'm retarded. Well I feel like I put an effective work day in I think I should probably eat meal three here before we get on the road. So we're done here house games in front of the coolest mural that ever existed. Awesome equipment. Every gym we go to a more impressed than the previous gym with how amazing the equipment is. The only gym that comes anywhere close to this is Umbra and Michigan and that's just just and legs. But every one of these gyms has like every panadopiece of equipment. It's so amazing.
