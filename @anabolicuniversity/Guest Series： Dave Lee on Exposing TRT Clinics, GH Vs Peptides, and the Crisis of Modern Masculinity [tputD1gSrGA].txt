Worry! You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV, where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. Why don't you tell us your backstory, the origin story of Dave Lee? Yeah, sure. So I didn't really have any interest in science early in my life. I was a musician. So I was primarily a drummer and then I got sick of setting up the drums and packing him down after shows. And my friend from school who was a drummer also at the time gave me the option to jump in on vocals for his band right before we did an album. And that was going to my full-time thing. I went to the Western Australia Academy performing arts, got a certificate in contemporary music and then realized that getting a full-blown degree in music is a waste of time. So I ended up getting a business degree in commerce and kind of ran that for a while. I was doing Facebook campaigns back when you could first do like the targeting and the retargeting from the website business and stuff. And everything was going to go in really crazy and then one day I just woke up like I'd spun around on a chair 50 times, fell into my wardrobe. Never really had any health stuff going on. And that continued for years. I had severe vertigo. Every doctor told me it couldn't be fixed. Everyone told me it couldn't be recovered. It took me a year and a half to get a proper diagnosis. And then they said that the stipular neuritis comp healed the nerves damage. So I went back to university. I started testosterone replacement therapy out of desperation to be able to get through what looked like a hopeless rehabilitation journey. And got to post graduate diploma in biomedical science proceeded to start a masters in your psychiatry as a science. Realized that I wasn't interested in drugging people. I thought I was going to learn about how to heal the brain, not how to prescribe a whole bunch of nonsense. So I dropped out of that and eventually put together a protocol with some rehabilitation using BPC back before people were then you about it. Once I did that, I didn't really have any interest in doing anything else except for helping people with their health. So I just basically I did health coaching, but I thought I kind of made up health coaching at the time because no one was really doing it. And I wanted to advocate for TRT to spread the awareness of how it was what a lot of people were looking for. And over five or six years of doing this all day, every day forever wrote a few books, graduated to, I guess, being what I would go and educate her. I trained a lot of practitioners all over the world. I own a clinic in Australia, a clinic here in Europe and I have some partners in the US. And now I primarily educate. I still work with some clients, but I mainly try to educate on a lot of the similar stuff that you do, which is how to do this stuff right because a lot of people need it, a lot of people are doing it now. And 99% of people are doing it wrong. And I don't know why because it's not that complicated. I know why. It's because the TRT model yours and non-cluded is you got this guy who's like, oh look at all those money I could be making. So he basically is either opens a TRT clinic in higher sombatical director that doesn't know they're asked from a whole the wall. And then they get body builders to be customer care representatives. And so they're basically telling people to do one heart-poon injection every four days with a hundred tests and a half of an arimidex. And then the doctor doesn't know any about it. So he just signs off on it because it still fits within the legal guidelines. Cut ahead eight ten years later that's the standard. So there's this blind leading the blind emperors new clothes situation going where they're all meet in the summits and basically conventions and pat each other on the back about what great job they're doing doing the same stupid bullshit that makes no sense. And because they got the the biggest clown of them all and his sidekick Robin are now co-authors with the antibiotics textbook that you have the dumbest lease educated people in the space writing the textbook for all of these TRT clinics. So even if you were a doctor who's under 30 and open-minded and you decide you want to learn how to do it right the only material you have is the antibiotics book which is completely wrong. When I came to the Olympia a couple of years in a road to to speak and doing some like educational workshops. The stuff that like I guess I'm in my echo chamber of people who also know what they're doing and when I was presenting the idea of like breaking up injections and just the basics like you know not using arimidex and addressing the underlying health problems that people are having. It was like people's eyes were just wide at this idea of just what I thought everyone kind of worked out five because in Australia there's like less than 10 clinics in eastern Europe there's one which is Mike Lane and then when I came to the US I hadn't been before and I landed and in the Uber there was an add on the radio for TRT and I was like what the fuck I was like this is crazy. I went out staying in my friend Ali I was like there are more clinics within a five mile radius of your house than the entire country of Australia. This is just it blew my mind so I wasn't aware of how bad it was because I mean I've been educating on how to do it right for a long time and I didn't realize how massively massively ridiculously industry is and how many people are having probably more harm than good done to them by these ridiculous protocols and you know my undergrads in business and as we saw in the last podcast it's a much more efficient business model to sell three things to your hundred guys than one thing to three hundred guys. So they have this whole fries in the coke model like McDonald's don't make much margin on the burger they make margin on the fries in the coke and if you can get a guy on like a discovery call and then freaking out by saying oh you'll be in the first dollar if you don't take HcG and you'll grow tips and you don't take a remodax it's like the easiest sale ever and then it's a reoccurring revenue so it's a very unethical extortioned business model and I think that there is a warm seat in hell reserved to people who exploit people who are looking for medicine I think that that's just fun. What's also extremely unethical is for a doctor to sell drugs that's why we have pharmacists because then you're incentivized to prescribe and these worthless sons of bitches prescribed Tasmaraylan and others secretive dogs because they know the patient can't afford the GH but you're prescribing something that is in the drug and so all these ignorant people they think they're getting prescription peptides when peptides research compounds a peptide is a protein-based hormone it's not what people think it is people think peptides are something that is an illegal antibiotics steroid that's what they think of peptides and you can't prescribe these peptides these secretive dogs because the research compounds they're not real drugs yet and if they were real drugs it'd be a different story but they're not they're these camp on fire missies are buying them from a wholesaler out of China the same wholesaler that's selling them to all of the gray market sites that are research camp websites so these guys are paying $200 a pop for Tasmaraylan because they think it's cheaper than GH and you're saying now you don't shit you're paying more money for the Tasmaraylan than you would be the VGH if GH was cheap through the pharmacy secretive dogs wouldn't exist because the only benefit of them is the cheaper I mean it's and I think the kind of everyone has to go through this like red pilling of realizing how fucked the traditional medical system is because it's all just a it's all just business and it's not ethical business but I was very mind-blowing in terms of how a lot of these countries handle these research chemicals because I'm looking at them and be like these haven't been approved they haven't even been studied in humans yet and it seems as though as long as the pharmacy can make it the doctors will just prescribe it until they get in trouble like I thought that things had to be approved first it turns out you can just prescribe it at the fucking one and then you might pay for it later if you get ordered it but in the interim you can make some good banks so if you find a doctor who doesn't give a fuck and they just want to make as much money as quickly as possible and then you get a whole bunch of influences and given a affiliate code for it who also don't know what don't care about what they're doing you can create a really profitable really harmful business and people like myself and people like you I mean where where here to basically I mean I try to put out as much educational affordable and free content as possible that people can actually understand so that they can read this stuff and at least be able to have an informed perspective before they get sucked in by these credits well part of the problem is people think I hated peptides, baff can march because I did a video that was talking about how they're just terrible students, terrible students they don't hear what you say they remember how they felt based on what they thought you said what I was saying was I hate secretive dogs and peptides because they're bullshit and everything is just a poor man's GH and then I went on to see how the HRT clinics are ripping people off and I'm sort of prescribing GH they're prescribing it's a creed of dogs at 100 times the price and then they're prescribing mk677 and some a gluteide so they're prescribing something then increases appetite and then something that decreases appetite and so they're all crooks and so people who are previously my friends were mad because they thought I was putting them down because they had affiliate codes to peptides whereas I didn't have a negative opinion of mkc I like botc I like mk7 I like tb 500 I'm pretty fucking sure I said that in the same goddamn video but because it was at the end of the video these dumb fuck stop listening it was a 90 second video it's not my fault you've got TikTok brain and you stupid son of a bitch can't listen for 90 seconds to hear the whole thought that you get buttsore and then it's shut it off and throw your phone against the wall because you're an emotional wreck because you fried your brain and try to acetate in a hundred milligrams every other day but like there's a lot of really good peptides but the I when people say peptides generally they're talking about secretic ox which are garbage and it's also about the context and the application for it so when I was dealing with this nerve issue in my inner ear I basically landed on this idea that if I had an intravenous stem cell infusion that could help which was like 30 grand or 40 grand and I had no money but I was like I'll get a loan I'm desperate and I booked him with this doctor who did it and he took the appointment and he walks me and he goes he goes I'm not giving you a stem cell treatment and I'm like why am I here he's like I had what you had and I was like holy shit and he goes he's like I can't prescribe this you didn't hear this from me but this is what you need and he writes down bbc 1,5,7 and a piece of paper this was like back in 2017 or something so you know this was very novel at the time and that combined with all the rehab and all the supplements I stacked with it because like what you've talked about before there's an entourage effect when you combine things with different pathways to achieve the stem outcome you know one plus one equals three and you know that saved my life but now I'm seeing a whole bunch of people being like oh just run maintenance load those bpc all the time to help you with gym recovery I'm like yeah that's it that's a good cell but that's fucking bullshit and it's my friend Dr. Keith Nichol said it a while ago he said it very well he goes all the stuff that people are looking for peptides to do in the wrong situation is what growth hormone does and Rand and I was like that's exactly true if you look at all the things that people are trying to achieve with just I want to take peptides because I heard about it online and sounds cool and you know I I want to you know whatever I'm like what you're looking for is growth hormone these peptides are incredibly beneficial if they are indicated for a specific purpose but otherwise the only benefit you're going to get is a hole in your wallet. When I get all the time as people who got to hold me they're like I saw your videos about master on and it sounds great I want to try it I'm like well then you didn't understand the videos at all I'm saying that master on is a good drug to use once you've exhausted testosterone and you can't possibly use any more testosterone before it gets toxic because master on is testosterone's less toxic little brother it's not stronger than testosterone and theory it could be weaker than testosterone it's something you would add in to get a clean and a ballic effect once you've maximized testosterone and GH you haven't maximized testosterone you haven't maximized GH furthermore you don't add drugs until you fail in the gym you your logbook indicates you're still getting stronger you have not failed yeah and it's it's the same with it with the TNT stuff because I mean I have like a I guess interest in steroids from like mechanistic theory but I'm exclusively a bio identical hormone kind of person and I get guys all the time being like I want to push up my TNT dose and I'm like you want to feel more masculine so you've attributed the idea that if you take multi-salture and it's going to make you more manly and for people who aren't initiated into the space like I can see that logic I mean it's wrong but I can see the the logic and they're in a scenario where I'm like no you've already got your testosterone levels through the fucking roof the reason why you don't feel like the man that you want to be is because you're not living like that guy you're not doing all this stuff and you're not this you're not the outcome of someone who's done that consistently for ages that has built themselves into this person with bravery and resilience and courage and integrity and always different things and up in your TNT dose past the point that is at the upper limit of their human physiology which is not the fucking reference range I mean that's just you but once they get past that point it's like you're just going to get side effects you're not going to get what you're looking for because they're just wanting to basically inject something to do the character development for them and I'm like I understand that desire to do that but the problem is they'll find a doctor who just do whatever the patient tells them to do and then they go back to the doctor and they complain about the side effects of the things that they twist their arm to do whereas a good doctor or a good practitioner if someone doesn't benefit from something I mean I thought the hypocrite goes was real I thought there was this do-know harm thing but apparently that's not a thing it's a myth you don't have to tell the say the oath I did the oath but I only one I know who did it so the other thing is it's why I say all the time like people will be ready to buy and then they're like oh well I gotta go talk to my wife first I'm like let me get this straight your goal is to take testosterone to become more masculine probably because you want your wife to find you attractive and your solution is to go ask your wife permission to become more masculine who's money is this mine the why the fuck do you ask her what you do with your money they're like well I want to stay married I'm like do you want to stay married and be it or do you want to be a man and then they'll be like well blah blah blah blah I'm like what they are too stupid to realize is if they were assertive and masculine and behavior in the first place their wife wouldn't stop fucking them so they wouldn't think that they need the shot to be more masculine so their wife goes back to fucking but nothing is more castrating than to ask permission from your basically a non-working employee like if you support your wife and she doesn't cook in clean you have a maid and a nanny and all these other things all she is is like an adopted adult you adopted this adult that you pay for it's like who the fuck is she to tell you what you can do with your money now don't get me wrong I've had guys come to me and say hey my wife makes all the money it's her money so I have to ask her permission I'm like okay and in my mind I'm like that's still not masculine all the testosterone in the world isn't going to make you feel like a man if your your wife's ward if you're like robbing to your wife's Batman like so these men they have no concept of even what masculinity is and then they think that they can fix their marriage problems by shooting up on tester I don't have much of a sex drive and I want and then they start using testosterone like my sex drive still isn't there and like dude you're 50 years old do you think maybe you're just bored a pussy at this point like how much do you have to have before it's just like it's not fun anymore it's like every notice how little kids will watch a Disney movie over and over and over and over and over and it never gets boring but if we watch a movie twice we're like okay I'm good I don't need to see it a third time maybe once every 10 years you watch your favorite movie it's like after you had sex with the same woman five times a week for 20 years you've had sex with here what is that 250 times you've 5,000 times it ain't gonna get me more fun at some point it's gonna wear off so it's and it's not and after it's about 50 girls whatever the 51st girls not can be the magic bullet it's not gonna be different this time it's been the exact same as all other 50 girls at the sex drive thing they think they're not men if they don't have this overwhelming sex drive and it's like no you just grew out of it it's just at some point roller coasters aren't fun anymore once your body fits under 10% and your 200 pounds roller coasters suck you feel like you're in a pinball machine if you're 40 pounds and you're a big blueberry blob like a child it's like 50% fat and 50% muscle in bone balancing around in that speed is fun but if you're 200 pounds that's four times as much force that's slamming you into the hard um what do you call it fiberglass and metal it's it's something that comes up all the time and I think that so one of the things I was originally interested in when I one of the other reasons I wanted to look into durus likeiatry is that I wanted to work out why so many people just had this like a low grade kind of defensive syndrome like they didn't want to kill themselves but they didn't want to get a bad kind of thing and I really think and you know a lot of these guys they don't need a prescription to multi-stoster and they need a prescription for the rational male by roller to mercy and they need to read it and understand it but when it comes to you know what what these guys are seeking they're just seeking novelty and there's a you know the human brain is why it's a novelty to some degree but when you mature I think that the real thing that we all need the kind of overrides all of that is that we need to be proud of ourselves like being proud of yourself is the best it is the panacea for mental health issue and then you know Jordan Peterson says it very well which is that like you know competence creates confidence and when all these guys that they tell me that they're anxious and like you know anxious you're afraid and you're afraid because you're incompetent and you're incompetent because you haven't applied yourself because you've been chasing novelty this whole time and you know going back to having like the libido that you had when you first found out that your dick worked like that's not going to improve the circumstances of your life that if anything that's just going to make a worse. How is say do you want to become a hero and have it and they're like no I'm like why do you want okay so you don't want to have an addiction to a drug that's readily available that has a fixed price has a dealer that's happy to deal then why the fuck would you want to be addicted to something that has no dealer available and even if you do find a dealer she may not sell it to you that sounds extremely frustrating I was you know I feel that this is going to be popular the whole economy of genitals is set up so that the vagina is worth more than the dick and the reason that is is because women pressure men into thinking if you don't have a higher sex drive than me you're not a real man so that there's this pure pressure that men have on them from society really it's women that they need to constantly be going and trying to have sex with women then on top of that women because they're not that good at manipulation of verbally abused men by telling them all men care about his sex and all men and our cheaters and they put men down for having the sex drive that they want them to have because the higher they've convinced men their sex drive needs to be the more power the woman has sexually over men because if women didn't have power sexually over men then men would have no reason to pay for them and support them if the genitals were equal women would probably starve to death because most of them don't have jobs that pay enough to meet their lifestyle and it's I've seen so many guys I think I think it's sterling Cooper who was saying that the red pills are supposed to are going to get to be a guy the older you take it and that is one of the truest things I've ever heard and you can use a condom to protect from sexually transmitted infections but you can't use a condom to protect you from getting entangled with a girl with borderline personality disorder and the worst thing that these guys do and it's so prevalent all over the world of particularly in Western countries is that they become entangled with someone who's a sociopath and who is an abuser and who is actually who has an anti-social personality disorder and their entire I mean best case scenario they get on a complete awful trajectory and their life ends up not being alive that they're proud to live but worst case scenario they get slapped with a lawsuit they get slapped I mean you've got to fit they get a pregnant and then they end up in a broken home relationship where there's now entangled but someone for the rest of their life who's mentally ill and destructive and it's it's so common especially where I mean these guys are fishing in a poison pond on Tinder and it is it is so common and it is so risky and you know guys will that a woman's a marry her but they won't vet a woman to stick their dick in her and it is it is just is potentially risky and you just you see how these outcomes go I mean guys don't have their lives together they're just chasing approval of women who are never going to be approving of them you know rich group that has that very good saying that women hang out at the finish line and fuck the winners and men don't realize how true that is and it's it's the I really believe just from my own experience because I mean I just crueced up until my kind of you know I was like 26 27 I was like oh I'm just going to do at least a amount of work I can and just you know you kind of just chill and play video games and hang out and then I got this real fire at my house being like no I I want to get to the point when I'm you know 40 if you've to use old where I've built a life that I'm really fucking proud to live and I can honestly say that I almost got to railed by these kind of women a bunch of times but I was fortunate enough that I pulled out of it before there was a big problem and I can't say the same for a lot of other people in there yeah so I think I finally just gave up I had always wanted to have kids I'd always wanted to have a family I didn't always like the idea of marriage but I did like the idea of being a dad and that basically set me up to be involved with women who had kids so I would have these great relationships with these children these stepkids and I would put up with their completely dysfunctional selfish mother and then she would get jealous of how much I cared about the kids and that the kids preferred me for parenting like they bring their report cards to me I'm the one who teaches them how to tie their shoelaces when I cooked them dinner they eat it because I actually make them the dinner the way they want to eat it not just I'm going to make I'm going to slap together some a shit and I don't give a fuck what it tastes like because I'm not eating it and then I'll just yell at the kids if they don't eat it and when they don't eat it and I'll give them sugar and then I'll get mad at them for running around and being a backstress before bad it's like no I would make a specific meal for each of the kids and one relationship I had three stepkids and one relationship I had two stepkids all under the age of nine all five of them so like that was great I love being a dad but the women are such toxic monsters that you can't really have a healthy relationship in America I think anymore with American women and if you could they're probably already married to someone else so unless you're willing to steal a woman away from another man and if she can be stolen she can be stolen from you or unless you get them so young that they haven't turned evil yet but then at that point all of society looks down on you because you're dating someone less than half your age so I'm pretty much I'm aged out of the equation that at 46 years old there's no one who's single and saying and young enough to be marriage material either they're ready divorced and they hate all men because they think all men are like they're ex husband or they've got three kids or two kids so at best you will be fourth or fifth most important person in life there's them their kids their dog their mother then there's you but you have to pay for all of them fuck that it's just people say oh you're cynical it's like when you're 46 come talk to me about how close minded I am or whether I have an accurate assessment of my life and I'm not seeing this will apply to anyone else but I don't think that unless I become a different human I'm gonna get different results if I was to try again when I tried bumble a few months ago because that's supposed to be the last trash you dating up every single woman was late they were late with no makeup on they didn't do their hair or they were on time with no makeup and their hair wasn't done and they brought their kid with them nobody took it seriously no one showed up on time and prepared and ready and then all of their all of their accounts they're looking for long term relationships so when you start talking about long term relationships and trying to define what type of relationship they're looking for they're uncomfortable as if it's too much too quick it's like this is a fucking wife interview you've done idiot what why would if you're coming to a wife interview and this is supposed to be a husband and wife interview where we're interviewing each other for long term compatibility that is the purpose and then like oh that's too much pressure for a first date is like no you're just too much of a flake that you're 40 something years old you ain't got time to waste you have no money in the bank you're 40 years old you have no job you don't have anything to bring to the table at all you should just show up at least put together and try to make this into a functional interview for us rather than just hey it's a free meal fuck this guy which is I guess the way they approach it so I'm pretty much burnt out on it and I would say that I'm so over it and I so don't care anymore I find it ironic that you bring up roll-o-tomasi he actually started following me and so I message them I was like hey man I'm a big fan and so we've been to come friends after just from because he likes war hammer and metal and lifting and he didn't even know I knew who he was I was like yeah man I've been a fan of yours for a while first of my saw you you interviewed me Kayla Peter Vison and you nailed her to the wall about how she didster husband to go hang out with Andrew Tate and then you brought up shorter Petersen too so it's all full circle yeah like so I was I almost got married in Australia and I you know obviously don't want to say anything bad about my ex-feon say but it was it was my mistake and not being able to select a woman who was you know would have been a good wife and I'd like sold my house and I was I was staying in this hotel room I was getting this tattoo done here which was all done like stick and hoax so it was done but so it took like a hundred hours so I was in this hotel for a month just getting tattooed three times a week just you know devastated that I had just like fucked up a whole bunch of my circumstances and it was right when I think this was like 2020 like right when kind of the world wanted to shit never on the cabinet yet and I watched hours and hours of rollo and you know everyone in that space and as a result of it I basically sat there and went you learn the red flags and you learn the green flags and women and I basically sat there and went there was this girl I dated in Lithuania where they still actually have traditional proper values and they actually you know want to be married and and be wives and have that traditional relationship dynamic and this woman was so sweet and good to me when I was still doing rehab my brain injury when I was a fucking mess I had nothing to offer I had no money and she was so good to me and I was like I'm gonna go back and see if she's around I mean I can't go if I have other reasons but and yeah as soon as I got here and you know we started dating and we got married a year and a half good and um that there was so many processes and qualifiers that I put her through and a big part of it was going to her house and beating a parents and seeing how much a dad loved her mom and seeing how like there's just so much love and loyalty that she was raised by and that's just not in the West anymore like people people in the West love and be like oh if you get married you can just get divorced like we don't have that mentality here it's like yeah if you do something horrific the relationship will end but this is once you get married it's like you can't just move on because all you want to go and live your best life and see what else is out there like it's like over here I mean we get down to like minus 25 degrees cells use some winter it is fucking dark for like seven months of the year like you need each other like this is a poor country this is a harsh country and like people team up here out of necessity and when you have these proper strong bonds like I mean I'm 32 like all our friends are married and it's it's so different but in in the West when I see these relationships I'm like the man is not leading the man is not capable of leading the woman's not capable of following and if she was she wouldn't be following him there's so much like I I see women disrespect their husbands like in public all the time in front of their friends and that there's just there's so much shit that I'm like this is just like why are you doing this like what's the benefit like what do you have to gain and it's you know my goal of here is like we live in you know national park on the lake we've got like a very peaceful spot in nature you know there's a castle down the road like I don't really see anyone or speak to anyone I love that no one in my country really speaks English very well because I don't have to over here people's bullshit like one of the best things about Eastern Europe is you go up it did not and you can't understand the bullshit people are saying each other I come home to Australia and I'm like the self-checkout and you just see some you're woman being a bitch to a husband and people just saying all this horrible shit to each other and I'm like I don't want any of that so it's dating in the West is just it's it's it's it's it's rigged against you like the odds of being all the good women to take in and it's just it's it's it's it's it's like finding a needle in a haystack it's just the odds are so against people so and then they go oh well I'm going to move to Eastern Europe and find a wife and it's like it's like hard mode over here like yeah they're feminine and beautiful and traditional but that means you have to be masculine as fuck you need that polarity of roll it talks about but the the part that these guys have to start with and the the most important thing that I try to teach them is that like you have to develop what roll it talks about which is this frame it's like you have your view of the world you have your perspective in way of understanding and you bring them into that and to do that you actually have to understand the fucking world because if you're leading in your blind just going to fuck it up for both of you and I mean I see why a lot of these women don't want to follow men but also like I wouldn't I don't even I wouldn't want to spend any time with any of them let alone co-habitate with them like if if you're not adding value to each others lives and you know if if women aren't soft and feminine and bringing that spiritual energy to the to the relationship it's like what why are you doing it like what what do you even have to gain you just doing it because you think you're supposed to do it and then the amount of guys I know who are either getting divorced raped or some fucking bullshit court case against them that's completely fabricated like a woman will be like oh you fuck me over I don't like you so I'm gonna go to the cops and say that you beat me and rape to me and then I'm gonna ruin your life statistically and it's like that is pure malevolence that is evil shit and unless you really trust someone I mean I would be got close enough to them to be able to do that I actually counsel man that you never let a woman in your house because once they're in your house you can't remove them from their house forcibly even if they're breaking shit if you have gear in your house she will call the police and say you hit her and you are on steroids and you will go to jail that you either take a girl to a hotel or you go to her house and if she lives with their parents you don't date her but you do not let a woman in your house because you can't get them out if a woman blocks the door I actually had to do this with a woman who was a captain of the US army and I listened to this podcast today that you were talking about that yeah I had an order to get out of her house because she was blocked in the door because we were watching one of her drama shows and this woman's crying because she lost her baby and so I started crying so she started making fun of me and called me the F.A. G. word because I was crying I was like I've lost a baby like that too and then she's like oh like we all have and had blood we all have and had toilets full of blood before get over it and I was like you know what I'm not going to be talking to like this fuck you I'm done and I got up at I started leaving and she ran gotten in front of the door and I was like you are blocking that door preventing me from exiting that is kidnapping if I call the police on you you will have a court martial and you will lose your commission get out of my way right now and she froze and when she opened the door and she let me go and she's like real mature she all the bathroom you know that was it I never saw her again but if you go to their house you can I mean luckily she was a cop enough to know I was right but to think that you have to know the laws of kidnapping and where there's a difference between domestic violence, self defense and kidnapping in order to survive a date is absolutely fucking ludicrous and there's no reason to even be involved with that subspecies with that gender like it's so scary that you hear these beautiful stories about people in eastern Europe women in eastern Europe Asia, South America and now I'm hearing that when guys go to Columbia to meet wives they slip their throats and shit it's like well that country is out that's where the bus women are and they have a sexy voice and they're good cooks like a male order bride or a passport bride from Columbia sounded perfect I was all getting a part mid-down there and everything and then I find out that now that's pretty much murder you and even if they don't murder you they'll cheat on you it's like well then that's out so we're pretty much left with Asia like Chinese or North Korean women desperate to get out of the communist country might be loyal enough because unlike every other man on earth most of us western men are not physically abusive so you like they get a good deal it was it was very funny when I was so because of the whole COVID-19 bullshit basically so if you're Australian and you come to Europe you can stay in the shengen zone for like 90 days out of every 180 days and but because I wasn't vaccinated no one would let me fly back to Australia until they made an exception when you know Ukraine kicked off because we weren't sure what was going to happen over here wouldn't win that whole ball went down so I eventually got to fly it out and I got to the border and they were like you've been here way too long and I was like yeah I know but like they wouldn't let me leave so they wouldn't let me back in and it wasn't the only reason we got married basically to continue our relationship with your married and when we were at like the the courthouse in Lithuania they were your marrying in to Lithuania and Australian is marrying in here it's not the other way around I'm like yeah and they're like we don't we have not ever seen this they're like usually it's women marrying out so yeah it's you know a lot of men over here they go you know Eastern Europe's the place to come and I'm gonna find this sweet traditional wife from a small town and all this kind of stuff and it's like yeah Instagram has ruined that like I've been I've been coming here since 2014 to visit my father and I watched Eastern Europe become traditionally West light it's not traditionally gradually westernised over time because of social media and you could really really see it happen and you know now you have to be just as wary of here because there's a lot of opportunistic women who have poor intentions and you know I know men in my immediate family who you know they they married the wrong woman from you know this part of the world of Russia and the day after everything like illegal he became there like half their shit in Australia which I think is like you have to marriage for a year or two years the day after they just slap them with divorce babies and they go you know I'm taking half your shit and it's scary when you see it happen because these guys who get brought up like what roller says on the you know sugar splice everything's nice and you know the Disney kind of fairy tale and when they get that rug ripped out from under them like it just completely destroys the whole fucking life because these guys love these women unconditionally that care bonded with them and then because the woman's broken she hasn't pear bonded back and when I could that that can be disturbing like when you look that in the eye and you see evil in the eye and someone that you've loved like that's that can fuck you up and so I'm at that point where I'm I expected that this is I've had but I'm so much more cunning than they are that even if I'm not dishonest I still can think dishonestly so I never engage in things that will have permanent consequences I always know the ankles I always know the laws like I would never marry anyone without a pre-nup that nothing absolutely nothing is going to be hers when she comes into this relationship with nothing she if she leaves she will have nothing and that'll be that and they'll or there'll be no marriage we'll go to the Renaissance festival and have the King and Queen night us and we'll have a well exchange rings but there will be no law involved the United States government will not have to say in the goddamn thing I do certainly not my relationship and if someone doesn't like it to fucking bad yeah marriage contracts are scary and like a lot of people who don't realize what they've signed until off to their sign it like I mean you're not making a contract with each other you're making a contract with the government and um you know unless there is a reason that you have to do that like let's say you do you have to get a joint loan or you have to get it like unless there's an act like a really really good reason like it's it's most of the time it is the you know it's a risk to real what a lot of things just like with TRT and medicine there's a risk to reward ratio and the risk is massively out because the whip like I think I think I'm quoting roll it again but like the woman you divorce is not the woman you marry and that's when you really find out who they are and it it's scary it's confronting it's disturbing and you know when the sad thing is when like you know yourself you've worked out patent recognition you've worked out odds you know you kind of been around the block and you kind of gone okay like you know this patent yeah but when guys get out of one of those and they just go straight into the next one I mean that at that stage I'm like this is just an IQ deficiency at this stage I mean or or their romantic see believe it or not no one would guess that I'm a cancer right it's just that the FBI has determined that the astrological side most likely to become a serial killer is a cancer and that's when you're super sensitive when you snap you break bad so it's like I don't know if I'm capable of having any real relationship at this point I think I've had so many bad relationships I am now damaged and whether I have therapy or not I don't think it's going to change my suspicion and my low expectations of what an American born Western woman specifically white women will do in a relationship and that's it's sad because I I've went into so many relationships open minded like this one's going to be different and they never were and I said and they even will say at the end of the relationship they go you told me exactly what was going to happen you said exactly what I was going to do and I told you I wouldn't you even told me that we'd have this conversation right now I did every single thing you told me I was going to do and I didn't believe you and you were 100% about right about all of it and I've had that conversation like six or seven times and it's like and so at this point it's like maybe it's not only women maybe it's me but I am mean I'm not going to stop being me there's no way for me to have a sole transfer I'm not going to be able to use necromancy and swap my spotty out and whatever body my sole is it's still going to generate this relationship so if I'm too much in the masculine and all of their male relationships the guys like 60% masculine 40% feminine at best and they're used to being 40% max you're in 60% feminine and I'm going into it like 90% masculine and I'm like look you don't need to work you don't need to cook or get a maid you don't need to clean I'll get a maid I'll do all the cooking you you can do cardio and you can workout you can compete everything will be paid for you just no hitting no verbal abuse no lies and they're like that's it as like that's it no abuse of any sort and no lies and none of them can make it three fucking weeks they can't tell the truth for three fucking weeks so then they're out and then they're like I what just happened I was like I caught you like that was one of the three rules and this none of them can do it they all think it's just you have two low standards I'm like oh I do let's see you meet my extremely low standards and they can yeah yeah I think like when you're in early relationships you have these like you know these rose tinted glasses where you just like you know there's I caught me before I'm quoting you but there's there's there's there's more flags than like there's more red flags and like a Chinese communist party parade and you're just looking right past them with these rose tinted glasses on and then on side you look back and you were like oh this was actually the 20th thing that I should have drawn the line up because if I look back at all the past relationships I had the straw the broke the camel's back was not the first thing it was just that I looked past it because and it's it's just a lot of the time since I went on coaching guys as well and this is something that I found that's really true is that like because I'm very empathetic and I love people for who they could be and you know what I see the good in people and then I give them the benefit of the doubt I'm like oh you know you didn't mean that you were you know coming from this place of whatever and you you forgive them when they haven't earned forgiveness and the problem is that people are not who they could be people are not the good that they have in them they're who they are when they're at that point and they how they show up and how they show up is the thing that's going to cause damage to you and can potentially be vindicted and harmful and malicious and all of these things and it's this romantic I mean many of the romantic so I don't think women are romantic so I think I think nano romantic and when we come in with this you know romantic idea from what we've been brought up on with like TV and Disney movies and stuff and you come in and you you know you see the good in them and you see that you know this this amazing person that's just got a bit of baggage and a bit of trauma and they're acting out a little bit and this and that and this and that know that they're who they are when they're showing up and if they haven't done that work and then damage then it's going to end up badly whether you whether you love them or not and that can be a really difficult thing to walk away from but it'll be more difficult down the track if you really get this big padb on you find actually invest you go habitat you have all these things I mean that's the stuff that just ruins people's lives if they show up late without their makeup on and you catch them lying four times in the first 20 minutes and you give them and you think that you can change them that would be like you have a rotted apple and you think that if you eat it slow enough it'll go back in time and stop being rotted like fruit doesn't re-ripe and once your woman spoiled brat she's not getting unspoiled milk doesn't unspoil. I can get plastic surgery to fix their face but they anybody who was pretty when they were young are usually evil and then as they get older they're just now evil and unless attractive so they've they've they've expired but they no longer have what they needed to have if there was a person who had some type of internal values like they had enough respect for you to think hey she's on prep he needs to eat at 7 p.m but he's already pushed the date back to 8 because he's being accommodating the my schedule he has a very specific diet that he's going to bend the rules and eat it a restaurant even though he only cooks his own food and then you're going to show up at 8.50 soon now an hour and 50 minutes late and then you're not even ready then you're a piece of shit and if men actually had those standards from the very first date they would never have problems in life because and then I always say to myself would you put up with this shit from a man? An answer's never yes women get men put up with shit from women they would never put up with from a man so if you if women want to be treated with the same respect men get and they need to act as respectable as a man you need to show up early prepared with manners and respect and you have to show empathy and the other person and they can't just be like oh you don't have emotional intelligence because you don't understand everything I'm feeling and thinking it's like you haven't shown any inkling at all that you have any empathy towards me whatsoever or respect why on earth would I give a fuck about your feelings if you don't care about mine? Yeah it's the the big thing that I when I was you're at the time deciding you know to get married because this was a big decision for me the biggest overage and principle for me was is this a good person because at you know at the time like I was 30, 31 and she was 29, 2 years younger than me I was like this this you know we're still you know figuring life out was still developing as people but is this a good person is this and my big qualifier was like is this someone who I don't mean you know it's never gonna happen just in your case someone's watching this back try to pin some of me but is this the person who would help me hide a body like is that that's the kind of loyalty that I'm looking for and if someone's got phenomenal morals and values and you know we're still both working on ourselves and we're still you know fought in some ways but that that respect is the most important thing when I was with my ex-fiance and things were super rocky and and all this kind of stuff the conversation that ends at the engagement was me saying it feels like you don't respect me and she said I don't respect you when I said give me my ringback I'm out and that was like super because you invested so much like I moved across the country, I had sold my house but I mean at that point if I'd continue that relationship I couldn't respect myself and then I had to look at two aspects of this being like why did I select a woman and commit to marry someone essentially who didn't respect me and two why am I not worthy of respect I mean I have some role to play in this like there's something here that isn't you know why she's taken advantage of me I mean like I've you know selected to do this so it's it's it's a it's a it's a big thing but respect is the most important thing and you know now in in my relationship I'm very happily married I love being married to my wife and it's because I am on a mission I'm on a quest to do all this stuff and she loves supporting me on my mission like that's that's her role in terms of making my life easier and better and supporting me so that I can apply myself more like I couldn't do any degree of the amount of work and cognitive output I do because basically like I train I do my cardio mobility and then I basically empty my brain every day to the point that I'm basically retarded by the end of the day and I can barely speak and she basically facilitates an environment for me to do that because she loves what I'm doing and she sees the purpose and the benefit and all the stuff that I'm doing and she loves it and believes and it and enjoys supporting me doing that and I'm like that's the only situation that a relationship works because otherwise it's just your competing against each other there's resentment there's it's just kind of like your roommates that are fucking and it's just it doesn't work unless you've got that one shared goal and trajectory that you're leading and that dynamic has just people have been deconditioned from that dynamic due to just Western societal bullshit but it's very rare to be able to I mean guys need to get to the point that they're actually capable of doing that and then finding someone who also believes and that and has that same value and still it in them is very very very very rare. So if I look at a business like a machine that I am the engine and the other people in my business whether they be employees partners don't work I find but employees work profit sharing with employees but no controlling interests that then the machine runs and then when you get into relationship it's like taking sand and throwing it in the gears it just fucks the whole machine up because the girl tries to get between you and your employees tries to poison your mind against your employees wants to eliminate employees just because they're bored and they want drama. Now if you could find I don't even need a woman to support me I'm 100% independent I do everything myself I would like to have a maid so if I had a girlfriend who actually cleaned and did laundry that would be way more useful to me than someone who did absolutely fucking nothing but did drugs and drank all day but that's all I've ever known is women that just drink and do drugs and do nothing so if I act and then if they do have a job it's some like it's a fraction it's like 10% of what I make or less so it's inconvenient that their job gets in the way of me doing what I need to do because they're a whole day of work I'm making an hour so like there's no point in them working at all at that point so I would just I'm like I'm gonna hire you to not do that I'm gonna pay you whatever you make it work just to not work there that's your allowance to not go there because that's getting in my way and then that reads resentment that they actually feel like they have no self-actualization, no self-esteem but they don't look at the big picture is that your job is a liability and it's in the way of the big picture and none of them seem to understand that the more money I make the higher their standard of living gaps that if I was to get increased an income by 10% that would double the amount of disposable income that they would have because none of them look at a guy based off of his net income or disposable income they look at men based on gross income irregardless of liabilities so they see a dude with a Lamborghini in a huge house and they think he's rich but the guy is basically maybe got five grand disposable income whereas if you see someone who's got a Tesla and an apartment he might have 50,000 disposable income a month so it's like that none of them think like that so I don't I can't think like they do so I tried to make teach them how to think and show them the world through my eyes so that they can understand the big picture and be like you don't even have to be part of the machine just don't throw fucking sand in the machine yeah that's that's exactly it so what I when I moved here to the thorania my wife was working at a company called Bolt which is like a European version of the blue book like a restaurant thing and she was like a customer service kind of lead saying and you're over here we don't have like sexual harassment laws we don't have overtime laws like people get paid the equivalent of like 600 to maybe a thousand US dollars a month for working like like brutally like it's horrific so one day I set it down and I'm like what do you make can she tell me I'm like I'm like okay if I work in extra hour a day five days a week I can make that for you so I'm like quit your job and work for me and she's like what what would I do if you I'm like oh work someone out so you know at the start I'm like I'm sitting here being like I don't know what she can do I'm like just like work out my emails and reply to emails and just like help me with stuff because maybe I'm autistic or ADHD or some kind of diagnostics to ship it I can sit online and answer very advanced you know biomedical science questions easily but like doing my washing and cooking and cleaning is like the hardest shit ever because I fucking hated so I was like just assist me for a couple of hours a day with stuff and then you'll be able to I'll match a wage and we can do that and if it wasn't for that I wouldn't have been able to scale my business to what it is and bring her along to basically ultimately you know because our relationship solid and I really believe in it I'm like it because you supported me and invested in me I'm like my gift to you is giving you the life that I'd love to live which is to be provided for or to be taken care of and like that works because it's like it's like it's the the the woman the the wife is complimentary to every aspect of my business it allows me to be way more productive way more happy way it more peace because I can focus a hundred percent on the thing that allows us to live the life that we have because I don't get distracted by just like a life that admin shit which I just I hate doing and that like that I think is like what what one of the benefits of of being I mean obviously if you're a relationship with someone who like doesn't speak English then you can't communicate but when the the partners English is their second language I mean my life speaks fantastic English but it's not a first of those language you tend to communicate love more with actions because that's how you communicate and that's how we you know communicate it you know love and loyalty for so many years before we had a common language and then you can have this dynamic that actually works because you're both complimenting each other's lives it's like yes I'm doing a lot more financially but this stuff in terms of the responsibility and all this shit that you're doing is like that propels this like 10x it's like it's like multiply and I just think that's the only dynamic that works and I just don't think I just don't see other dynamics working and then people will say oh well you know my relationship does and again just like you've said and I've said a million times exceptions always exist they just don't disprove rules and you know yes it sure does work sometimes but most of the time that's what makes a relationship happy because you're both solving problems for each other that you can't solve yourself and that otherwise there's no need for the relationship like it's just if you're otherwise just business partner like you said like when I used to one of my jobs at university was like I managed like a local like music venue and when I it was an all ages venue it was a skate park and when I started writing the program like no one came to the shows it was like it was shit and we ended up selling up the shows every weekend with just local bands coming and playing their first show was really cool and the bands used to get paid like a hundred bucks to play the show and I was like well this doesn't make any sense I'm like I'm going to give a profit split so headline it gets three bucks ahead and support act gets two bucks ahead open and get one dollar ahead and then that way everyone has a stake in the game to promote the show and do a good job and come back and then you know that's where everyone wins and I can't lose because I can't be out because it's on a guarantee and then we can all win because everyone's got investment in it but I'm in charge and that that's how things have to work is that people have to have a stake in the game but the has to have to be respect in the has to be loyalty and most people just don't have that it's like free will like everyone's capable of developing free will but most people are at the level that they can exert it because they're just to leave in the wind to their flows so I think like if you had a wife that had a useful job like a lawyer then you can hire your wife to be your lawyer like I have a corporate lawyer for my four businesses and I pay him a livable wage so if I was married to a woman she could be my lawyer you know same thing with I have a social media manager yeah it would be useful I could employ or if my wife understood and was smart enough to understand what I do and then and a lot of these girls I want to date with they simply couldn't even understand the core concept of what I do they just like so what hospital you work at like I don't work in a hospital but I thought you're a doctor I'm like I know I don't need to work for someone else I work for myself they're like what do you mean a hospital is a business and a doctor who works at a hospital is an employee of that hospital because he's not good enough to make a living owning his own practice I own my own practice I don't work at a hospital and they couldn't get it and I'm like all right well this person's her IQ is too low to understand the building there's no way she can figure out how to get into the building or how to navigate inside of the building or how to remodel the building to make the building run more efficiently so she's not invited back to look at the building it's the same thing it's like if I had if I met someone who is smart enough to understand core concepts like use enough to ask her to get the estrogen where it needs to be to get the IGF one to be where it needs to be then one steps achieved introduce master on instead to drive anabolic if necessary if they could understand that core concept which a lot of men aren't smart enough to understand no matter how many times they watch a video she could do customer service you know or like the blood work I have a huge bottleneck in service where someone orders a blood work review but they're not smart enough to order their blood work and then when the blood work comes they're not smart enough to put it on the spreadsheet for me to read the blood work so if I had a customer service person to facilitate those people and get them ready to wear when I have the conversation with them I have the materials to review the blood work instead I have to have a phone call with them to tell them step one then I have to have a phone call with them to have them do step two then I have to have a phone call with them to have them do step three and at this point it's like this should be four different consoles this isn't one blood work review this is three consoles leading up to a blood work review and so yeah if she was smart enough to facilitate that she would be useful as an employee but and so it wouldn't just be throwing money away supporting this human that has no skillset but whether they're a waitress or receptionist and they're making maybe 20,000 30,000 a year that's not worth my time to have to drive them to work and pick them up because they can't afford a car that's a complete waste of my life like I I will buy you a car and I and you will have this task do this task and that will save me time because the amount of time that takes me to drive you to work and pick you up from work cost me more opportunity cost than you made in that eight-hour shift and they don't get that they think you're an oppressive man trying to control them yeah and that's just absurd because it's it's leadership and it's that it's the ultimate gift is to provide this like if we look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs and anyone who's listening who's not familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs like it's the most important thing you can understand from like just how life works whether it's business or psychology and the thing that I found when I was growing up just in terms of like female friends I had all girls I dated is that stress just destroyed feminine energy and stress women would just like just not fun to be around because they weren't as good at regulating their emotions so when they were stressed they just become hard and they they wouldn't have that soft loving nurturing maternal feminine energy that's just like really just you know when you're pouring your heart out to the world and you're on a hero's journey and you're trying like you're doing everything you can like that's the one thing that money can't buy it's just like that softness and when they're stressed that goes away and the bottom of the Maslow's pyramid is like food water shelter so if a woman is financially stressed her feminine energy is just completely gone and that you know if if a woman is you know making minimum wage and working a rars off and can barely pay a bills and has got all this stuff going on and she doesn't have the discernment or the critical thinking to kind of realize that that you know if she does the right thing and find a situation where she can be of use to someone and basically you know not partner in a business in terms like a business partnership but propels something and use those skills to you know really create something amazing it's it's just it just doesn't work and I understand why it doesn't work because you know there's a really good study and it was I'm probably going to butcher it a little bit but they took two groups of farmers and they paid one group a year wage up front and then the other group got paid monthly and then they tested their IQ at the start of the year after they got paid and the end of the year when they didn't have any money left and they found that when people had a bunch of money that IQ points were 15 points higher because when they were financially stressed they were more like a mid to the driven and they were in that fight of flight mood and they were thinking rational and that's the big thing and I see with guys as well like when when guy it doesn't matter how much money a guy is making he has to manage his finances properly so that he feels like he's not you know checking his bank balance to pay the next bill like you know you can have systems of people having read it check out the barefoot investor it's got pictures in it you can look at the pictures not even read the book and work it out but when when someone is financially stressed their lower IQ of their more emotionally reactive and they don't make proper decisions and you know someone's going to clip this and make me sound like an asshole but like dumb women are very endearing because they're sweet and it's like oh it's cute that you know they're a bit ditty but a dumb women will also have a conflict in a relationship instead of resolving it will go jump on another dick like that's that's where that dumbness can become a real fucking problem and yeah people need to read the rational man because it's like you have to see it for what it is and then you have to work out what you want whether you want to be a womanizer you want to do the black pill thing or you want to get married in fact like you you can take whatever road you want to from that but you have to know what you're dealing with because the biggest mistakes that people make in life is getting involved with the wrong what's the black pill? Black pill is this like term that they happen that space where you just like completely just check out of all women all relationships and you just oh they go like I know the term like not a big town yeah men who go their own way where you no longer feels obligated by society to be partnered with any woman you can get your hands on no matter how hideous they are you're just like you know what there is no woman I can get that is above my minimum qualifications for being with me then I might be a two I guess in the eyes of women but my standards for women is a 4.9 if I can't pull a 4.9 I'll be alone yeah yeah and I think that you know if people want to do that voluntarily that's great but it's when people are in voluntarily McDow in terms of that just it's just a cope I think that can be a real problem but you know people I think it's always everybody is everyone who's McDow is basically an insult it's just that they might have a high standard in the cell yeah like I won't date someone who I don't want to have sex with if the thought of dating them what makes me grossed out then I don't want to date them that means technically I'm an insult but it also means that I might have really high standards got girls that I think are four other guys might think are in eight because when I was much younger I would get really good looking girls and now I would not get girls as good looking as what I used to get 10 years ago so my standards are still that high but I'm not at that league anymore so it's just like do I want to play in a lower league or do I just want to not play do I want to retire and so I feel like I just retired you know and when when people tell me that I'm like I in the same circumstance but do the exact same thing like it's because you know you mentioned before it's like maybe a dimension it's like well maybe you've been hardened by life and just learned your lesson like I mean it's it's you know this different perspective I'm definitely cynical but I know I'm right and I know that all the guys who are saying to me like oh my wife's different well she's special she's not like other girls I used to think like you then I met her and then two years later he's divorced and it's just like okay you know I'm sad about it I wish that he was wrong I wish he was right I was wrong but I'm just like we'll see man now the exception is people who are in your boat where they met non-western women where they met a woman from eastern Europe or Asia those women are actually loyal wives so that's the exception and I also think and it's it's it's difficult you know with the age thing as well but it really really helps if you're the first man that she's loved like I think like that's the it's a beer bag and yeah and you know Rollo showed it in the studies in terms of you know if you look at like the amount like the boy as the body count goes higher the initiation of divorce from the woman side goes up as well and I just I don't think women can properly pair bond that many times and I would argue that I think that most of them again exceptions sure but the the first pair bonding is the biggest one and that's like I think that that's really important and yeah that's you know when I was deciding to date this woman who I wanted to be my wife I was like the big thing I learned from the red pill is that you know I pergamy and you know women love opportunities to clean all that kind of stuff and you know I was like well this woman really loved me when I was you know I could barely walk so I'm like well that's probably a good criteria to start dating otherwise I wouldn't have bothered and when she when she first started being my assistant I was sitting there because I wanted to help me with in-voicing because I hate I hate it at the time I was able to pay about like fucking hate dealing with pay about straps way better and I was like well if I give her access to my bank accounts now it can be like a litmus test for issues and a steal from me and then if she steals from you now that'll be cheaper than if we have to get the horse so I'm like this will be a good shit test and I've told her that a bunch of times I mean she'll listen to this and have a lot but um like I've told her that in hindsight and she was like that was probably a good strategy and yeah it's uh it's it's tricky it's it's very tricky yeah like there is a girl who is so nice and so easy going and so attractive compared to how awful all the other ones were that I connected with that she was going to come over I was going to make her dinner most girls now at 10 years ago girls would come over you make her dinner would be totally normal for a state now they're all of they won't even let you send an Uber to their house to pick them up you have to send an Uber to a neighbor's house for them to go to it to get picked up it's there's so paranoid about and it's like well that's because if you're dangerous now no it's less dangerous now there's less danger it's just women are more difficult anyway so this one was so nice she was going to drive over and she I was like this girl's going to fucking murder me she's going to try to kill me and take jewelry out of my safe or some shit because this is going way too easy and then I was like okay well we'll give it a shot we'll see I hit a couple guns in the living room so if she tried some shit I had guns ready and she asked me for gas money I'm like sure I'm like how much you want she's like 40 bucks so I sent her 50 bucks and then she goes to be immediately blocked me and it blocked me on the bumble lap and everything and I'm just like laughing and stuff so I told some people because I thought it was funny and of course some stupid mother fuckers like you should never give women money what's wrong with you I'm like listen here you sink to Monius asshole I didn't give her money as a gift I thought she was so poor because she was from honey actually needed gas money and the money I spent on gas is one tenth what it would cost to take her to dinner that some of these girls if I go at the eat I have to eat sushi which means I have to eat sashimi because is zero carb so she'll order one fucking roll but I have to order a $300 dinner for myself so by me spending $40 and finding out she's a thief that's a lot cheaper than me taking her to a restaurant and spending $300 and then not getting a second date so yeah and I want to be like that's why your poor piece of shit is because you're shortsighted but boy did that piss me off to have this guy give me shit about it who he was an employee he's fired now but he wasn't an employee criticizing my judgment with money when it was like it was a I was testing this woman is she is this all it's gonna be is this you're gonna rip me off for 40 bucks that's so cheap for $40 I find out this woman's a piece of shit whereas if I took her to dinner it'd be at least $100 if not $300 and then especially with someone you know like like a selfie with such a and like one thing that you know I was I was so blessed to be mentored when I was doing my marketing degree by someone who was you know excelling in business and I think he he was like if I asked you to come and like break my garden on a Sunday in your spare time what would you charge me you know I'm like well you know my hourly rate is there's probably 20% more than that because it's my spare time and you go say okay good you go your spare time is worth that is you know worth you basically what you charge plus whatever percent you value your spare time at and he goes anything that you're spending your time on that's a waste of time you're losing that much money is opportunity cost and like you know not only did you save that money but you also like saved the the hours of your time but also like you know one thing I explained to my clients is like I think we wake up every day with a hundred bucks to give and you know that's why like I have someone who managed my social media I have someone who manages like my email address like I have like all these walls set up because like if and you know I had some funny exchanges on the videos that we posted a few on the TRT and home and optimization channel because I was just like I'm just gonna let these morons up because I'm bored but most of the time like I just shield my my my mental energy because I'm like I can't be wasting all the flux I have to give on these idiots because you know no one has ever had a respectful, successful intelligent person like the belligerent YouTube comments like that's just not what good smart people do like we have better I don't think I've ever left a negative comment on a video the only time I'll leave a comment is if I want to be supportive so um and because normal mentally healthy people if they see something that aren't like they just watch something else you press the X button um so it's that opportunity cost and not just your time but also just like you mental energy like when you do stuff like what you and I do like I don't know about you but at the end of my day like you know because I basically do a lot of my clam work in like an asynchronous fashion like I review and provide feedback and then it goes to the doctors and I work very efficiently but like I drain the absolute hell out of my brain I don't have that many flux to give it the end of the day and I just couldn't be wasting my mental energy on shit bags because I'd rather use that time to be productive with my business or help people with stuff that they really need help and that's the thing. What I found was that ignorant comments or verbally abusive comments should be handled differently but either way they put me in a bad mood so that when I do talk to someone on the phone that could be a potential patient if I'm not in a good mood I may not they may not hire me so I'm not going to set myself up to get stressed out. For example that's actually a kind of a bad example um I just yeah I call it a emotional energy that I'm an introvert and I have to spend emotional energy to engage with people with the exception if it's a deep conversation with one person that's intelligent. I can actually get emotional energy again recharge my emotional battery from talking to you but if I have to talk to multiple people in a casual way like the best examples of party where you basically go around and you small talk people that is draining as fuck for me. I would just sit in a corner and eat my chicken rice and then people would walk up to you and ask you like what you eat and it's like they can literally see that it's chicken rice and like chicken rice and they're like oh yeah I could see that and why do you ask okay so I'll just make you small talk it's like why would you make small talk what's the benefit and I don't understand it it's just the most alien concept to me so I hate people that make small talk because I feel like they're psychic vampires they walk up to you and they suck energy out of you right and and so with the same thing with the comment section so many of the comments section just irritates the fuck out of me because it's the most ignorant bullshit ever and they're new people like all they just found you they've never heard of daily injections they've never heard of master on being in the offseason they've never heard of using long acting drugs it's like the status quo on everything is wrong so I can't and then I have no credibility with this person to win an argument so I just ignore and shit like that and then ever since I just ignored comments I my life is so much better I used to try to engage everyone but it just made me mean and it's counterproductive it pushed people away it doesn't pull them in yeah I think I heard you said out of podcasts you're an IFJ is I yeah INFJ is well I'm DJ I can't understand yeah yeah INTJ is that's introvert and it's the rest of it intuitive thinking and judgmental yeah whereas the the F is when people are feelings yeah yeah I'm not that one yeah yeah and part of the you know when I grew up like I I always kind of felt like there was something wrong with me being introverted when everyone around me was extra and then I you know when you kind of do those person at now any type of test and you meet other people and you kind of you get to the point as well like when you coach people that you realize that everyone's flawed in their own way like everyone's fucking floor and that's fine if you can learn to play your strengths and it's when when I'm super introverted one of the things that I've realized before I did this I was teaching secular based mindfulness meditation to teachers and parents so that they could teach their children emotional regulation so we were you know referencing studies it was completely non-religious and it was really cool and one of the things that we observe and I think everyone knows is that if you read comments on YouTube you can have all the best skills of mindfulness in the world you can know that they're just dickheads who are just you're sad and miserable and projecting but we haven't had our brains you've all fast enough yet to actually be able to separate it to not be real and when you react and respond to these people you end up taking on that energy and response and you know I notice like my blood pressure goes through the roof I get pissed off I embody it I have to calm myself down and I'm like why am I even doing this so yeah I the way that I sorted it out is I just deleted all the social media apps off my phone only my friends and family have my WhatsApp and then I just if I need to go and Instagram or Facebook groups I do it on the computer so I can walk away from it's that works very well but yeah I've had so many podcasts go up on like other channels and a government bunch of users and I'm like I'm not gonna open the comment section at all because if I open it and someone's being a prick and they're wrong like I just I can't go down that rabbit hole because it's gonna ruin my day and I don't gain anything like there's nothing to gain because you can't argue with stupid that's the most important thing I've learned is that stupid people will never be able to realize that they're wrong because that's you or FJ's because FJ's are very strong opinions grounded in their feelings yeah you can't rationalize you can't educate you can't convince those people because they've made up their mind based on bullshit so FJ people are completely worthless that I don't pee a pee people are annoying because they're wishy-washy and agreeable I mean I'd rather someone who is a TJ's exclusively because they think and they make decisions on their thoughts and I've tried to work with FPs I had hired two FPs at the same time one was an FP handyman and one was an FP researcher and they were complete fucking nightmares to deal with one of them was an hour late the first day an hour late the second day seven hours late the third day and didn't show up at all the fourth day that was the handyman so like nothing got done and then the FP researcher needed a couple hours a day worth of direct emotional communication to feel special and it was the most creepy weird interactions I've ever had in my life and then he started complaining to other employees about me being a jerk because I wasn't paying enough attention to and I'd really bad stuff I was I'm downplaying it and I was like yeah this guy's got to go why on earth would you complain to the other employees about me not paying enough attention to you when they're just gonna tell me what you're saying yeah in writing it's like I learned the hard way in life that like feeling stoned matter like no one cares about how you feel because everyone cares about what they feel no one cares yeah and the the part that you get to with that is that you know at first people who are very caught in their feelings they might get sad about it but you just have to get to the point where you just go well that's just what it is and then then it's just fine it's just okay that's reality and the the feeling stuff is very difficult but one of the value I mean I thought I didn't have a filter and then I found you all videos and I was like oh I'm very tanky about you but the value is that when clients come to us for consultations because the consumer journey is now so long with social media people will watch hours of your content for months before they contact you for a consultation so I used to ask people because you know when I was trained and and mentor advice and counsel is in terms of communication I used to ask people I say do you want me to sugarcoat this or do you want me to give it to you straight and then everyone always said give it to me straight because that's why they were coming to me because that's what they wanted so it's it's very refreshing when and I often tell people you know if you if you if you feel uncomfortable or like there's a reason I don't wear a suit in my videos because it would be an authentic because it's just not me and if you can authentically put out exactly who you are and how you communicate and people come to you based on that then you can have recharge and conversations people like my consultations are booked for 45 minutes it typically go for an hour 15 to an hour and a half because I get apped up talking to people and solving their problems and you know analyzing them like an interconnected series of systems and teaching them and you know basically critically solving problems but you put me in a room where I have to make small talk with people that I don't know about bullshit and like I'm often signaling to my wife being like I need to leave I need to leave I need to leave I need to leave I'm going crazy I just want to go home and hang out with my dog and it's one of the best things about living in a country where English is a second language is that I'll get to an event and people will be like oh I'm sorry we're being rude and we're not you know speaking English to include you in the conversation and I'm like it's fine trust me it's fine I'm playing a game on my phone it's totally chill and then it's socially acceptable for me just to not be a part of the conversation and then they don't feel bad I don't feel bad and it's wonderful I'm like this is so peaceful and it's fantastic and then when I do have a conversation with someone like if we're not talking about like you know higher level stuff in terms of like you know humid dynamics or relationship so you know stuff that actually means something it's just like someone is basically plugging in a power outlet into my energy and charging themselves off me and then I used to hang out with people who just they'd be down in the dumps and tie it all week and then they'd have that social interaction on the weekend and they'd have to lie at the mob and I'm like I just got back from Italy and just being in close proximity spaces to other people on the plane and in the streets just draining to me like I just had to go home and just go into my room put the air conditioner on crank Netflix and just be in the dark room and I used to think there was something wrong with that but then I was like no that's totally fine like that's there's nothing wrong with that that's if you're comfortable with who you are and it's working for you fuck being like everyone else like if being like everyone else is the goal I don't want to play that game you can't fit in and be exceptional yeah so I've never felt like I wanted to be like other people I've always looked down on people that were different in that respect I've always felt that my way was the right way and everyone else way is the wrong way and it's like and people are like oh that's so arrogant it's like okay and then I laugh to myself because I look at where they are in life and I look where I am in life it's like yep I'm the one doing it wrong it is like you got it all figured out buddy but I'm enjoying this conversation but I've got to get my next meal in so I'm never how do people get a hold of you? Yeah so I am at advanced fundimensionalhealth.com I have three extremely affordable $29 ebook so that put all my IP and information in if anyone is listening to this and listen through the whole podcast and made it to this point if you want the books and you can't afford them email me I'll send you them free I'd rather people have them um I also have an Instagram I'm David Lee and I have a bunch of videos on YouTube either on the TRT and Home and Optimization Channel or on my own channel I try to put as much information up that people can actually understand I don't use big words to sound smart I try to teach people and if people want to get access to me outside of doing a consultation I've got a long wait list and you know it's it can take a while I have a group called the TRT Academy on school it's $19 a month and I do two video Q&A is a week so you can ask questions and advance in the video gets uploaded you can answer in fact and the reason why I make it put it behind a paywall is that I put a micro transaction there because I know that if there's a small exchange then people actually value my time so it's um I try to make as much content accessible or free to people as possible and that if people want to build a consultation with me they can if you're in Australia we can treat you for TRT with primal zone if you ask us for shit that you don't need we will not sell it to you it will get declined and if you're in eastern Europe we have a clinic over here as well and we're soon going to be servicing Scandinavia so we're trying to make TRT available in countries that have strict borders and so that people can do it that way if that's what they need to do. Awesome great to hear that all right you guys I've heard that a Scandinavia they definitely see steroids is criminal yes so the way that we have to do it even if you so even if you have a prescription in Europe and you send it across to Scandinavia it will still get seas and you'll get called into the police so what we did is we built a pharmacy because one about owners lived in Norway for a while and he's really passionate about it so we sorted it out so that we send it to your pharmacy in Scandinavia which is legal and then you can buy it and pick it up from the pharmacy. So we're trying to sort out a system where we can do free career shipping to Scandinavia as well so and also we're in Europe but our biggest goal is helping people out in Scandinavia because you can't order shit and a lot of people needed so we're solving that problem and we want to get it sold in the next couple of months. All right that's fantastic thank you so much for taking care of people all across the world man well thanks for coming on the show I know we did intend for this to be a masculinity episode but I mean it can't hurt since that's why most of these people are really using this toaster them they don't really just want to be a drug addict they want to be more masculine that's I a hundred percent agree and I think that people think that injecting test or serum will change their mental dispositions it changes the foundations so that when you apply this knowledge it actually sticks but it won't rewire your consciousness like you have to do that yourself and learning proactively like pre-hub is cheaper than rehab so like you know finding out this stuff and being strategic before something goes wrong is a good way to do it but masculinity comes from changing your behaviors and then being an outcome of the person who did that you know thank you so much for having me as I said before I have watched so much with your content that my wife has waited out about it so it's awesome to be able to be here and have a chat all right cool well I'll talk to you later today thanks for coming on the show man thanks so much
