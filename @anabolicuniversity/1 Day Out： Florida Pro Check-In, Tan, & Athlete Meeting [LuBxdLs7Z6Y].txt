You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. We're driving to meet Dominus Airbnb so I can post for him in person and he can make some adjustments to the diet if needed. I woke up at 173.5 this morning. After one meal I was 175. I didn't look better today than it had yesterday. I don't know what his opinion is yet. We'll see in a few seconds minutes and foods greater today, salt's greater water's less and we'll see how it goes. I'd suck pretty good for about four hours and I couldn't sleep for two more and then I took a bunch of shit to make me sleep and I slept a few more hours and I woke up very well rusted. I have a different strategy going into tonight's sleep that'll be much more aggressive so I don't have to double down on stuff that can bleed over the next day. That's the sort of thing that they didn't just have people park their own cars. They had to be in control of parking them but then they got locked in. That's so goddamn dumb. I'm so glad I'm always early because everyone else is so fucking dumb. We're waiting to we don't know where to park our cars so I thought valet would make sense but the valet situations of fucking cluster. And this guy with this little army vehicle thinks he's hot shit and he's breaking with the pattern and then this one. See I'm in line here because he told me to get in line and then all these fucking people are taking cuts in line. Hey I was here before that guy. All right. Now it's not your fault for being an asshole because he knew I was in front of him because I almost hit him with my car so he could back the fuck up. I kind of surprised by how assertive I am in public. No one would ever accuse me of being what's intimate. A keyboard warrior that I'm passive in person and only confrontation only in and out quite the contrary. I've seen you conduct traffic at the airport. Oh it's a woman that's why she drives like that who took a bunch of steroids. She's hyper aggressive but still not a good driver. I would go over well. With what? My female clients I don't have. Yes here you're five female fans. Well I've got one female fan on YouTube. One hurt checkins at five though so that actually makes sense. He's going that's good. Okay cool. She got my keys. Cool. All right sweet. Hey I'm sorry about that. You're checking in at five o'clock right? So you're trying to get up there. Yeah I totally you totally shouldn't have went in front of me. Yeah I'm glad you went in the front of me because you have to get up there. I don't have to check until six. No it was very disorganized and it's only that dude who's doing that. Yeah it's on very big. Who would put it in between seven buildings or whatever. It's me on me go hotel and the other side of the theater that has the worst real estate so that it'd be cheaper. What do you smile on it? Because I didn't know what gender I was talking to. You're a man. You're a man. I don't know how to sell. Yeah. Because I had no idea what was going on over there. Six o'clock. No I know that. I just couldn't tell. No in the air you get into a space will be right with you. You already know the drill. Team here's 180 for the 160 plus two. You can come now. Yeah both because I'm competing Friday morning. So I'm competing in open on Saturday and masters on Friday. I thought we have some athletes just like to get 10 in the morning. I figured we'd do an overnight tonight and then I'd want to just do the top coat in the morning instead of doing a top coat tonight in sleep and then does that make sense? Are you cool? That's what we're going to do. So one coat today, one coat Friday, one coat Saturday morning. Does it make sense? Yes. Are you also going to lose for the men's facial blending? Yeah I want everything. But so the men's facial blending is a separate service that we do for the men. I'm going to have Korean expanded to you. No, no, no. No, no. Tell me about my blending of faces. So what we do for you is how it's gray and I'm not too pretty well with this. What do you want in covers? Any blamettes? Like we take a car for you. How much is it? It's 70, 90. Now I'm good because yeah I think it looks fine. Okay cool. Sure I just had back then. Can my camera person come with me? No, okay. Yeah everyone's naked. Okay. Sorry. So we're going to the sixth floor now so we can check in. So final call is 845. Park it Marina Jack. Walk across. All right got you. So flash calls 830. All right got you. Thank you ladies. Put this stuff up. Upstairs. I'll go down to Valle. Let them know that my phone's in the car. Because I think I need my confirmation to get you all your passes. Unless no. You actually don't even need to come with me when I go hunt on my phone. But then you wouldn't be able to reach me. If I get lost. But I'm a holly can get lost. It's pretty straightforward. That's why we got to set up our walkie talkings. But yeah we tried to walk a tuck. I left my phone in my car. Yeah. I don't need the car. I just did the phone out of that. It's in the center console and the charger that's built in. But he's snat rocket. That sounds like a metal band. Bro so. Chedit. It's so funny. I wish it was from anodoro you guys. It's not snorning anodoro. Snorning anodoro. I actually prefer my anodoro, but he actually. So yeah, one of the temperature change. We were just talking. I got rhino-sethamplasty. He's like, dude, your nose is like a Lego piece. He had no tip to the nose. You're anything like that? He's so gushing. Bologna is his. Anyway. So I was like a wish I was a good story behind it. But there's not. You look nice and tan. I do. Did you come down to Florida earlier to tan a little bit? No. I just did a couple of coats. Couple of coats. No, you look good. That's a good thing. We should put my third coat. These are Brandon by the way. What's up, man? Todd, that's me, shit. What am I on stage? Um, tomorrow. Probably. Friday. Friday and Saturday. They're going. Okay, I'm going to run in there with you. I'm a brand and they're not going to be taking this for 40 minutes. The girls were set six, minor six. Unless you're getting spray painted. No, I'm not going to. All right, then it's just check. What's this? Oh, thank you, bro. Cool. I'll take a picture with you, but I should probably do without like a stop. No, I like the. You do? I like it. I like it. I like it. All right. Who's taking this picture? He's a good camera. Yeah, that's a good video. That's from video. Brand you want to get pictures of us? Yes, you probably. He's a color one. So, so, you're doing open, obviously, right? I don't know. Man, I know, open, man. Oh, all. Man's physique. Okay. God, you're fucking huge. This huge, huge, huge, huge, huge. I think how much you think this. He's looking like that. I would say, two or four. Okay, my therapist, two or two. Okay, so what are you right now? That, two or one. Yeah, I just want to wait. Why do you want to fast it? Like, one night, yeah. Today, one night, midnight. Okay. I woke up at one, seven, three, this one. What's your recap? Well, it depends on what my height is. It should be one, eight, two. And a wait till I can check, wait in, then I can eat. So I'm dizzy right now. Oh, so. I got a way in, then I can be right now, I'm pretty dizzy. Mm-hmm. All I'm classic, yeah. I have to. I have to. I'm just watching the bathroom. All right. I've got you, man. Man's classic, open, over 35, over 40, over 45. Correct. I'm just signing new this one, man. It's all nine, four, it's five. Yeah. Take this thing, you can get it. Yes, sure. Where would I get his backstage pass and VIP tickets inside that room? How do you get how you're invited to go? We're going to go, are you? Okay. One, nine, two, point three. There's a bar key. Yeah, I don't have to get one. Oh, no, the other way. He had a pair of things. I see. I see. You are. All right. So let's get your hands together. Nice and tall. Just a fraction. Five, four, a half. Oh, yeah. All right, go. Let's go. Give me the left hand. So you're on a train, you can go on a train. Left hand. With a lot of power, my friend. Good. Good. I don't have any power left. I need to eat. Look, I'm done. One thing for your. No, no. All right. Now, is this my official height for life? Five, four, point five. After three, after three, uh, measurement. I'm going to have you. No. Well, I've done one in taxes and I have three shows lined up this month. So then your third one, after your third one, and your start starts rolling up right here. All right. So that's, it's never going to be lower than this then. No, I should. OK, well, I should. Number one. One need to for life. Mission is accomplished. It's OK. We're going to get close. And I'm even at that close again, but we're going to get close. Hello. I'm competitor 12, Todd Lee. And I'd like to start when I'm on stage. We got the same sense of humor. We got the same sense of humor. What is this? This is your bad first. All right. Now, I also bought like backstage passes. Smart money. Gotcha. All right, cool. What do I have to present? Like a confirmation email. Like kind of thing. OK. Cool. Number 12. I'm going to do numerical significance to this number. But it's cool. The height came in a five point five, four, going to 60, 64, .5. So yes, I do have to come in at one 177, probably two more times. But after this one, like come to Troy, no matter what, because I'll have had three official hidings that 64.5 will stick. And I can be 182 in Detroit. It is satin stone. I checked with he's the state chair of Florida. We're good. We are good. Here's Kai's food. Kai's very hungry. Here's Kai's fork. Here's Todd's food. Todd is very hungry. Let's go find a table to sit down. And I don't hurt. He's preoccupied with the camera. I'm just going to leave my shit here because I don't want to fall. So I got 64.5. So that means I'm good for Detroit. But I still have to come in at one 77, the next two shows. Um, one 76.5. Nice. Yeah. So they, I checked with three different people, including him, that as long as I do two more shows, then come to Troy. I can be, I'm one, two. Tomorrow, your first two meals will be solid like this. And then I'm going to kind of microfeed you with rice cakes and stuff. I love right now. Because your shows are rolling, show tomorrow. You'll be, it's just rolling. But you'll have dead time. I'm confused. Do I go pre-chews and pre-chews and finals, finals, finals? You're going to be judging pre-chews and pre-judging. They're going to fish all the other divisions and then they're going to start with finals. Oh my god. So you'll have a good time. Yeah. So like, I'm probably going to, honestly, you'll probably have time to leave and come back. And what's funny is if it was in the hotel, we would just go up to the room. Yeah. So now they'll tell. You know, why would they do that? That would be a big set. Airbnb is much closer. It's just 25 minutes per week. What was it for you? No, it's closer to me than. So there's one duty over 35 I think is going to be very, I'm competitive. I'm competitive. Very competitive. How very competitive. I didn't really see anyone else when I got painted. Oh. Oh. Where's the Russian? Oh, thank you. But you don't like her? Yeah, I guess I could put, but not put, like, well, it's me salt on everything, but I could put honey on that chicken. And be almost like him. Be like honey chicken. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like what a bourbon chicken. Yeah. Let me do that. I was like, help. You're right. This is the guy that puts bacon so that's why I'm not free. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. It's so good. It's a great thing. So you're going to have like a text. You guys have a couple of years down. Like how much sodium you've been doing. He goes. I've been doing 13.7 grams. Sodom. Yes, that's correct. Sodom not salt. Yeah. I know. Sodom needs to cut this shit. It was like 30 grams of salt total. 30 grams. We did. It was full. Bacon's going down. Yeah. Yeah. And that alone was like, seven gram sodium shift. And then he started losing a bunch of water. And it started looking a lot sharper. And I was like, well, would you figure that? But boy, is it delicious? It's carbonated water. And it's dirt cheap. Not that I have to save. I'm that kind of stuff. I think it is a performance benefit. You can, well, I don't know. Here's my rationale. People say, by carbon, it's going to buffer the lactic acid here blood, right? Yeah. But it has to make it to your blood, which we just go through your stomach. So you've got to hydrochloric acid in your stomach. So it's just going to protonate the, by carbonate, make CO2 gas and water. You're going to burn. And you're just going to burn. So everyone's drinking bacon soda before the gym. And they just got this big gloomy stomach. I inject the sodium by carbonate. I do your good. It's a little bit of that. How do you do that? How do you inject bacon soda? There's a company that makes an inject. All right. I need to get on this shit. I'm going to inject arm and hammer in my IV bag. Dude, because you're saying if you rehydrate with saline, you're going to look like shit. And I was like, well, a bag of saline has got nine grams of salt. So that actually makes sense. Shit. Yeah. I was like, that's probably why if we got Rieger's lactate, instead of salisodium, maybe it would look different. Not your two-sour for your own gas. You, I'm trying to catch up with you. But yeah, could you ready to pick what the meal is already up? I have a tentative plan. It's just on the morning. We'll see how you wake up. And then if I got to change anything, we'll change it. But right now, I have a tab for you for tomorrow. Meal one, meal two, are written just so we're prepared. But I'll probably have to adjust those. It's going to be both rice or potatoes. It's going to be mostly rice, honey. Mostly rice and honey. OK. And rice cakes. Now, not that it's a yes, but not that I want to do this. Let me know. They do have a kind of natural breakfast at my hotel with like eggs and coffee. And I can only have a cup of coffee. I'm going to fuck with it. You remember back in the day when people used to have pancake cakes and shit? The war room in the Shusha and the Shelby Sirens pancakes and salt. I'm not risking that, man. Use lots of salt. I'm like, how much is lots? Lots. It's like the most important part of it. Lots is that a member. To the venue, I'm just bringing rice cakes on the butter, right? Rice cakes on the butter, honey. And the battle made possible. I'm going to take you. Fried rice. I'll take you a list of them. And then which ones do you're, which ones do you're pump product? They both have, which one has glycerol? Both. The pre-workout and the intricate work on both have been. Which one doesn't have sims? Neither of them have sims. Which one has less citrally? The intra has no citrally. They'll probably use that. OK. Because our water probably won't be high enough for citrally to work properly. OK. Because what John's you was saying was that he flattened out like a motherfucker in a 90 minute pre-judging. He didn't have carb powder. He just had rice cakes. Well, that's because, well, that's what you solved that with honey. Right. I see. OK. And honey, honey digest a little bit more slower because it's a blended sugar. Right. And so I did, but I was like, all right, I will break battle me. And if he says not to use it, that's cool. But at least we have it. It's better to have it. That's your liquid carb. Mm-hmm. Well, it's got EA's. Yes? Yeah. And also, it's glucose disposal agency. What? I have glucose disposal agency in my entire... Oh, it's in the interest. It's in that. There's our ALA, and I brought cinnamon, and then it's got a Van Del Solfe, chromium picking, and all the way. Does Van Delet mess with you like, like, make you tired? I got a lot of people like it to team down it. Probably because they're not eating of carbs because they're... Is it with it? They're stimulating insulin receptors. When a lot with it? I want to be a chemi girl who used battle made when they didn't have carbs in it, they'd fainte. OK. So I had to start putting carbs in that. But I used that HCBG, the high molecular weight carbs. Do you want me to hold it up? Yeah. And... And... For our big, small, and one for the sea. Three for the first. For our big, small, and one for the sea. Thanks, buddy. Appreciate it. Thank you. Look good. Thanks, man. Thank you. Good to know how I can sleep. Yeah. Now, he did it for me. We got way pro hot cocoa. We'll see here. This is 1.5 grams of fat. That's not bad. Three carbs and 20 grams of protein. So that's something that actually sounds like a lot of fun. We got a little baby, shake your cup. Well, so we got an energy drink called omni, Kyle Drink Thus. It's got only a million milligrams of caffeine. No, it doesn't. I don't see any caffeine. Maybe I'm wrong. This is energy. It's got to have caffeine in it. 200 milligrams of caffeine per can. It's got vitamin B. A bunch of vitamin B's, some potassium. Only a little bit of sodium to help omni like omni man. That's Kyle's favorite show is invincible. Got raw sugar, man body wash, black coconut and sea salt. Something tells me this was not designed by men. I got a toothbrush. This is like the most, this stuff. Well, interesting. Two toothbrushs. Okay. What's this? The wash sugar, the moisture smoothie, shampoo. Coconut agave and sweet almond milk. All right, South Beach, here we come. All right, so, Revit, extreme caution, Reable for consuming. I don't really need to. We got to warn me not to drink it. Then I'm not going to drink it. I know it just comes with a straw first, Nording, a brush sugar, Simply body wash, sensitive skin. I got a sticker for the Florida Pro. It's this, A-D-A-Ballock. At a Ballock, not anabolic. Muscle, hypertrophy, fastest, Most effective formula to offset a catabolic state. Candy Bliss, anabolism. Size. In case you didn't know what anabolism I meant. All right, protein. Is that C0? Yes. The zero grams of protein is 12 carbs, zero sugar. So what is in it? Directions, instructions. No ingredient, what's though? No way, hold on. Glycox. Homo, Holly's sec arrived to arrive from Rice and Potato, 12-Band. Made of alinean, creatinine hydrate, glycerousize, beaten, beat of algeras, and then amino acids. So it's kind of like babamide, rusted AF. Something. It's hyperaggressive way of getting rusted. All right. Promotes REM sleep and GH secretion fruit punch. It's got GABA, 2.75 grams of GABA and glycine. Got KSM, Ashwaganda, Levin Ball, Theonine, Simply, I like this. The laryan root. Almost everything that was in Dragon Dream, just in hearing a bunch of other stuff too. I'm not going to remake Dragon Dreams. I'm going to give it my new products. I'm going to call it Koma. Because then Dragon Dreams wasn't clear enough. Got a pin. All right. So as far as good a bag to go, this is a pretty good haul. Usually it's just some crap that was just thrown in. Aside from the energy drinks which Kyle Drink, I've got a bunch of moisturizers and sugar and poo. And then something I would actually use as an intern. Something I'd actually use as a sleep product. And something that actually looks like really good protein. I don't do way, but if I did do way, this would be the way I do. And the sugar cup to actually consume these beverages. Very thought out, goody bag. All right. So to recap, hopefully you can hear me. The goal is 64.1. 64.5 was achieved. Had to be under 177 in KSI was 64.0. But I was 176.4. So I was actually six pounds lighter than I needed to be. So I'm mission, every mission is accomplished so far. What if they could bring the athletes? They covered how grateful they were that we were there. And how happy they are to host us here in Fort Huff. Do you talk about the words between length? Yeah, they'd have no idea. They just made it way more confusing because they don't know what to do. That's going on. But I figured it out. It's 30 seconds in pre-judging and 60 seconds in the night routine. But I'm not going to walk off after 60 seconds. I'm going to finish my fucking routine. And I think want to turn my music off, that's fine. Nothing's grosser than the smell of a chili. Everybody's valet. It's mandatory. That makes sense since there's no parking. Yeah. I tried. It could be a text rap paid online. And then I've already... Oh, shit. I didn't even think of that. I don't even think of that. I don't even think of that. I'm going to turn pro-life to every valet or 100 bucks. Even the ones that never waited on me. It was one throw in his hand. I was like, two dollars. So I had to do it. I'm like, fuck yeah, I did this is for you. I'm like, no way. That's so fucking gross. Dude, element is the nastiest shit ever. It's like chili mango. I don't fucking know. Is it my car? It could be like two years old. It's so gross. I've never had water. I hated more in all my life. It's like torture. It's like being a pirate and drinking salt water. I'm so thirsty. And then you sip it and it's just like, parrot, piss, penis, collada. What is with all these giant s-geaps? Like you're not cool. You're just like two porters of urban. I'm sure it's expensive too. It's even an American car that costs money. That isn't electric. It can make no sense. The last two hours were hard as fuck. As soon as the elation wore off that the number one goal was accomplished and I got heighted at least once at 64.5 and made weight. So that for the rest of my life, my weigh-in weight is 182. Then every bit of stress was gone. And because you adrenaline more off, the stress wore off. Now my body's just falling apart. It's just like fuck, cutie-todd. So we gotta get back. Take pictures first. Then get weight. We're not even going to walk to the room. We're going to walk right into that little area. I'll strip down. We'll take some pictures because I still got my trunks on. Set them to down immediately. The scales right there. Way in, sending them to the scale right there. Then I will get started on meal four. I'll probably feed you first because if I don't make you meet, you'll forget to eat. Because my meal is so confusing. If I'm trying to prepare yours in mind, this is how I'm going to fuck it up. Dude, some of these dudes had the most amazing physics. Then there's me. I'm black. I'm black. I'm black. I'm dark. There's my car. We're out of heat. Let's up, bro. Thank you, sir. It's the last thing. Lee. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. You too. Just get the fuck out of that. Autobots roll out. Those go. Move the fuck. Let's get the hell out of here. Even the sound dude isn't pressed. So this is heavy. His fuck is like, yes it is. The most important thing happened. I got height of 64.5. Now 64.1. 64.5. And we came in at 177, which was completely unnecessary. We just have to do that two more times. We don't have to actually make 64.5, but we have to come in at 177 to more times. In case for whatever reason, we get height of it at 164.0. Because then the string of three gets collapsed. But if you can do three in a row, I found this on the wind. But you know what's talking to you? Three in a row. The first ones all I needed. My lifetime cap is 182. So after the Detroit Pro, we're going to reverse diet into the Detroit Pro. Then we have a full off season where we can try to put some real muscle on. And then 2027, I'll do the masters in limpio.
