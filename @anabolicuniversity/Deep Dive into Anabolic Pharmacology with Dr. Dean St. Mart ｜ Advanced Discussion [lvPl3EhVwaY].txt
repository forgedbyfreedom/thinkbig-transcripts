You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. Well, hello, everyone. Thank you for tuning in. This is a special episode because we have Dr. Dean St. Mark. Dr. Dean St. Mark has a PhD in is it biochemistry sir and synthetic chemistry? Oh, synthetic chemistry and he is probably the most educated person on the internet discussing the molecular structures of anabolic pharmacology out there and we're going to talk shop. If you guys start getting a nose bleed, you should have some Kleenex on and hand because this is some high-end shit. This is definitely going to be an advanced discussion episode. So without any further delay, why don't you tell us about yourself? Thank you very much for inviting the on-tod. So yeah, as you said, my background was synthetic chemistry and prior to that, I studied pharmacology. So I have a double honors degree in chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. And that was sort of what led me into the fascinating worlds of PEDs during my PhD. I got very interested in body building and then when you're in like your early 20s, you're a little bit naive to what's going on in the fitness world, you're reading like muscular development and eventually it started to see that there's a whole order side to body building that applies to performance and hand syndrome and pharmacology. And I guess at that age looking online, obviously forums, it started to develop but it really post on forums, by a very interesting reading what people were saying. And then you started to realize that it was almost like a dark ira to where people were, it was trial and error basically. You see what works, you didn't work until you had some clever people like Dan Dushen, Patrick Arnold guys who started to apply some of the chemistry into the realm of body building and that's sort of where we've seen probably over the last 15 years and a ballic pharmacology's kept to the place that it's been. Yeah, and I would say that you had a huge impact on a lot of the recent developments. Yeah, I mean it was more so you're looking at some of the discussions around psychol set up, dosages described. And it just when we look at pharmacology and dose prescription, obviously what like conventional medicine, most drugs are designed around a standard dose and then you tie trade to dose from the response. That's really how like aloplatic medicine is developed. You study a standard dose and you apply it to everyone and then adjust to under genetics and lifestyle and everything else. And I just found it very interesting that 500 milligrams of testosterone on one person could completely behave differently in the northern person. So you can really apply this as the best cycle that everyone should be doing because it's such an individual response to the drugs. And I was trying to get guys to explain when it came to PCT, the power PCT, Dr. Michael Scali's protocol is amazing but somewhere along the way people are like starter PCT after two weeks with these drugs, when there could be still PDs in your system from slow clearance. And so you're starting hate cg to restart your your testicle production of testosterone. But you've still got to shut down hate pta because you're still non-drolone decanoate or echo poison your system for six, seven weeks after your last shot. That I just got tired of seeing guys and forms getting to the end of their PCT, following that like two-week clearance, doing the whole protocol hate cg, climate, to moxven. And then their bloodwork shelter that their HPTA was shot down because ironically they finished their PCT as the drug was pretty much clear from their system. So trying to get guys just to think about when you put the drug into the system, was the logical set of events that happens in the body between absorption, distribution to the tissues, the metabolism and the excretion. Get them to think about those processes on top of like dense standard dose selection. So you do a lot of interacting with people online. Do you find that people actually understand what you're talking about or do they just not in smile and they want you to think their smart. So they act like them and stand you, but they have no clue what to how you just said. I guess a bit about I think when you sort of try and speak from high level academic perspective quite often it can be probably misconstrued that you're two intelligence and that's why sometimes it is good to try and bring analogies or simple ways to explain complex problems which I've tried to do but I guess when we look at what isn't a current landscape online and if you can't deliver a simple message and like five to 10 seconds on something complex people are interested anymore. Like long form content if you're real is any more than 30 seconds, it doesn't matter what information you're given you you're more than likely not going to hold a lot of people's attention. Which is a shame because we're we're in a place within the body-building community where we've got access to a lot of information and a lot of good information but unless it can create hype or you know create some sort of not controversy both discussion and engagement you lose a lot of the online audience. I've had to completely redo my style. I used to do 50 minute videos on YouTube and now a lot of this stuff I shoot is just two minutes and I have my editor pare it down to whatever he sees fit for example. I guess ran a 60 day DHB experiment to determine whether a it's an AI or not like the rest of it's super family which I call bold and own it's whole family and that DHB falls in the bold and own family with pre-mo. I believe pre-mo fits in the bold and own family because of the double bond of position one and then because it's structurally identical to DHB it just has the muffled group at carbon one and that I wanted a to figure out theoretically more than 10 seconds. If I want to a figure out whether or not it's an AI because if it's not an AI then it's a good substitute for master on in this master on shortage and what I determined was 10 DHB generated a 55-estrodial 30 DHB a day generated a 58-estrodial therefore it's not an AI and just a double check I ran a quick shot of EQ 30 milligrams for three days so it shot my concentration up to 10 you know because triple the dose for three days is basically a month at the correct dose right so and I crushed my E2 right down to 38 after just three days so I know for sure that since EQ is still an AI in my body I can draw the conclusion that pre-mo still an AI in my body and something that I thought was amazing was that I was looking at some of the material that you had sent me before very okay so this is a double bond at position one and normally pre-mo has a double bond right here and a single bond at position one and this is a metabolized version what I thought I think it's the 17 OHA or hydroxyl one methylene so this is been metabolized I believe it the liver and then it creates this double bond here which you would not get with the HB and this is what actually occupies the aroma taste and sign biting site and non-activator but it does occupy the sites which competitive inhibitor where as DHB would not have the double bond and thus would not find it that binding site is that an accurate assessment of what this picture shows definitely I mean that that that that meteline that won't meteline I guess metabolites are chemical reaction if you think about it you've moved that double bond from C1 C2 to that meteline substituent that is on pre-mobone you could never do that in a lab to mine knowledge that's like if you imagine your bodies don't that chemistry in your liver it's absolutely incredible poor as you yeah rightly pointed out I send a TB4 when you look at the mechanism of of a raw matease and the actual binding site of a raw matease you have this like flexible hinge called the gatekeeper of the raw matease enzyme and it's basically like a claw that swings in and out and anything that's flexible enough to go into the enzyme binding pocket will bind to it but if you imagine you've got that will meteline group there it's not going to be able to reduce that double bond to create an estridile or a raw matease that a-ring because that's what we're basically doing with create an estrogen and so yeah it could competitively block in order a raw matease will compound like testosterone from entering into the binding site to estridile so you've got this competitive antagonist if you want to call it that where it's it's going in but it's not creating any metabolite of itself and I guess when we look at order things that could happen and I'm starting to slowly think that it's not just about your raw matease enzyme where we we look at like competitive in a bishop with the raw matease enzyme where you're lowering estridiles conversion from satis to stastro you could have activation of an andrium response element by somebody's metabolites or the paired compounds that makes the estrogen receptor less functional so now we're creating certain like qualities to these drugs as opposed to a raw matease inhibiting so if I'm understanding your inference if this didn't have the mathic record position one if it had a mathic record position two like master on and to having a double bond right here we had a double bond right here it would look more like anodrol and it would not be an AI it would be just a different form of agonist for the adrogen receptor is accurate yeah and I guess that's where when I'm starting to see now the potential genetic differences where for one person master on my lower estridile for another person premable on a mightlore estridile it might be too completely separate mechanisms where we're getting we're getting lost discussing aromatase inhibition ryan looking at I guess I asked I asked AI I had a good discussion which ship my own chat GPT model which is taken its own brain from on a fed it between adrogen receptor papers and functional aspects of the adrogen receptor and I asked it first of how does trust on alone on a mechanistic level improve estrogen positive breast cancer explained to me quite simply based on what you know about the adrogen receptor how it improves it and we know that interior acts as a serum in women who have estrogen positive breast cancer but how it does that is when you activate the adrogen receptor and that moves into the new clies and binds an adrogen response element to turn on your genetics what you end up seeing and theory then is down regulation of the estrogen response elements and how the estrogen receptors either don't work as well as they called order down regulated and expression in terms of number so now you've got a complete the order of an you where you're not just folks and on lowering estridile as a consequence of the enzyme that creates it you're lowering the functionality the estrogen from a genetic perspective and that you know I find I fascinating that when we look at like what you've got here the adrogen binding affinity I can't find where we've developed this 300% to 5x binding affinity over testosterone or DHT but even when you try and assess then master on a premobole in terms of this estrogen lower and effect I think it's a lot more complex than what we're we're trying to understand that it comes back to then that what happens when the when the adrogen binds to the adrogen receptor informs a complex which is a of itself a protein complex and that will have its own 3D 3D shape as well when we look at premobole and that double bond between C1 and C2 makes that a ring more plain or more flat so now when that binds to the ligand binding domain of the adrogen receptor you have a completely different shaped protein to if master on binding to the ligand binding domain and depending on the shape with adjunctor it will bind with different affinity to the adrogen response elements of the genetics so again looking at the adrogen response elements master on could be a very good muscle builder for one person depending on how fits into the adrogen response elements premobole and could be the other side where it has a better affinity for what's so big in genetics what I ask this so this is an incomplete chart I wanted to show the first half of it because you were talking about the adrogen binding affinity is the most important thing it's transcription it really is what matters and then if I was to show you take like take a mental note that the second line is master on third line's DHB fourth one testosterone fifth line's pre-mo and this is the rest of the chart where we see that this one was the master on is transcription if this is testosterone at a hundred then the master on sobout equivalent DHB's about three times stronger and pre-mo is weaker according to this and you know I obviously I spent a lot of time training my chat GPT it doesn't make her right but we discussed the you had talked to chat GPT and she had a different conversation so mine is based on mechanism ignore outcome data ignore AMA guidelines ignore colloquial doctors opinions ignore everything except for purely mechanistic data and this is how she comes up with her data about writing by the way it's also the KDE was I think it's hand times better for master on the pre-mo when she did the math yeah and I mean when I asked at the same question before even got into it with mechanistic stuff I asked what was the better compound for well I guess to be even starting the top level in from an adrogen binding affinity and it did say because master on is a more flexible molecule it doesn't have that double bond in theory the ligand binding the main is all around flexibility because that's why DHT has a better binding affinity over testosterone it's a more flexible molecule because you've removed the double bond in the four-five position with something like master on being a lot more flexible it can contort itself a bit better than the pre-mo ball so I think when it comes to like the overall choosing of which is the better compound in my view while the mechanistic data and in my mean look at pharmacology I'm starting to like not really see like which one is better of the two order than try one like what you've done with DHT try one CD outcome data try your CD outcome data and then choose what more appropriately fits to your genetics again for some people master on acting as that serum we have negative consequences pre-mo ball and actin as that potential AI might have negative consequences and it's really about figuring out which one suits your biochemistry best. What I found was the only drawback with DHB is that when I went from 10 to 30 milligrams per day my GGT my liver enzyme that's specific for the liver went from 37 to 87 so it was high for liver toxic. So you're like GGT being the Gluedatium recycling enzyme you're you're looking at a huge demand on your liver to reprocess Gluedatium to keep up with detoxification but it also be very interested to look at the blood work to see in terms of liver toxicity you have them affair it and because obviously ferret and being the local storage form it in the liver of iron if your liver sells dye or they become inflamed they push out ferret into the bloodstream and not ferret and as soon as it's left your liver into your bloodstream the posits iron so ferret and on blood is generally devoid of iron the iron is left to ferret and protein and you're measuring an empty shell use Gluedatium to lower serum iron as an oxidant so I wonder did that occur as well on the blood stuff be very interesting. Well I'll look right and I don't normally order ferret because I didn't know that connection that's a good idea. Yeah I don't actually have it even on my I mean it's been ordered before but I don't have it on my spreadsheet because I wasn't but I can look go back and look at the past labs to see but so if I understand correctly if the ferret's in this high but the iron's low then it was actual liver damage not just but if iron's normal and ferret's high it's nothing to be worried about as happy as we what you're saying. No so when when I look at serum iron the only time I sort of respond to serum iron is when it's very high in serum ferret is a more more probably accurate way of assessing iron overload alongside transferred saturation how much iron is transferred and taken on board you could have a normal serum but you could have a raised ferret and level in my view in a mail anything above 160 170 is too much ferret in your bloodstream we need some ferret and obviously being released to keep our iron storage happy in our body but too much is coming from your liver basically. What you're looking for is a normal transferrin let's say transferrin saturation of around 30 35% so transferrin is like a boss carium iron round the body you want about 35 passengers on the boss instead of packing all is iron onto the boss and then with ferret and we're trying to assess how much is being released from the liver and of course too much ferret and in the bloodstream basically basically basically ferret and being an empty shell you've already dumped the iron out of ferret and intertissue straight away and then that leads to a redox reaction so obviously you've got the fend and reaction that can occur on the body where iron I think moves from push trade to push too so it becomes oxidized and so what you use is glue to tie on to clean up that reaction so ferret and if you're looking for signs of iron toxicity I always pay attention to ferret and then transferrin saturation down directly at iron itself. All right so ferret in his high and iron is low and our saturation is less than 35% then you need more glutathione is accurate. Pretty pretty much an NGGT if there's a nice paper on all cores cause mortality with GGT as a marker of of all cause mortality once it goes above 35 to 50 all cause mortality towards cardiovascular disease risk increases as well so GGT is an important marker that ideally you want to keep it below 30 if possible the sweet spot is in around 50 into 20 and that ensures that you're making enough copies of this enzyme to keep everything happy and recycling but the higher GGT goes the analogy I always make is you're creating more recycling plants to try clean up the mess so you're trying to recycle quicker. Right so my solution to this is in the future make sure to use milk vessel NAC, Tudka and I be able to thio if you're going to use DHB over 10 milligrams a day that because if it's correct and that's a big if but if if Nova that's the name of my Chetchipiti gave herself and DHB is two to four times more anabolic than test then master on but it is neutral to estrogen the way master on is it doesn't lower arrays as to dial and there's no other consequences with RBC's hematocard hemoglobin 8 chtl then for people who have cholesterol problems master I mean I'd be the right choice to each be wood but now the liver's in questions you got to run all this other liver protection to go with it to get your glutathione production up to compensate for the demand of glutathione the DHB is going to put on your liver and when I run people's blood work in the future I'll make sure that I'm going to add to my panels the transferetin feretin the iron the whole panel and that when I'm looking for is to make sure that if their feretins up their saturation still over 35 if their saturation is under 35 then their liver their ggt is actually bad and then we got to change something and start introducing a stronger glutathione protocol when when the transferet saturation is above 35 so you've got too much iron so that saturation percentage is how much is on it so you're looking to keep it in a in a sweet spot not too high obviously not too low and the same affair it's in you don't want to too high and you don't want to lose it's like with with our body the main oxidants are we feel our outer glucose or iron there are two main damage damage to it with with with glucose you've got HB and C where you glycate your reblood cells and then we're iron you've obviously got feretin taking that iron on board in your liver cells or transferet but if that iron then gets a chance to run a mock then you have to start using glutathione because one of the most interesting things that is starting to become appreciated is we've got a process in our body called feretin which is iron and juiced apoptosis so you've got too much iron you basically kill your cells and that's where the negative effects of too much iron in your body becomes a big problem because it starts killing if you start killing cells like kidney cells or around the glommelers then you're going to start having problems with kidney disease so trying to offset iron's oxidation of your body unglucose or like your two main anti-age and strategies if you want to put it that way personally I always run pretty low on iron I also don't eat much red meat because I'm probably in prep or if it's off season red meat is too slow by adjusting so I want faster to turn over but my feretin tends to run pretty high even if my GGC's relatively normal so I'll have to do better investigating about that so I have a chart you said me that was very confusing to me I'm sure it's simple to you I wanted to know if you can explain it a little better because if I get confused the chances are I'm not the only one that will find us fascinating so this was the hate this was a HPLC paper on the metabolic I guess metabolites of drustanolone which you can see in the very top left corner from my side looking at the stream so I guess one of the main metabolites after drustanolone is obviously a to caveat here between drustanolone and the thing to it's right that arrow is a resonance arrow going left and right so it means the igniter be the hydroxy form at the 70 in carbon or the carbon or a form at the 70 in carbon so pick or true is basically so if everyone's trying to follow along the side of the OH or the double bond oxygen so they just act in resonance to one another let me look at what what I did the metabolites then you've obviously got the tree alpha hydroxy dihydrogenase and then you have I think it's the tube two beta hydroxylation which is obviously putting a hydroxy group onto that methanol substituents that's off carbon too so we're moving on with this would still be anabolic here correct this wouldn't this would be more similar to anodrol in structure than it would be inert correct and I mean this is a good question in that when we look at metabolism people think that as soon as a drug is metabolized that's it it's it's not active the whole concept around pro-ormones was you talk a drug that then got metabolized to the active parent and similarly when you take an esterified version of a drug where like drustanolone and nanate has the nanate ester off carbon 70 you're taking that as a pro drug to create drustanolone to hydroxylate form so metabolism basically means that you're transforming a drug into something that's either active or inactive you're you're changing the structure to drug basically a change in the structure doesn't necessarily mean again to come back to it that the compound is useless it just has a different chemistry now so that to beta hydroxylation has a slightly different chemistry in that now you've got a hydroxy group that has potential for electron donation with the oxygen then from there you've got obviously the tree alpha or the tree beta hydroxy dehydrogenase and what we're doing there now is changing the sea double bonds all on carbon tree this tends to start the process of deactivating the steroids. Before we continue this exists inside the cytoplasm and this is the enzyme that breaks down dhp and makes it not anabolic correct and that when we convert this ketone to a hydroxyl group we're basically almost creating estrogen except it doesn't have the three double bonds in the a ring that's what's called an aromatic ring or aromatization is it's got three double bonds that are actually constantly in the city of flux it's really six half double bonds really than three double bonds is this all correct for the audience correct correct yes what you're talking about is obviously resonance of aromatization is creating a benzene ring so you've got to treat both bonds and that that a ring so metabolite one m one when we look at the biochemistry of the ligand bind in the main what we talked about with the Andrew receptor we noticed two pirates that are vital on a steroid for that ligand bind domain that is it seedable bond oxygen a carbon trace or a carbon island a carbon tree on the a ring and a hydroxy group a carbon 17 we know that those two interacts that day don't a today trade hydrogen bonds or electron bonds when they're getting to big chemistry to bind into the ligand bind domain to create the binding interaction but in the ligand bind domain so if you carbon has that in carbon 17 is where it's usually methylated for oral absorption so the difference between for instance this molecule of the standalone and super draw is we would have an extra methyl group here at carbon 17 that's the only difference you should super draw and and that carbon 17 once it goes through the liver it's going to cut off that methyl group and the metabolite is just an alone so that you could say that super draw is a pro hormone to just an alone and that's why super draw was sold as a pro hormone up until 2004 correct and obviously that people were were led to believe that when you took super draw methylated drustanolone which wasn't obviously a classified drug you were taking it on the premise that it would be metabolized into drustanolone and Terry and sure enough if anyone's taken super draw that methyl group still has chemistry or some of the metabolites of super draw has its own biochemistry as a very potent oral anabolic steroids which obviously is very liver toxic as well to to caveat with those metabolites then when we've created m1 with that that carbon tree now being hydroxulated this is sort of where perhaps when we view some of the quote unquote safety of master on or premabole and we have this dihydrogenase pathway at which rapidly activates the steroids and like you said it's in the soil plasma tends to be even in our muscle tissue specifically you may have a metabolic pathway where your body will reduce your exposure to the number of molecules from a given dose because of this deactivation so your body's being exposed to a lower number of molecules but also has a more efficient inactivation of those molecules so if you took in Terry too much you would metabolize a two m1 or onto the other metabolites for you're losing the parent compound but also how right for the big difference you master on dhg in this case though is this bond this methyl group at carbon two pre-vents three alpha hst from being as active so instead of breaking down 190% of dhg or provider in for instance all about 80 90% of this gets through so it might increase the lack of a better term bioavailability to the antigen receptor complex by 80 94 would you see that's a pre-acrid assessment yeah i mean like you said there you're still you still have an active steroid molecule so that that hydroxy group at a ctree on m1 doesn't make it useless to the antigen receptor it's just not as strong at binding that hydroxy group wouldn't be as good of an electron donor to speak but it's still very valid because there's more electron negativity here because this has four electrons available and this only has two electrons available I believe correct so carbon oils are a more potent hydrogen bond and an acceptor so they're going to accept a hydrogen bond because it out the electron density with looking at m1 specifically then you have this inactivation of the parent compound which is sort of premised on like I said that that's sort of safety aspect of you deactivated the parent compound which has the more potent anabolic capability but that can still have activity it's only when you start moving into a further metabolite from m1 will be the two beta hydroxylation that you've moved down to which now you're getting into a very more complex molecule that probably doesn't have great buoyant affinity because of that steric hindrance now you've had a yes we have a hydroxy group at position two so that whatever binding of it's can't really get to this electron dense cluster and I'm a spoke earlier both of these have four electrons available what I meant was there's four electrons right here at the tip that are available so this is extremely an electronegative where this change is makes this electronegative less so and then this you're not getting in between these two oxygens and this is going to be harder to fit a molecule and enzyme around this because of the extra steric hindrance here correct and this is one of like the fascinating things because from where I remember this paper this hate penalty paper was from horse urine analysis from where I remember when I sent it so we're really trying to extrapolate the metabolites we observe from horses towards well the chemistry of humans but I do know that one of the water tests for using drustan alone is to check for that m1 metabolite that trialpha hydroxy's dihydrogenase metabolites and if you get caught with that metabolite in your urine it's very difficult to explain where it's came from you have people that will try and leverage off maybe proviron as a potential source of being caught with it in the urn but distilled fail of water drug tests it's so possible there's no way that a methyl group is going to migrate and provide in from position one to position two that's retarded for you you're fine guys trying to get around like exceptions to try and like have to sample retested so m1 like that with like drug testing it's not just a parent compound you have to worry about it's all the metabolites that come from it and that trihydroxy metabolite is the main one that you're looking for when you take drustan alone as as a steroid and I guess what's even more important to understand there is these molecules are lipophilic so they like to live in fat tissue even if you stop taking drustan alone 12, 13 months ago and at that point you would like to take you've excrete it out a lot of to drug if you metabolize a lot of m1 and some of it does get stuck in your fat tissue because these compounds can due to liking fat as a anary to to reside in and you lose fat tissue you have lipolicis occur and now you release these metabolites that are in your fat cells into your bloodstream and they're now at a detectable level for water to catch you in your intestine your most likely going to probably get caught so body fat levels like when you go back to drug testing body fat levels play a big role and like get caught future down to lying as well it's not just about detection windows you have to think about what happens to the metabolites after they've been created as well yeah I used to do that like if I was super lean and I smoked weed but I had a drug test I would just kick up bunch of clen and T3 and do a shit ton of cardio for five days and try to shred all the body and get off my body so that I cleared whatever marijuana was stuck in my that cells is fast possible and I was pretty good at as no drug test but I'll be able to do it by double this body fat I was like yeah yeah bodybuilding saves the day it's like nobody knows how to be a drug addict like bodybuilder not not not that I'm condoned and yeah that is obviously a big role that when people I guess even now like drug tested athletes and biological passports it is going to be very difficult to use compounds like this without getting caught as smart as we trying to be with so based on this graph here if this is still slightly in a ballic this should be as well because the only difference is the direction this comes out at the viewer at a three dimensional model this goes away from the viewer right yeah if you think about it though in theory yes but when something is pointing down and pointing up we only have to think about five alpha dht and five beta dht which is which is for that matter right it's in there the the the resimic miss mixture only fifty percent of it is actually anabolic and that's so because when something's pointing up it might have space to go to something say that the receptor one of the amino acids binding parts of a receptor is here like a claw and you've got that hydroxy pointing up it's in position to it but when it's pointing down because that a ring is like in chemistry a six membrane is rigid but it's also like a chair or a bolt it's either down or so so right you've got that influence in where that's that stereo chemistry is as well so I won't be able to say which one I mean the D'Tree alpha in theory with a pointing down versus the tree beta pointing up knowing that five alpha has affinity with its that pointing pointing down over five beta I think the M1 is probably going to be the better of the two on that aspect by couldn't say so we could have a general although not a hundred percent ironclab but a general assessment that if something's x alpha reduced it's still going to be a functional and x beta reduced is going to be deactivated because it's facing the wrong direction now over here we've got the 17 we've converted this ketone at 17 to hydroxyl is this a functional site that's anabolic but do we lose anabolic effect from going from M1 to the 17 alpha HSD version? So if anything that's 70 and alpha HDS version is probably going to have better affinity for the ligand-binding domain so to recap to recap what we want for a good binding affinity in theory from like the structural activity relationship studies they've done on steroids you want to be you want to have that 70 in position hydroxylated? No, not a key sort of logger not a ketone and now to be honest the 70 in alpha hydroxylation when we have a 70 in alpha methylated drug you have the hydroxy on the other side of it so they hydroxyl so when you think about you've got a metal group and hydroxy group to my knowledge after top my head with we're obviously with this one here because now the hydroxy is pointing down again it would depend on where the residue is in the ligand-binding domain which again I'd have to see in front of me to explain a baritone not off the top my head again but that hydroxy is important and the carbon tree carbon oil is important to see the bond oxygen is important there are the two main things that need to be preserved for good ligand-binding domain affinity so in this example we've got this these are both away like this m1 so this is still in an antibiotics at carbon three hydroxy group at carbon 17 we actually have an improvement from m1 to this because we've got it away and then we get the 17b version which like this makes it come towards so in theory this would be more antibiotic than this so I'm looking at a metal testosterone to see where that hydroxy is just off the top so your metal group in high in the 70 in position for metal testosterone is going going down and the OH is coming at you so the OH is a match and the metal group is a dashed line which would be the 70 in beta so on this logic then that would mean that the 17 beta version of m1 is more antibiotic than the 7th and alpha version 79 correct so I had to look at the structure of metal to metal testosterone to remind people people forget like with the metal group what you're doing is obviously the metal group has its own biochemistry as well but you've still got that hydroxy group at the 70 in position on metal testosterone there's no there's no electron negativity you a metal group and there's no electron donors or reducing capability so I can't imagine the metal group is going to be a functional side like a hydroxyl group and similarly so the reason why the metal group was put on it is to prevent first pass liver metabolism so if we don't have that metal group we will have an oxidation of the c70 and that's where you can't take oral testosterone or if you take it to take every two to three hours having the metal group makes it resistant to first pass metabolism so you keep the drug in the system longer put you also interior you will influence because of that metal group the stereo chemistry of the oral drug as well to not go off in a tangent so then we've got some of got the active active slightly less active still sort of active even less active but more active than this but not as active is this stuff more inactive this this is almost completely inactive this is completely inactive and this guy over here is probably also inactive here because we've got the hydroxy group coming at you and so from you know to make it quite simple for someone you look at it and you think then well when you take master on you end up in a position where you could have four metabolites that have activity as well based on one of the four three four so it's not as simple as you take tristan alone and it's it's useless you've got four metabolites that again and tear even they activate an hydrogen receptor and the hydrogen response element from that you then start seeing potentially those estrogen receptor and knock on effects so it's real it's really interesting you start like looking at these metabolites because the order of the other thing that was below it out was literally just a paper of assessing new metabolites in human urine and that was just confirming that main tree keto reduction metabolites which like I said is what they look for when you do a drug test so you wouldn't have alluded to in our previous conversation that you had some opinions about DHB and I of course have already told you my experiment on DHB what are your do you have other ideas your opinions about DHB not right I mean it's not something that I have personally ever tried or I've seen other people utilize I guess what you've experienced is probably what I have always cautioned towards and that is deliver toxicity and deoxinate of stress which then can play over to kidney oxidative stress and I think that was obviously where some of the animal data and aqua poison kidney toxic really comes back to oxidative stress but to be honest all steroids create oxidative stress we're slowly starting to form a better opinion that it's not just one compound bad for your kidneys it could be interiority any compound and it comes back to them like what we just goes to about how are you implement an antioxidant defenses to improve your body's ability to get rid of these things that are causing damage so with aqua poison anyway or ball denone we do know that aromate is an abition aspect from again the metabolites are creates DHB being a metabolite of ball denone but again with with the effects of it what you observed again it comes back to we don't have human studies really on DHB and this this like goes back to how I became fascinated with anabolic pharmacology because most was have scientific curiosity and it's like well I'm willing to personally experiment to see what what the outcome is any equals warned doesn't really mean anything in a huge population but it does offer dated I'd then someone else can go I want to try that experiment to see what happens and that that was what fascinated me about a pharmacogen we're looking at performance and so yeah any equals one is not has zero positive predictive value but it gives you 100% positive predictive value for yourself and then the the boulder known can convert into form of tabilites right there's the five alpha reduced DHB the five beta reduced which is in her it's got an aromatease inhibitor and it's got esterone but as you take it longer the more aromatease inhibitor builds up which then means less converts to the esterone which means more is going to convert to alpha DHB and beta DHB which means that eventually about a third of your boulder known dose is at DHB dose what I find so interesting is that one third of three equals one and if DHB's three times is anabolic as test and eq's must be equal with test and a third of the eq is DHB then really it it's almost like the eq isn't even that anabolic it's just the DHB that's the anabolic part of it but what to also ironic is that if I'm correct and it's a third why wouldn't you get the same liver toxicity out of 60 eq a day that you would out of 20 DHB a day why is it that eq has no liver toxicity because in theory but you know if it wasn't for the AI aspects of the eq you could just run 900 eq a week and that'd be the same thing as taking 300 DHB a week but with the 300 DHB you're going to do a lot damage your liver with the 900 eq you're going to crush your estrogen yeah it's it's very interesting I guess deodoride as well as the the esterone metabolite of Echopoise that quite often it's falsely detected with with a non-sensitive estrogen check perhaps as some hay paddock protective effect because we do know that ester dial has hay paddock protective effect in theory so that could be something that is potentially what you get from eqoise over DHB I'd be just making sure speculation I believe it's one third year as stimulating of the estrogen alpha receptor esterone relative to ester dial correct but you can you can convert esterone to ester dial as well there is to my knowledge there's a conversion between esterone to ester dial ester dial to ester dial and in our body how we actually excrete estrogen is that conversion process of ester dial to esterone and then esterone is hydroxylated amatalated so when you take something like diein dial metane people think O'Dionale metane is a natural way to lower ester dial actually what diein the metane was a speeds up the conversion of ester dial to esterone and then the esterone is metabolized by your liver it's hydroxylated to to for 60 in hydroxy esterone and then you meddle it to to the for hydroxy esterone to clear it out I glued a toy on obviously is important for the for hydroxy esterone to be metabolized and excreted which the force the cancer is one right the curse the gen one yeah so that's an important connection that I didn't make that one staff that I've got to men's estrogen complex coming out soon that has a long with something it's got I three C and the diem and it to clear ester gen it's got seven eight benzo as a partial mild aromatizing inhibitors so it lowers the total estrogen I've got stuff in there to block the estrogen alpha receptor and then I also have stuff in there to stimulate the estrogen beta receptor so you still get the bone and the IGF one from the estrogen so we're not losing any anabolic effect of your cycle you're just getting rid of the feminizing effects of testosterone abuse so and that that's why people when it comes to aromatase inhibition you're lowering your ester dial but you could still have a buildup of esterone and the esterone metabolites in your body that you have not eliminated property which comes back to obviously conjugation and go tell it's so guys always focus on putting the plunder into the bathtub with the bathtub is already over failing you're not draining the bathtub anymore so you end up with this issue where you've stopped making ester dial but you still have high esterone that you need to manage and that's where it's important that when you come at lowering ester dial or lowering total estrogen of the body if that is what you're required to do for a show or what are health consequences that you support the actual excretion of the compounds not just about blocking the metabolism that we talked about you're supporting actually clearing these metabolites from your system right so in laments terms people are so busy with AI's or but they're not or they cut out their tests before the show but they didn't do anything to get the estrogen that's already in their body out and that's where the DIM comes in handy and I believe the DIM is either precursor for i3c or i3c is the precursor for the IM I can get the two confused but I think they also have different functions as well it's more complex than you're at but they they induce basically induce the enzymes to see why pn's items have delivered to do that conversion across basically so you're in theory as well if you're taken DIM to my knowledge at c-y-p wouldn't be one and I can't remember do it all now for again to top my but anything that's going to be metabolized by c-y-p won't be one is going to be induced to be metabolized faster as well so when you're playing around with enzyme and juicers you know dull thing about grapefruit slowing so that again is an inhibitor as opposed to an inducer you could take things that will either speed up an enzyme or things that will slow it down DIM might speed up the conversion of your astrol and it's metabolites but it could also speed up but again I have to look at a pharmacology book to tell you why c-y-p won't be one ultimate metabolizes because I don't know what I'll stop my head yeah it's infusing so with the grapefruit thing for people who are aware that they basically told people not to eat grapefruit with their pills because all these people in Florida were dying because what do you have in Florida you've got grapefruit and old people so they would basically take their blood pressure medication and they have grapefruit every morning and then the blood pressure medication builds up to two high of a level they go orthostatic hypotension which is basically a fancy way of you stand up you faint and then they cracked their head so what was funny was in the round two thousand through 2008 all of the bikini girl all the figure girls my bad all the figure girls had grapefruit at their breakfast with their ECA stack and it was supposed to be a magic thing it's the nanogurin in the grapefruit that deactivates the enzyme that clears the fat lost drugs so it's like what just take more of it or take it more frequently but you'll see that it was like a classic thing called a Mike Davies diet was that it was going to be grapefruit and egg whites with oatmeal for meal one and then it's going to be tilapia and broccoli for the next five meals and for the last and for like 10 years that's all any girl eight and they constantly were bloated and farting because the broccoli doesn't digest but it does have DIM so on paper it's a brilliant diet but egg whites alone don't digest they cause gas and broccoli doesn't digest and it cause gas so you'd have these girls with ripped abs it looked like they're like nine months pregnant and their mean is shit because they're constantly holding in farts while they're trying to squat and stuff so moral the story is put a yogurt to in with your egg whites take it DIM supple and rather than relying on broccoli which doesn't digest and if you want to just deactivate those enzymes that break your drugs down you can use nandergur and instead of having a rely on eating grapefruit but a grapefruit is very filling because it's like that big and it's 15 carbs it's the same amount of mangurins in an orange when the offsteze and you can use an orange and get the same anger and you could out of a grapefruit it's just more filling it's my well it's my 20 look back I have people I've prayed for years so what's your competition history I know you just competed I think last year right yes I was originally a kickboxer and then I had an accident where I smashed the bones of my ankle I went back after it after that surgery I went back dawn the world championships in 2010 alongside my brothers my brothers a very esteemed kickboxer and then at that point I retired and sort of fell in love with bodybell and as a consequence of the rehab of my ankle with the kickbox so I started competing naturally in 2011 and then from that point onwards went the route of T RT so I had high-poken arism so I went down that road and then that road sort of slipped down into let's apply some of the pharmacology knowledge that I have into the the direct side if you want to put it that way and competed from 2012 to 2017 as a classic bodybuilder so this is where like Narbant the IFBB as it was back dead I was just IFBB but now it's IFBB elite the other branch because we didn't have mPC in Ireland and the UK consistently consistently placed between top three to top six and back then that was sort of like between 2012 and 2016 in Ireland that was when bodybuilder was at its peak there was like 25, 26 guys in my class you you know you had a good competition against a lot of people whereas now you'd be lucky to have like a class of six or seven when you compete I sort of semi retired 2017 to you know get married to big boys to get married have kids still trained but it was always like in my mind of like my personal goal like bodybuilder wasn't to be come and IFBB pro didn't really I wasn't like something like a career project that okay I want to become a pro it was more so a personal goal to win an Irish national title like win Mr Ireland so that was always like an underback my head of like you've gotten like top tree you've got close you've won a couple of shows like regional shows in Ireland let's see you know can I get one last go so what I basically almost got a full health screen CT Andrew Graham everything like that after obviously eight in mine years competing got the green lights and basically said right one last go 2022 and I ended up winning my class at Mr Ireland so that was sort of a you know a defining moment where I was I was happy that I'd settled my goal for people follow me I guess after that show I was sort of at a crossroads of like what do I do now you and this is sort of your whole ego of you've been a bodybuilder for like 10 12 years it's very hard to like dissolve that ego and try and figure out what do I do now like you you've done what you've said out to achieve where do I move forward from here and so it's basically just like maintaining my physique basically but then I got my blood work done 16 weeks post show so I'd always wait after a show go back to you know physiological levels and let everything settle down and ever don't rebound so it's letting settling and then keep body fat and check and then move from there and my cholesterol was sky high on this blood work and I'm looking at it going this doesn't make sense like UK measurement my cholesterol was annoying in American terms it's probably like 6700 it was why I mean anything close to it even my triglycerides were at a 7.5 which again on US measurements I think yeah before 500 it was huge and I'm looking at a gun like my trend and my blood work my total cholesterol was never any higher than 3.5 which is like 110 I think US terms like it was always very good and all of a sudden I have this result and I'm thinking that can't be right then I started thinking in my head that's to be the blood lab that has done an a wrong assay or some just doesn't make sense went back complained they sent a new kit we don't the blood draw said the back same results and that was sort of when I taught okay there's repeatability here this isn't an assay this is a problem internally so for about 4 weeks Mia and a not a friend of mine we tried to rack her heads on what was going on but one point at all fatty liver disease both parts of the blood panel suggested none of that whatsoever and then it just came up in conversation that for a long time I had issues with my gut where my I'd have like just bad gut days and I could never put it down I always thought it was just food volume which was naive like in an offseason I'd been 800 900 grams of care of my just okay your body clearly isn't absorbed and the food and it's trying to flush an out so you're having to eat more to compensate but I could never figure out what was driving and then I said to you know sometimes I get quite bad reflux and he's like well chronic reflux is not a good sign you know small bit of indigestion from time to time is okay but if you've had reflux that you've sort of ignored and again you just think it's just food volume just irritate your your sufficus or bad stomach acidity and he said how about like celiac disease have you ever considered getting tested for celiac was like no and he's like well let's add that to denects blood draw and sure enough he found me after two weeks and he's like well your trans glutamines IGA antibodies are sky high you are in fact celiac and then this all clicked in my head and it's like this aha moment of that makes sense why during that prep in 2022 for most of IA gluten free which would be just how I eat like your standard rice diet whenever else and then every time I got a refeed I'd have like breakfast cereal to just get four 500 grams of carbs from a reeds was it rice breakfast cereal or was it a weed breakfast cereal? So it was rice crispies but they have a very mild, very mild, extra-dined which is gluten but it can't be very rich yeah I guess it would be yeah when you've got that sort of sensitivity where you've if you've got that auto immunity you've been gluten free for four or five weeks you dampen all this inflammation and you put in the you put in the source of gluten the day after the refeeds my body just felt like a ton of bricks and I just thought oh it's hot high carbs your body's trying to process it that sort of post high day fatigue but then when we went to care bloat for the actual shows I had the most horrific swelling and bloating after the first day of like our high carb care day ahead of my first sort of warm up show again and in hindsight I thought it was like gastroint dry this the family had stomach bugs you get post viral IBS for your body's sort of trying to balance the the microbiome and it's on my my Instagram page my my stomach looked like nine ones pregnant the pain and swelling was horrific and I just said to my coach let's just go back to like chicken rice stuff that we know digests fine and trying to what you're doing there is taken the glue to my way of like the bagels and the breakfast cereal that went in with the terrible and so it was our clicked of okay now I know why I had all these good problems so I went strictly glue free started like cleaning up my goat cleaning up the inflammation that was there for years some of the hair loss I experienced in my like early turtis was probably due to that on managed seed act disease I mean in hindsight my fingernails and toenails you should just snap off am I a captain can I have to be vitamin A deficiency or zinc or whatever and it's tridysoplements and it wasn't correct in it your hair obviously if there's inflammation from autoimmune to your hair follicles is going to get damaged so by the time I got to the end of that year of 2020 tree into the styroled last year it is what if in my head was like your undiagnosed celiac all these years that you competed what would happen if you don't a prep or you knew you were celiac and you avoided glue to complete how do you look on stage right and obviously I tried approach my wife and said you know I've got this like itch of like just to do a prep to see how I'd look she was a bit hesitant she was like a tart you're retired and everything else and I said to her well if I do a prep and I don't sacrifice like work family everything else that this is literally just a diet and the way I sort of put it to her was there was an NPC show in Ireland three days before a family vacation I just said to her you know you can't stop me getting in shape for the holiday if I just do a diet and it doesn't interfere of family life and if I just go and turn up on stage on the day you know again you can't say anything to me it's a fifty minute drive from the house to the show and she sort of got around to the idea of it's that there was a warm-up show once I started like actually tracking my prep and everything else like that there was a warm-up show before this NPC show that I ended winning the overall app which again was like a nice thing that I'd never wanted overall in all the years that I competed what weight classes you come in it it was a classic your body well classic so I've always stayed classic like the heaviest I ever I ever got my off season it was like a hundred eight kilos so a 236 237 pounds I never I never got way away from like my my court off for classic was ninety ninety point five so to go hundred ninety five pounds so the day of the show you're a hundred ninety five pound fell stage pretty much bang on our bit higher once you've weighed in and got all our inch hydrated so like last year pretty much yeah I don't for a while I don't under eight under ninety kilo body billemitch is you know mid-Laway to lie heavyweight for classic I just preferred the sort of stroke draftspective classic I'd keep that nice like the classic era proportions that the show's last year if I could replicate last year's prep all the other years I competed I probably would have enjoyed the journey of body bill a lot better because with no gut inflammation my digestion was superb I was able to diet on 3200 calories most train in days and then I got refeeds pretty much every four to five days I trained intensity but sort of moved away from complete failure training to one rep and reserve that you know when you've got that advanced training understanding you can train to that level where you know okay that next rep now is going to be the grinding will let you stop here that I never had any of the the hunger, the tiredness, the fatigue, the literary was just like day-to-day living and when I got to like the British championships for there was a new Federation called the BPA which was like a split off from the IFBB in the UK when I wanted British championships and classic body billing for the M it sort of put the final stamp on that or closing of that chapter of body bill and that was happy I said to my wife I'm done and she's like to be yeah until you get another idea in your head and I said no literally it's sort of like where you retire at the top where you've sort of fulfilled your personal goal you go out happy and know that there's no there's no pulling on a string of like come back to this sort of lifestyle or competitiveness so with that mind I'm perfectly happy being retired and just training and doing things for for the level of the basically you were the 2022 Mr Irland and then you won did I hear you correctly you won the British National Championship that year last year most recently you got overall for classic for the British National Championship correct that's that's fucking awesome that's so impressive I'm what what was great for the the overall with the the show to Nord and Irish Championships was my two songs right I earned they got to come up on stage and get medals and it just showed me that the polar opposite of 2022's prep would be in C Eliquero all the inflammation we're trying to keep your literary mind is screaming at you that your tired your big grown be the whole body builder stigma I guess of being an unprept to last you're being very content very happy you know enjoying the journey enjoying being on stage I mean there was a show local here in Nord and Ireland with the PCA British Body Bill and Federation that was like Mr Nord and Ireland for the PCA and I narrowly missed out on winning that by what was literally one point between me and the guy and in first but as soon as we finished that show I did if he drove that show at like 10 a.m. on a Sunday morning by midday we were in a park with two boys and I was covered in tan it was literally off stage the park with the boys which when you look at most body builders were like well what do I do now I go and eat a lot of food or you're focused on the next show to me it was just about enjoying the process last year which a lot of people tend to not enjoy the process as much as they enjoy body building you don't enjoy the journey of getting to the stage well that's an awesome story I think that's a good place for us to end this time I'd love to have you back on so we can talk about some other stuff did you have anything you wanted to add about your services or how someone can reach you yeah so the best place is obviously Instagram DNSTM we do have to supplement companies supplement aids in the UK which are sort of centered around improving health towards body building or fitness so supplement aids to a code at UK's our website on yes I know one story chat afterwards just sent me DM on on Instagram alright thank you so much buddy you have a great day thanks for coming on the show thank you Todd you too great news I am not partnered with talent wellness talent wellness will be able to provide you your medication so you get your consult with me I will review the blood work you
