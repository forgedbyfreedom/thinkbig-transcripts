You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. All right here. So it goes upper lower upper lower upper lower pretty simple. 18 sets of fat, six sets of upper back, nine, 18 sets of direct triceps. And then nine of these halves like pressing. That's from pressing or straight arm. So like I'm pulling, I get hold of it. Straight arm pull on. And then 18 for biceps. And then these are the deep prioritize nine packs, nine hams, nine min adults, a doctorous quads, right weird, right weird out, yeah abs, calves. Okay. So that's how it's laid out. So it goes priority one is lads, so it's a day one. Party two is arm. So I go triceps by some triceps. Blasin. Blasin. Blasin. Triceps. Triceps. Yeah, yeah. I got this. I got this. All right. Because the only thing we did is we added a day. Yeah, I did a day. I meant I found a little match. It might need to come out. Okay. Because I added the day and I put in the my own matches. So we went from 80 to 1. That's to 129 sets. But when I actually come all the way down, I'm pretty sure it's sleep schedule. It's just a bit difficult. And when I count all of my times, I go to failure. It's 420. So when from 81 to 40 to 40. So that was, I said, like, I think I think that volume. I think I think the issue is with these myomatches, right? So I'm going to show you the myomatches. So Friday, go sleep. It came in a training way. No food or sleep. It's 20, it's 60 for 20. And this is 60 for 15 in the 50 for 19. Yeah. So the elbow was on fire. Yeah. So I was going lighter on the elbow. And the knee, I was doing any pressing. But this day, you didn't sleep for you. Right. And so let's get a good day going, right? So Saturday. How do you feel? Fine. Because I've been sleeping eight hours now. Yeah. I usually wake up. I have one meal and go in. I get okay performance. If I wake up, I have two meals. I get better performance. The antitrawl, I get really good performance, right? So like Saturday is a good example. Because there's only two sets for four exercises for band. Yeah. So you can see it goes 12 plus one. Then 13 with a drop set. This one, 13, 12 plus one. Then 16 now is a fucked up one. Then 12 and 12. I have just dropped the weight a little bit. This is also negative weight. So I didn't really have any myomatch reps. So I've progressed from negative 70 to basically the same thing as my weight drop. And then seated row, went from 120 for 12. I'm now 1114. 111 plus one. So this is a huge job. Yeah. Because this straight arm pulled down went from 75 for 12 to 80 for 12. I alternated that. So I'm on one. And then two and three. Then four is the bad side. You want to sit right now? Not at all to say. It's harder with I don't feel shit on the right side. I feel the left lat can check all the way. Whether it's your leg fibers, a lumbar fibers, a thoracic no problem. This is thoracic fiber. Some of the lumbar fibers never the lumbar fibers. Um, now another day is it's a shit show. Like Sunday, the Vulcan Shri Set. 15 reps there. 18 19. I went up on that day. Overhead. That was hurting my elbow so bad. I had to go later. And then with a dumbbell preacher that went from 10 30 for 40 team. Now a mat 30 for 15. So I'm going up even though I'm doing the math trips on some of these days. Yeah. We look at the day like Wednesday. And it's a total shit show. You look at like the way they call your arms. Wednesday and like yeah. So the liebacks. I'm high purpose. 45 for 16 to 20. And then I ended with 45 for 15 today. But I used to do that for 60 before the elbow started going back. But I was going down. Now I'm going like best with that. So that doesn't count. Because I'm getting more long. I'm getting more long here. You know, Brett had his curls. I do the Brett drill 27 for 16 to 17 right here. It's 15 to 17. So we're not really going down. So I want to I hate taking a mile mat trips. Oh, but I wanted you to look at it and tell me because I know I'm doing mostly that. I'm going to go with the time left for the show. Yeah. I mean, I think the my I think the my o matching could help you later in prep. Okay. Like it could come back. I think the my o matching is better for when you might not be able to handle them all you. So we drop a set and then do. So we went to do three sets. We do two sets. My own match. But that's how I got this. I went from four sets to three sets. My own match. And then we look at like the hamstrings. And that's where shit starts going off the rails. I'll this idea I do loaded today, but like it'll be like six to and two six to and two. Yeah. And so I think it's the third set doing two or three rust closets getting four reps and waiting 30 seconds and getting three reps and waiting for them to then two reps and waiting three. Then one wrap just accumulating those. That just fucking varies me. That's a lot of fatigue. Yeah. And then two sets it wouldn't be a big deal. I got 12 and 11 plus one. But if it's 15 and 10 plus five, then five plus five plus four plus two. It's too much. All right. So do we want to take out all the my o match or do you want to leave the one mile match on the second set but drop it on the third. Get rid of it on the third. Leave it on the second. Yeah. Yeah. That's how I would do it right now. Because I think it's good. I think I like the my o matching. I like the rest pausing. I like all that because I think that's actually what keeps muscle tissue. Right. Right. Well, especially I mean elbow and the knee. You need it because you can't get a 7 with this leg. And this leg I can get 12 because I have to go so light that it doesn't hurt. But the knee so it actually recovers. So I'll go 12. Three. Two to get 27. So I'm trying to just have the right match the lot. That makes sense. And then I've been the same thing with this elbow. This elbow is almost completely better. Thanks to Bridge for that. Pushup. The knee is almost completely better. You're tricking using five or four milligrams to be 500. I only do it after leg day. And then now I don't have to use it at all. Yeah. And I'm doing every other leg day. I'm doing a cluster set on a press with very little weight. So four rest three breath and that amount of more. So it goes up to 24 reps with a weight I could do 16 times. And I'm doing it every other leg day for 75th day. And the knees recovering. I'm doing the front wheels. Yeah. And the quad pumps amazing. Yeah. But I feel like a pussy though because I'm not using any weight. Yeah. But it's different. It's just not about stress. Yeah. I want to say Jordan said it best. You trained in all rep ranges. Michael Jordan said he's doing these. I'm doing these. All right. So what do you want to start with? Well, I do want to go through some of the backs up. All right. So my number one go to highest as a far is straight arm. Let pull that. All right. I'm going to take it off. I don't think too much. So I can pro-treat and pull down. Or I can just do what feels natural. There. One time. Yeah. That's right, guys. That's right, back here. Oh, for sure. All right. I got it. Put your heel on that. All right. Now I actually made these swatches. I'll show them to you later. They look like I turn them in the swatches. I just involved swatches. And then I put versus matches in to these. And I can shop it. And then they actually are going to be four inches. That is going to be a must not only for a little more. Can we get a little closer? I'm not going to feel it. It is firing? Yeah. No. It's like I can feel twitching. No, dude. I can feel this. Like this is firing. No, if I can track my abs. I'm still like a feeling. All right. But I feel it better if I do that. No, you need to do this better. Now I put my thumb in here. That's a lot of elbow. It's now my arm. Head of my triceps. If I take it out. Try to bend your elbow less. More strength. Yeah. I don't look like welcome for the bad. I do that feel. All right. A lot. That feel different. I can't feel it. But if you feel it is firing. You got hurt there. What? I know. Hey, do you want to feel this? See if it is the same. I can feel that much better. I got to feel that well. Well, huh? That feels nice, dude. That doesn't. No, that's like that's your thumb. Better. So here's my thumb. Maybe my right side stronger. So I feel the left because if it eat well weight, it's heavier to the left. Yeah. So let me do it. I'm going to try to have your weight. I'm going to try it. At some point my elbow hurts so bad. I can't do it. So I can either do 25 reps or do it later in the workout. But now the elbow is feeling better. And at some point the shoulder takes over. Yeah. I'm just trying to keep this straight. You know that. You know, you're just contract art. Like this has been dragged in hard. Now if I approach, I act. Now the way I used to do is like this. Now the idea of you do this now we're getting like too much candy. And then if I do this, my calves would say my rib cage is bigger than calves in subjects. I think if I do this. Then I get a lot more tries. So straight on. I think like your end position. I think your army to be fair. So here. Yeah. Then it's so much elbow. Is it? Yeah. It's so much tries up an elbow, which is fine. I need try some. But then I lose my my muscles. I'm going to show you my last. This I can feel. Yeah. I do that. You know, another thing that's good on these is like right before you initiate the presser scapula. Okay. Not pro-truck. So contract at the top. But right before you re-engage, drop and then go. So you want me to go push. Yeah. And then pull. Okay. Like try it with this side. Okay. So pro-truck. And then it's like a depression and then then pull it through. So if I do normal, it's like this. I kind of feel a better normal. Which way? There you go. It's almost like it comes naturally on the left. All right. So do you want me to do more? To do a lot of these. Huh? You do have a lot of these. You think so? Like with your elbows and shit. Uh, I mean, There's a her shoulder movement after. And not too much. Maybe. Usually once it gets warm, but once I do one set of tries of extensions, you're fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Nevermind. I usually put butcher bomb on it. I don't like injecting BPC in the tendons. Because then I get a plan from the BPC and you can do, I'm kind of trex too. Was that? It's like topical MSM and hyaluronic acid. Okay. It's really deep penetrating. It's like a thicker than the BPC. So I can mix it with the BPC. I'm going to try the butcher bomb in deeper. All right. I'm going to try. I'm going to try. Do you want me to do another set here? Right. So I did like a full back workout to fail. Like 10, 20 sets of failure when you kind of the mileage yesterday. Yes. Yeah. Yesterday morning, 36 hours ago, I feel painfully fine. Is this the load you want? I don't know. We'll find out. Never held up. Punner passes through heavy. Let's go 50 just so you can watch. See what it feels like. So notice where my elbow ang's is here. It doesn't go back like everyone else has touched. There's take a second. Let's try this. So hit right in here and then you're going to brace with this. And then when you come down, you're going to press first. And then pull. Like, alright. So this is your spine here. Come down out of the way. Alright. You're almost touching your spine. Yeah. I can't do that. I'm small now. It works really. He's just like, oh. You made me the same I do. Like, like, like, dry and dry. I'm going to hip into that. And you're braising hard about that. Push. Oh yeah. Or pull. You're going to pull. Yeah. This is far as we go. Fight. Supernate with your hand. Fight. Good. Alright. I feel enough. Do this can track. I could feel everything. But you see what my elbow is not coming all the way down. I mean, everybody's going to have it. I'll go and breathe. Just because like your human is assured. Ah, okay. Now this side comes all the way down. No problem. Like keep your supination like through the top even. Oh, here. Yeah. Oh, that's easy. Fight. Let's need to be full. It's a lot of elbow though. The supination? Yeah. That. If I come up like this from neutral to 45, I'm fine. Okay. If I try to get the supinated whole time, it's right there. Why is everyone bending over like this when they do it? Because somebody on the internet said to do a crunch. Because I get a little bit more left that way. But I get oblique shoe. And the goal is not to get oblique, but you need to go nicely. Right. So that by point is that we're trying to make a way smaller. Not leaning over is not the right way to do this. I mean, you're in nice and metric hold the whole time. But yeah. I think that's nice. So we got this done. That's actually a nice, that opinion. Yeah. It was boom, building stuff. They have that hammer strength like jungle gym. You can do the same thing on it. I know what I do at Westbone Field. They've got a side-backed shoe with two handles. And I can pull them down. Yeah. It's really nice. The Westbone Field. They're also do this. That double handle thing and weapon fields. I know. That's what I do at Millford. First they do the. I want the nice machines that moves a little bit. Oh, that's too light. Like I think we can end like a little bit like with your shoulders more depressed. Okay. You get on saying like I feel you're leaving a little bit at the top. We need where. Leading. I feel like you're leaving a little shortening. By not coming down with your like depressing or scapula food. So if I depressed my scapula down before I initiate with the. You're there and then now you're all that. What I'm doing is I'm starting with my last by pushing forward. Yeah. It's trying to isolate them. But then I can't suppress them at the bottom. You can't get this whole girdle down. Okay. So like here's like a good like get your like not under a good. Can you drop this down for me? Thank you. Yeah, like that. Like that. That's me. Yeah. This is also there's this is being leaning forward. Yeah. And then this is being doing natural. No, I feel more natural. You feel more here. Yeah, put it put it put it put your hand there. That's the last one you did. That's what. Yeah. I feel way better that way. But that's not the way your supposed to do it. So when I change everything the optimal is when all these problems started. When I do it instinctively, I can fire those muscles to smile. Yeah. All right. So pull ups. If I come in to narrow. That's too close. It's too close. Yeah. If it's supernated, it's my own. Yeah. Like okay. Here. What I think you should do to fix this is come in more. Oh. Are you sure? Yeah. Like what do you hear what ultimately you're trying to do with this is you're trying to get a lot of like Terry's activation. All right. You want me to come in and close. I'm in a little bit closer. Okay. And I think you'll feel it a little bit better here. All right. Stand behind me because I'm having feeling that my hands will be inside my elbow. Where my hands still outside my elbow. Oh shit. You were right. Which I shouldn't be surprised. But like I think if you're going to go away. If you're going to go lighter on these, that I'm not sure. I'm going to lighter. I want more thoracic extension. Then you're pretty much doing like a Terry's blow. But I do that with a roll anyway. Yeah. So that's why I've got you know, six sets with my little match on last. And then I've got two straight sets for a row. Yeah. Yeah. I think you're going to be in and that's it. Like I'd be like, yeah, right there. Like you're peeking at the break. So these are the four. Five. Six. Six. That's almost too heavy. Huh? That was too white. I thought it was too heavy. Because I didn't touch the top. I didn't touch the top. When I come up, I don't, I don't buy them out of the top. And I'll say, oh, I'm only counting the ones where I touch. I think I think even when you could do a little more, if you want, do it, get yourself a little extension. I think a little bit more tea's fine here. And I think you'll, I think you'll feel it even more. All right. Yeah. You're doing a job going up and down. But I think even from here, we're just a little little extension back. And I think you'll, well, okay. You made you a naturally. Yeah. Rather than trying to use just that. Little less, little less. Yes. When I do it that way, it's really light. Yeah. Little less, that's good. The feel better? Yeah. So, that's how I'll quick go. If I go that heavy, it's okay. Because I don't really count those reps if I don't touch. You can count them. All right. Fuck. I think it's like so much easier. All right. So I think you're not. You still stimulate. You're still going through the movement pattern. All right. So I also do this for lower back, because we don't have any deadlifts or hip ventures. Yeah. What do you do like an extension or something? Yeah. I do. One of this, what of is retails? Where they called? He mean them, but they're basically Arnold's. Like a lower back extension, oh, yeah. But you're like loaded with your arms. This is really light. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? I need. Because of these stupid things, I need help getting into this. There. All right. Oh that's really light. Yeah. So I'm about this and then I'll start there. There's a bullet, yeah. And the goal is so that my lower back doesn't actually fit. Yeah. But I don't want to build on my way, see there or my glutes. Because I think you would pre-action be doing hip engines. Okay. So what he's doing there, then got that dy-roll that hand-less-rain. I do that one because I feel my latch really good on that one. Just supporting. That's like almost like that, but that one's the little. Right. That one's super-native. They're both super-native. That one's just an extreme version of it. And then I do the T-bar on another day. You do a top or mayor. I go top on Milford to get the upper back. So I don't really think I need help with the rose because the upper back's probably coming along. It was just the lats. And the take home message is, fuck with the optimal people say. And you just contract your goddamn lat, which is common sense. So why hasn't it grown because I was wearing a belt this whole time? I don't know if it was that. I think part of the reason was I think you just got stuck with some of the operas too. Okay. So, alright, let's go close. I think it was that I think the belt, I think the belt hurts the lats to be honest. Right. So the combination of training like calves and using a belt is why my lats got smaller. Because I used to bend a little. Obviously, as Africa said, that what they fucking say, but I think it's also like, if you don't feel shit. What you told me in 2021, when Cooper started me on this ship, was you used to do 405 bent rose. Now you're doing 135. It doesn't matter how you do them. It's not the same thing. So are we, but I mean, I feel like I'm too old to be doing bent rose for 405. And my waist was just got bigger. Alright, do you want to see my T-BI-Rone time of the day guys done? I'm not a mother fucker. That's too soft, that though. Man, I've been sitting here so long. I figured you were coming down here anyway. You came there just for me. I feel so special. I feel loved. Are you not going to lift that? I said, eh? Yeah. Okay. I still can't lift my left side. Because of the pectare. I didn't mind five miles on today. Alright, chance to get you into that shit, huh? Yeah. Alright, this is probably going to be too bad for me. You're on, who is this too? It should be okay. I'll tell you right now, you get way more out of it during one day at a time. I usually go to, you say I should do one? Yeah. I especially have you're dealing with this. Put your butt back more. Yeah, problem with this is elbow comes out too much. Hey, you need this machine that does. It's elbow swinging too much out there. Your elbow wings too much out there. It's the machine. It's the machine. You got one of us to feel this to do that. Now, check and see if it's the same on the left. I think my right side wings more than my left side does. Yeah, it's the same thing. Like it. This comes out too far. It's like 90% Iraqi 10% Lumbar's Euro-Personile Aga. Alright. But don't you just receive? Yeah. Let's give this T-Bar in. You need to do like my child, like is it all? Like do the pull, lean up forward. I do it like C-Bum style. Was there enough scapular traction? Yeah, I think you're better with your feet on lower and lower. Normally I put a box there and you just stand. And I stand on it. That's ideal. And then they have the hoist at Milford, which is completely different than the Psycharium. The aquarium's great if you've got a box to stand on. The box is over there. I do it on a waste of time. And Milford, I just use one of those aerobic sector things that women use. Yeah, it works perfect. But my concern was if I was getting enough scapular traction, how you do? I don't know if it was any lat activation. A little bit. I mean you're here. This is all for back up. Yeah. I cannot find the one in no way. I can put two boxes down. Use that grip and get my last. That's the best. That's the best. Yeah, it is. I don't even know if I could hit it on this one. That feels good. You have good traction here. All right. So that's back. Is there some other body part you want to see on me, be trained it? Or do you feel everything else is on point? Is this their back, hopefully? Good. Your test is good. The test is only going to strong point. What's funny is my bench is down to 225. It used to be 315. I went I went I was 315 for Chetan. He had seen press of the throat. I re-learned from Cuba to bench like this. Now it's a tricep movement. Yeah. I pyramid it up this time up to 315 for 5. Couldn't get anywhere. It started going to 315 for 2. So I started going backwards. So rather than changing exercises it was hearing my elbow so much. I went to this grip and I started doing up a pire to 25. I'm getting 10. It started to go down even though I'm not using my own match. So I got 12. I'll show you my blood. You'd have always noticed pressing and dieting first thing to go. Right. Right. So with the dumbbells I was doing one 10 for 8. It started hurting. So I went 85 for 12. And I'm at 90 for 12. So for some reason pressing always goes with dieting. Yeah. I do not even cross the board. I'm cross the board. See I'm going to show you how I built these. So you know what how the problem with the squat chooses they got narrow ass toe boxes. They'll work. So if you use GH and you've got these have it feet that are like a size W. So these Nike's actually stretch and they got the the umple lumpa holes so you can look at tall figure holes. So I got those and then I put in a verse a wedge so I can stack these in here to change the pitch of the shoe. And then I put in the sole from the squat university squats you. So I can then jump and bring it as toe boxes. Yeah. I can't wear a spot you. And so over there. Right. And then there's no bell crow. So if you were to take a one and date they don't have it. You're married so this doesn't matter but for us it was having bell crow shoes it basically looks like you're retarded. Oh this is cool. I didn't know they had this here. Yeah this is brand new. Wesley Vister just told me about it ironically. I'll get there all here for the digital ground. Yeah. So that see how my lower back I can get it some activity there. And then I can come up here I can contract it come back and I can turtle back it or I can do ad contraction or I can spinal thoracic extension which looks like that's very start. Okay you're together. So you have a lot of options here we're not you. Oh you're looking at it. Yeah I've got that's how I see what I'm doing. Okay go ahead. So that's yeah. Well like I've found it at blind it would just look at this. Okay I can already see so many things. Okay do it blind again like that. First thing we're going to do is we need to get these forward more, more pressure. Yep and then we need to lift your sternum up. Right it's easy. It's starting a lot more. There you go. A little bit more with your shoulders forward. There you go. That looks really better. Is that more lats? Yeah then I can contract them or I can relax them or I can stretch them. So I'm going to tell you relax it and the problem with the stretching. Yeah we get more depth or we get more width when we move this right the balance of the tube. So if I do a vacuum and stretch it watch what happens. Okay but we're too flatline. Okay so you need me to arc back and dude how long can you hold the fuck of that before in a back hose? Where will that oh get 18 weeks to do it? We got 18 weeks the linear I get in the less you give me. The easier you don't get it. Well then there's a Chicago pro. There's we're not doing this guy or pro. Okay then there's the lendemary. That's an end of the octagon. Right but that's we could do two 12 masters and classic masters. That's an August. Or we can do classic and classic masters or you could do two 12 and two 12. So we don't have to hit the 177 threshold before we start competing. We could do the two 12s and then do once we're lean enough we do the classic. Yeah all right because I got posing music for both. See if I exhale she got my lads pop. Can you actually see that back in here from where you are? Yeah Kai. Okay but see how much can you tell if you get that last. Yeah but I'm going to take a picture of you from the side I'm going to show you what we're going to see. Go ahead we do it all that again. Okay like look at this so taking break look at how straight you are. Right we want me to lean back you need to come to my bar with her hips from you need to lean back from like I would say almost like you're a long martin. I can arc back with the lumber spine or I can hinge back at the head. No you need to arc back. Okay I can then you need to like you need to lift look it out of flat. Your chest is green and chest up. You got to lift your sternum more. That's yes and shoulders more forward there you go. Look at that. Swing better. We better. We better. All right I mean it had a call already. That's so much better. Should all of us forward more. Yes. Should all this forward. There you go. That's way better bro. So it's I have lads you have lads the whole time. I was supposed to rub. I'll do your double lads. All right that was way easier. I'll have to do it this way. It looks different. Do it again. Do it the other way. Was that what you did? I like that more. Let me show you. No I can also lean back a lot more than I've been leaning back. If you want to. No so I'm going to tell you what the pilot told me about that. Who was it? I had an ex-ozyc pro do Texas. He said we asked like you know how much I'm talking to. How do you get seven? He said he was leaning back too much to the point where now it was creating roles in his skin. To us at in the crowd it looked great but to then it looked terrible. You're at judging level. So that's why your lean was perfect with what we were doing. So here here. Yeah and then we see the shoulders looking more forward. All right if I go forward I can check my lads. Do you want them to attract it or not? Yeah like that. So contracted. Yep. And then back you. You don't have to back it. It doesn't help it. Now do we want the hand's higher? Your hand needs to be higher. Your hands low or no. Yeah. So 12 rib and yeah I mean you didn't look at your front lads. Yeah my front lads looks okay. Wait better just a little bit. So from here I'm going to do just a little bit. There you go. Which is ironic we're working all the poses that don't count. All right she wanted to work on someone's the do. That's my classic. This is my normal. I think it looks like shit. This looks like a better look at that. And then side chest. Let's get there. Oh that's probably probably pops from there. I don't know if I can't really change it. So there's a few different tweaks I can do. I can push with the toe. Then I lose everything. Careful with pushing too much with the toe because you'll lose your boot. Yeah that's what I'm saying. I can push with the toe and lose everything. Or I can come over it off center. Do you have any room there? No let's talk. Okay so then I get to see usually if I squeeze my boot. Because I think you could like if you're here like that's how you should you're almost too. I'm way over you have to try to quit more hamster. I'm over doing it. You need to be like just right like right there. Now you're at three you're at nine o'clock. If he's at six o'clock you're at nine o'clock. I try to shoot for I mean you're at three o'clock. I try to shoot for two o'clock so that when I rotate I pull it over into place. This is a retired bodybuilder. Right. So we're here. If I'm afraid better. Yeah so that one is three o'clock. Yeah all right. If you like to talk this too much you'll lose your hamstring. Okay. You're like coming too much forward. So you need to excuse this like back to go. Oh so that's too close. Okay. Yeah so there. It's uncomfortable now but once you've cracked well if I use the ball my foot I can support my balance a lot better and I'm collapsed over. I'm not open. Now I can flare my lat-hout and bring my arm out. That's because you can create this whole thing that works bad. All right. And little bit of like you want to be like look at your chest up over. Yeah and then I'm so focused on the lower body. Not even paying attention to upper body yet. All right. The lower and that and that you're like looking at it good and that. So I'm focused too much on the lower body because I mean I'm covered in fat right now so obviously you're not going to see the detail that I'm trying to bring out and I'm losing my upper body just trying to get the lower body there. It's a slight boost to be able to be able to do it. But you got to make sure these legs are together. I think one of the things we're doing like with your toes you're like almost a little too far ahead. Shoot for her. She won't get in here. Yeah like right there. I mean if you want to crack us a lower body you don't have to do the top. Yeah that was. The glutes will come in. There we go. Yeah. All right. That's not why we're having fun. No you're doing your abs and talking. That's okay. That's okay. Let's say. So I'm just saying you know that's like a mark down now and it's like what that happened by that is. They want a two hand over now. I mean no you could do it angle. Did I think of like fine? But that was something that they said. So I feel like if I could get this leg completely out at nine and I could get this leg. I mean this is a three and I could go this for seven. I could make this look a lot better. That would be a fucking great favorite classes too. Just like oh well this is gonna be my favorite. Yes that's awesome. With a vacuum. You know like this. She likes and then that's what my leg down. I don't like it. No I look it out that. Like down those two amateur. Like you don't know how to like this guy. Yeah. Like every she bought. I'm fucking hate the toe up. It looks amateur. It looks like they're like but it makes your quads pop up. Like but all anyone's looking at is your toe. I'm looking at your quads. Side triceps the toe. That's so. That'll look good though once you're fucking once I'm lean. All right and then there's the two back shit shots. So that was that look good. And better you want to hide that's good chest up a little. There you go. There actually go like that. It's a too much few much. Okay. It's more like a sternum lift. There I go. Yeah. Let me try to memorize that whole. There's that low set. No. You want up? Let's start. Let's do a bc. Otherwise I won't know. A, b, a, a, c, c, c. Yeah. Work d, c. Okay. Like the optometrist. The post doctor. That was good. All right. You're waving your person. I know it's because I'm so fucking pale. If I had a tan, I would've told you about it. You see your left arm, your elbow is from down. Okay. Left arm, elbow down. Left arm. That's good. You almost want to draw a perfect line. Like elbow down. So I'm, to me, this biceps looks like shit now. That looks like the biceps look better. But you're saying from behind it doesn't matter. But from the front, we want my bicep peak higher than my anterior delpe, right? From the back. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Okay. I mean, obviously, it's y'all, but you, you would, you would look, silly being on, on the, on the, even in the back. Right. And the front, we could put my emphasis on the, right there. Is that, yeah, is that better? I can even go full. I can full. He said, all right. No. People like, I don't know. It's, it's such a great delet. Because he's doing this. Yeah. elbow down. Left. Yeah. You just have to get used to that. I just have to fire both legs. You should also, something you should do at home or like, whatever. You need to do some tea spine, like mobilization stuff. So like what you'll do is like this, the knee closest to the wall will be down. Both hands over. This elbow is going to be really close to the wall. And then you're going to rotate like this and you're going to keep your arm into the wall the whole time. And you're going to rotate and twist and then keep the elbow is close to the wall's possible. And then rotate. And you'll do like ten of side. Okay. That's really good for like thoracic. Turn outside how many at once a day? Yeah, once a day. I'll just like do it once a day. And you just keep keep that elbows close to the wall's possible. And as you get as your, you know, trying to come over, you're not coming over by twisting away from the wall. You're coming over by extending up like that. Boy, it's a good policy because I'm going to do that. That's a better. No, that's better. That's better. That's better. No, that's better. That's better. That's better. That's better. That's better. Yeah, about that. No. That looks good. That looks good. I can pull it. You're just a mirror. Look at this here. When you do it, I want like look aside. Look at this. You're your shoulders are. You see your target mom. Yeah, they're all the way forward. Yep. And your chest is nice and high. Left arm. There you go. We thought we went that. And then I can turn back more. That was good. Let me go more. No, that's good. Right there. Yeah. All right. But just when you're doing that, you can your left arm stays down. Left arm. You see how you can draw like a straight line elbow, elbow pretty much? Yeah, I get the concept. It's just my body's not listening. Let's see if that helps. A little bit more. There you go. You see that? Yeah. You know if I'm going to be able to draw a T. All right. Now, I'm not squeezing my glutes for this because that will have glutes of squeeze. Yeah, but here you go. More colder, more colder. There you go. All right. So the back wings look decent. I like this front double. You do this. Now look good. This is the hard part of the breathing. The work's part. It's the hard part of the breathing. He won't understand. That was good. This is going to make me happy with what you feel about. I mean, it's four poses. Once you're peeled up, I would say, my best pose. We don't use. We should most muscular. If that's positive, the most muscular, I think front latins really good too. No, man. We can make that look really good. Chest up a little bit. You can make that up. I'm front double. I think you're classic front double, really nice. You might need to like, contort that left it back a little bit. Yeah. Nothing that was really good. This waste control get better. I can't believe it. Yeah. I don't know if it was the combination of the redder and the antidrawler what, but that's Friday. There's no way. I was just like, fuck this. No way. I can't do it. I can't do it. I got like through like, I got to 2700 that day. And I was like, it's 3 a.m. I'm going to blow my sleep cycle that I just reset. I better just go to bed. Yeah. And then the next. That also had a lot to do. You're appetite with all. So now, now I'm hungry on a load. And obviously on Friday, I skipped entirely because I missed my height. Yeah. So it's like, well, if I'm not, I'm not going to make myself less hungry. If I'm not hungry enough to eat my height, but they're hungry on your hungry on. That's good. I got through my 3700 on Monday, but it wasn't easy. So I was wondering, if I tried to tell you, job, if we did like 3,400 Monday, Wednesday, Friday, rather than doing 3700 on Monday and Friday. You think your handling value is going to help you that much? No. That's it. So that's why you hired me to tell them to shut up. Well, it's quite interesting. Like, you move pretty well, like with body fat, but your weight doesn't shift in time. Like you get leaner, but I also think you're re-compareding. It's because I'm so short, but they're re-compareding. 10 pounds on me is a lot. Now because I'm so short, I've kept your response well to the drugs. Well, because we brought me down. Yeah, that was pretty. Is that the first time that's happened in a while? I've never brought them down before a prep. Yeah. So now it's like we're adding drugs. It's just going to recap the whole time I'll price it the same way. It's a whole point. Well, I mean, yeah, then I would just stay too 12. I wouldn't have to go make way. We'll make one 77. Yeah. Right. She's her another one of these you want me to work on while we're here. No, the back double was one. That was a good one to look at. The front, the front double looks good, but honestly a lot of it's just going to be tweaking your weight. But it's hard to tell right now because you're just not mean enough yet. I could really push and forward like, yeah, you could do that. It's okay to cave your chest. You almost want to be like, bracing like someone's about to punch you the chest. Like if I were to do this, like what you would do with your shoulders, that's kind of what you want to do. But then you should like lose sick to get. But you need to, yeah, you need not that much. Yeah. That's kind of a heavy medium, but but that's kind of a nice view. Chest up a little bit more. There you go. That's good. All right. Great double. That perfect. You caught that left for the success. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. That's those two. Everything else can be such a nice shot. It's not a lot of fun. All of them. No, I think you'll be with the old boots before. Yeah. Yeah. This you just need to just up a little bit more. There you go. Well, if I lean up more, I lose the that's good. You want to keep your head back. All right. So don't lose your head. So just whatever it's comfortable to know about. And then the most muscular. You do the two hands together, right? Yeah. I can't wait if you look at those three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's my most opposed. And my worst pose is to say a tricep. You really? You think so? Yeah. I think this pose, like, well, it's really nice. I get to put that. Yeah. That's supposed to look really good, dude. All right. Well, then what is the most. You don't have a really bad pose. I think. I think it's my least favorite poses are my side tricep and my front lat. And you don't hate them. I don't hate them. Okay. We're good. Great news. I am now partnered with talent wellness.
