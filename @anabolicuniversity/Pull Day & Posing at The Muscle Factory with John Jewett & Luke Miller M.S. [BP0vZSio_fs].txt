You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV, where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. We're going to be training Paul with John Jewett and Luke Miller, and I'm just stretching to warm up because after that back workout I did with at the hunters gym, I tried to do too many machines and the rows fucked me up. So when I was in house games in Austin, I did pretty much all vertical pulling and no horizontal and my back didn't really get fucked up from it. So I pretty much have to limit myself to two sets of rows if I don't want to get hurt. And I'm what three or four days out, so even if I overdue it today, I'll recover in time for the show, but I won't sleep as well. Right now I'm preparing my battle me and I didn't drink all my Fenrist first. I don't know how long they trained for. So I don't want to get through the whole workout. I can always add water to this if I need to. But I don't want it like be bloated trying to shove Fenrist. Get 75% through the workout then put in the battle me. I'd rather get the battle me down board now. The glutamine is supposed to compete for absorption with the Argentine, but there's not a whole lot of Argentine. There's nitrosogen, which is super expensive, Argentine, but it's only like 1.5 grams because it's supposed to be 1.5 grams in nitrosogen. I think is equivalent to 6 grams of citron, but I still put in 11 grams of citron because I'd rather just throw money away than not have the best product on earth. So we're here at Muscle Factory in San Antonio, Texas with John Jewett and Luke Miller and we're going to hit back hamstrings and they're going to hit quads. I'm three days out so I'm not allowed to hit quads. Yeah, excited diving in the session, giving me some insights of what we're doing and just smash with Todd. Let's go, man. Right, you put your sister there and we were like, I'm like, ah, perfect. I have one in I first told you Tuesday they were like, oh shit, we're like filming, made it this for, we're out of the X-ray program. Yeah, I'm in the main one called Hourglass. So now it's just going to be heating wellness, but we shot that all yesterday. So it's glued, dealt caps, and lower lats. Pretty much just, just a lot of ass and legs and a little bit upper. Did some waist training stuff too. So I have a hard time feeling my white my laugh flat. I feel great. So if you see me different swimming jumping there, it's going to go second. Have you already been warming up? Yeah, I'll hop in there. I have to still tell you guys we go a lot heavier than I am. Let's see the other on Todd. This feels so much better. Yeah, you can see the difference. I do think your top position ruins your right side a bit. You're, let's try to get out too much. You get into like some internal rotation where you're delvelling. But I'm a laugh day stay, actually rotated. Yeah. Sorry, cool. Yeah, I feel this perfect. They love to start very like upright. So when you're already, you're already pull, you're having an arch to the lower back a lot. And we already takes a lot of a lot out of it. So we can, we can tweak it. We can tweak it. We're compensating. That's right. That's right. That's right. I tell people like, set up your back with the end in mind. So set it up already like how you want the finish point. So like if you want your finish point here, it's like, we'll set up your torso. So you're already in the right position. Because you're so far upright to, to make this level, you're having to do this. And so a lot's already in a poor position to work, right? So we're set up like ribcage down having this line of force lined up. It's like that's our, our end point from the movement. Now we just extend the arm up. Awesome. Because when you're at, you're kind of like, already here. Right. So to pull, I already kind of has to flare out. So I think starting with a good set up will, we'll start to solve some of the problem there. You go with it. Yeah, let me, I'll, I'll do care of this. I like on this one, it's cool because you lower the seat. You can change the pivot point. Okay. Right. So dropping it lower, it'll raise the pivot arm more and more and more. It loads really heavy heavier. I got it. So that's my way to change the arm. It's a little arm. But now starting positions here. Yeah. So my, my way to change the resistance profile. Yep. May or it's heavy as to the length and so like, you think loud, right? The lat only creatively tensioned using the ribcage. So with you were forward set up and then having to go into expansion, you were trying to shorten it here and then you're shortening it here. And so that's why you're losing it so much. And you compound that with the compensation of the arm flaring out. Think I'm worth the pee for no lat. Gosh. Yeah. I rewatched the, I play a hypertrophy module for this and for quads. One thing I like to do is, he was like, put this right leg all the way over. This line I could so far, it's like the right lines on here. So line the diverging lines. Me up just a little bit better. Feel the tension difference in the loading with sitting lower. Yeah. Way, way better. This looks like it might be a work way. You want to fill out the right set up before I go. I got you. It's too, so it can adjust the width. I know I'm not sure. So let's set you up at the bottom time. We'll pull you all the way down. Get in the right position, ribcage down. Get that out. Oh yeah, we're fired up. Now just let it out. And then hold that and don't lean as you go. This is a little, so I'll feel it. Whether you set you here. Yeah. Squeeze the elbow in. You're pitch down. There you go. It's tight. Let it out. Push that pinky towards the wall. There you go. There. Oh yeah, that's way better. Yeah, that's way better. I got to fill way harder too. Yeah. Yeah, that's so good, dude. There you go. Listen now. I think it's so much more in the area you don't work that I would, I would don't say on the side with that. Do one more set. We'll go lighter. Gage it. So this feels fine. I didn't argue that could be better. Oh yeah, that one's lit up. Yeah. So you're timing when you want me to start to work, Sats. Huh? You tell me when you want me to start to work, Sats. Sure. Yeah. Feel the difference in lighting and pull around the rage. Yeah, yes. No, the cue is like letting out like kind of letting that seem best. First shake is pushing it all up forward. Then coming off. And this side just does it automatically. Let's circle yeah, Oh yeah. That's why it's hurts, having fun, energy toe there you go What you're normal, a lot that you have at home in the machine you got. So in one place we got that, the plato, but it kind of the end range is up here. It's not well enough for me. I have to sit on like the open blocks. What I've been doing is I trained with Jeanette Kina in Los Angeles and he showed me how to use the cable to do some very similar. Okay, so I'll do pull ups first, neutral grip pull ups because I'm light enough to do on now and then I'll do two sets of these and then two sets of guide bridge and pull down. Okay, so I get six sets of lads and I'll do two sets of rows. So what do you want me to use in two? To feel this one out you want me to play in a quarter to really nail it? Okay, yeah. I think I could probably leave two on the left side because I feel that far. I know you're not supposed to do that, but switch the course, switch the torso back first and then start. I think I'll say I was, I would find the bottom. Pull. Yeah, it's turn up there, it's. Yeah, that felt great. I'm going to slide this first, right? That's it. That's good. Full weight, brother. All right, sure up to four and a half. Yeah, I'll go actually four and a 10 on there. Four and a 10. Oh, sorry. Yeah, good. See how it almost looks like as lad is like the writing is okay. It feels up like that's because this ain't, you got to start it to feel it and then you get better on it. You need to do the whole like start position thing. But that's what you're looking for. All of you, I'm going to pull it down. It is as late as any of the fiber around the stage with this being like the loading in order to do that. The lid part is the placing rather than arching the back. Absolutely. Yeah. You kind of quickly fall back into wanting to start leading forward, right? Yeah. But like keeping that like almost pushing the lower back out on that brace. I saw you guys doing that on the hack squat too. I think it's like that and like I put a semi roller behind my neck. Okay. So it's like curved on the one side and flat on the other. So like be a ramp for that. I used both hands to set up the torso right through the saw and then once it's locked in and stuff to the end down and go. Really can't find anything. That's not true. Oh. Oh. Shit. Oh. Oh. And. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. There you go. I got the. Oh. I got the. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I should have read the room. If you wanted help, John would have helped you bring one. It's all good, man. It's the first time training together. Yeah. I usually train alone. So I don't. We don't even bother spending. Yeah. I don't even think like it needs like added wraps and it's don't use a go for him anyway. So I think it can handle two plates. I may not get a same on the right as I do in the last. Oh. When I'm in that situation, let's say Matt just easily match the reps from what I do with the week arm. Yeah. The winner of the arch. Break that. Yeah. There he's. Okay. Now I feel it. Got it. Yep. Don't let the torso lean as you go. Hey. Hey. You said 12. Yeah. I will be done. I want to be counting it out. That's close. I'm really curious. Yeah. That's all right. Get theулant. That's all right. I'd appreciate it. Wake up. Yeah. You. You. Yeah. You. You. You. Yeah. So when you set it off here, as you go through the set, you slowly go like this in front leaning forward and then creating the rising extension to get back in your old habit. So you've got to learn to keep it. I almost coach it like push your ribcage back as you go up. Okay, so to get it away from the arm. Got it from the arm. No, I have to shake it and keep that lean back. So shuffin it? Yeah. So you feel like you're in here? Yes, it's all the time for years. So it's like you never figured out how to do it. So leaning back at the hip but not the thoracic, right? So you keep the abs contracted and you've been at the hip to get back straight here. Yeah. Versus being like this, right? Okay. So you have to have a brace at one point with the hips weren't too far in and then you back to where you're like, why the hell am I finishing here? So it ends here pelvic tilt when I should be posterior pelvic tilt. I don't even know you in the tilt, right? It's a hip hand shell. Yeah. So like course braced here, all you need to do is just a lean back. So now you're finished because you're like kind of start drifting forward than having then to arch right. So if you're braced and you're finishing here, all you need to do to fix it is lean back. So now you can finish it all the way. Make sense? Your last update, you were 248. Yeah. You probably joined a shot with all this teaching crap like I'm three days out, man. No, I look. Because I've been, you've been a huge day sharp. I mean, there are like three days out or seven days out for the whole month. So as soon as I step off, the stage of seven days out. So I'm like, I don't give you shit. Yeah, when should I train legs? Oh, yeah. Taking my thought. King that. King. King. Super heavyweight and we ready for the next episode. What do you think, huh? She went a half or you want to go back up. I wouldn't go up in load, especially you do. Considering work for where you at, I don't know for, I'm going to give it to the Rubskilled Nath. So, it's worth just set up for a skip the hips in farther. Now, lean, not that far too far in. Okay. There. Now, just lean at the hip. It's good you set up here. You go to hip, hip, send a little more. There you go. Now, lean back. Now, push it down. There you go. And let it go. There you go. Get a lower beat. There are lots of them far. It is. Oh yeah. You're doing it down here. Wow. That's it. Which by upwards you have to forward the whole time? Two of those last like three. Okay. Three is better than twelve. You're doing it down here. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. that just keep it in context right with EMG doesn't always relate to development outcomes. That wasn't a, well we're talking about it. We weren't, we weren't. We're easily, it's a chasing way to the bar, chasing a stimulus in the muscle. But when I was still body running, I was really strong and I would kind of let that drive me. It's a great piece. It's fucking the bottom. Excuse me, man. No customer love. I was like, out shopping at F1's on your show and I was like, they were so clean. Hopefully they had it to sell out my watch to final cut. That was like, that's the owner right there. So if he tells you he'd put it. Oh, is that rolling? Nice to meet you guys. I don't want to bother you. I'm too big. So I get more laughs if I just stay here. I didn't tell you how we're doing here. So, sorry I own fault. I just kind of touched it to make sure I'm not going to break. I'm holding it down. I find if I don't collapse the spine, I can keep it on the lats a lot better. Makes sense right? That we're talking about keeping the right cage expanded open. Smoney, I do it over here, but not over there. It seems you're doing the horizontal plan that isn't very cool. I've noticed that. You think three in the top? Huh? There's some reason I thought you guys loaded five. You'd go two here and two and four. One, so. It normally load middle. Here. But you see how we do here and here. But they can't even fit them on so they can't fit. They don't fit. I didn't think of that. So the selling, I set this one up. It's really like arching back. I am driving like pelvis down so you see my lower back in neutral. That's my star position. And I just use the pad as I roll back. I'm pushing into the pad as I roll. So it's seen here. Using your abdomen and not your sternum on the pad. It's kind of a row. What ever sits on the pad for you? Well, the idea of not pulling off of it is the idea of it. Other things handles, drive them down. And then scrape them against the ground as you come back. Let's get the lats. And that'll do a lot of lot. You'll end up finishing like right here. Well, you're finishing back here. I was. It's starting to move into upper back. Which you absolutely feel like lads off the bottom. I'm sure you did. Oh yeah. No, I know exactly. I like to do it the way you're talking about. I don't know why I didn't do it. I always feel like you're cheating when you do it that way. Even though you're getting better, lads are all there. I mean, it's so hard to set up the back stuff. Okay, yeah. It's really, they don't pass them then line it all. Whoops, sorry, buddy. And we're out at about a 45 degree angle. That's probably because this triceps is slats. It's just what it's got. Well, I said this, it happened to be seeing a warm for me to get there. So it's kind of like more, it's some lads going to be a little bit bad. Yeah. I'm going to do two and one. I just want to do it like solid like I know. I didn't watch you in the quarter. Yeah. All right. Like for us, this is going to work out for a little bit more lap for loop. You're like, you would need something wider. I'm purposely pushing out on these handles to try to align it. What is your goal right now? If it was chest and quad last gear, chest, chest, chest, chest main priority. Tail, baby. Delta can always use more of too. But how many days does it take? Because it seems like my delts are sore in the moment. And they're completely recovered the next day. I could train them probably easily. I could probably run them every day. Honestly, I don't move it without any problems. Three sets of delts every day, I'd be fine. Yeah. Do you want me here? And that's it. Oh, just scrape the ground with them. Yeah, too. It was pretty hard. Yeah, they're controlling the bottom. You said it was good. Don't change it. Locking right there, yeah? You're pushing the end, right? You're pushing the end, right? You use less weight. You get more stimulus. How old are you? 46. Yeah. About a few four and two. You need to survive with these weights, right? Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. I'm going to die, you're just catching nothing. Yeah. You're making a difference, man. Yeah. You're going to fly through. Yeah, you're just doing nothing. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it, man. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Just like the shoulder go, don't flex over the chest pad. That's it, yep. What's better? It's better. I'm going to tune one up there, but I'll let you know. I need to change this for me. I'm going to do my thing. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to grab some blocks. There you go. Very nice. I'm going to do it. There you go. I'm going to do it. I'm not a fan. I think for most people they don't have the rotation to keep it in a lot. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can do it. I don't really see the utility. I got to go for you. It was pretty good. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. It was very smooth. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm going to do it. I do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
