You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. All right, everyone. We got Sam Pierce again for part two. We're going to discuss training and nutrition of this IFBB Pro one the amateur Olympia. So I use back. What is I would assume what you do now is different from what you did before. So why don't you contrast for us what the training was like would put the muscle on versus what you're doing now and if you think it's I mean I would assume if you're doing something different now you it's because you think it works better. That's a good question man and I think that just comes with aging and maturing right man. I was always strong. I've always coached power with the strong men things like that. Not necessarily programming wise but I've always respect to me because you know when I was training the gym and putting up a social meeting you your barbell squatting six plates for eight reps. My best of that of deadlifted seven plates four reps bench pressing four plates will six to eight reps things like that. You know you're doing all these crazy numbers in the gym and over time you're injured for more of the year than what you are training right even though I was you know inclined pressing I'm trying to work it in pounds with 70 kilos so I'm inclined pressing you know the what 160 170 pound dumbbells reps but then you get Australian your pack and you kind of train it that's one of my fuel my packs a week because there's been behind this whole time because I had strong shoulders strong trussets right so you know people say the foundation of the muscle came out because obviously we're training heavy we're training free weight based newman like you know I used to watch for any common pre-workout I'm sure you used to as well but at the end of the day man if I was training like I am now considering I'm probably double the size of water's back then would have greater effects it's kind of a total of questions right I think the other thing too is that you kind of need to have that mungle right you need to have that initial stage of training hard heavy and kind of careless in your 20s where my form was always good but learning how to actually put the load onto the muscle was a big factor for me and this is where you know you know you kind of you know you got asked if those questions because you don't have that mungle in you you're not going to train as hard as what you are training now you have to learn how to have that kind of mungle that aggression that I can do that kind of careless factor and then put all that into and compartmentalise it into your action training where you are mungle but you're now actually using that to progressively train the right way does that make sense? So back then you know just the typical broce split you know you're just training you know you're doing lots of all you're training hard you know just doing what you're going to do until the session's kind of done and you're walking out spent but I wouldn't say the muscle was spent so age catches up with your man you know like late 20s started to carry those you know minor pectures and things like that and I just kind of got sick of it I had to come back and just train properly and that really just comes down and drop in the ego I tell you one dude who I really really look at for training now I think he trains the best out of anyone on the pro circuit is Nick Walker okay because you watch his old videos man he's strong as it knocks you know then you watch and train in the efficiency we have he trains people say oh yeah you know he trains light or whatever it is like no you can see they're connected they keep the mind loss of connections to what he's actually hitting and looking to progress the overload that way that's the biggest factor make I find the whole progressive overload thing which I got caught up with you're trying to progress every week on numbers you're trying to progress every week on load where progressions still comes in the fact where you're sitting there and going you know can you do a better set the following week you know can you get more because that's still strength maybe hitting something per say 12 reps and you're going to pay me but that 11 12 was just a bit off like do you really have to go up or would you look to get that's what we're getting the following week and do it just better I still think that's progressive overload if my 12th rep is not as good as my first rep then I'll put 11 plus one yeah so I got 11 reps and I failed on the 12th rep because if it isn't perfect you failed correct correct and that's that's the biggest problem I had coming up as a young guy so people think obviously I put stuff out for rage mate on my social media but people get so caught up with me saying you know don't get past you know you know don't train to five reps or six reps and they come back and say oh you know the final five reps for full failure that's the biggest part it's like yeah look it is the biggest part right but you guys miss the point of what I'm trying to say here you know we're talking about five quality reps before you fail what did they look like you know those five shitty reps that you're doing or like a lot of the time for myself like if I had a program it'd be probably when I first started and I have a with a lot of clients is that you put say 10 reps on a program and they stop at 10 where it's like yeah you stop at 10 well you probably could have kept going you know just because about aiming for a number I find that when I come back and people show them their love books or their show you know what I have in their apps and they're getting these like kind of equal numbers you know so if you say three sets of 10 and they're getting 10 10 10 10 10 and they're getting a four shit you know you're doing you're doing you're doing two sets of eight eight eight eight to me it's like I find if you're gonna fail perfectly for all those reps and all those sets it's kind of like winning the lottery right it's so hard to for me even now if I was to pick a workout and pick the number so I could actually fail on those reps for all those sets given I think I think it's more like impossible to do it's like it's like kind of yeah it's it's a lack of the draw because really if I hit something really good in my first exercise that actually might contradicts my next exercise and and for TV other it as well right so this is where people kind of get caught up on the whole numbers thing and they forget to apply common sense to that aspect I mean I'm not never how should I put this I'm always disappointed with people's intelligence and judgment so I don't know what I look at these people's logbook if they're even smart enough to fill out a logbook they usually either train like assholes or they train like posses it's like three sets of 12 so they it's a deadlift so they gotta do four reps to failure and they hurt themselves it's training like an asshole you're 50 years old you don't have any chance of ever doing powerlifting why the fuck are you doing Russian deadlifts for four reps when you're supposed to be doing Romanian in the for 12 and it's like okay well I have to take deadlifts off your program because you're not mature enough to have deadlifts on your program and then it's like or you see this with women and some men well it'd be like four sets of 15 15 15 15 15 15 and it's like week after week after week yes like they're they have they're always getting all the reps and you're like dude what the fuck like if you're failing how are you failing exactly on 15 the third set on every exercise every week yes and they're like I don't know I just do and it's like okay no you don't you're not failing or you're doing extra you're doing beyond failure sets you're doing rest-pods or you're doing partials to try to squeeze up to 15 and the way you know the differences if they're never sore and they're not hurt that means that they're nowhere close to failure if they've got if they've got this massive tenonitis they haven't told you about until the point where they can't hold a pencil and it's like okay so you've been building up this tenonitis for six months and you never told me you've been having tenonitis and now you have to stop doing upper body for six months for the tenonitis to go on here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I've been yeah it's like I'm just laughing because that was me when I was younger as well you know we have to all laugh or I we they're stupid shit we don't know younger but it's a sad thing man it's like I wouldn't get to your old man I wouldn't get angry at someone if they came to me and I know I say I do know they're trying hard and they feel disappointed themselves they'll say to be oh look man I'm you know I did a set of leg the second set of leg press you know he's a third tenon the first mine I I gasped out of eight on the second and honestly I just I couldn't hit the third I'm sorry for being a pussy I'm like were you really being a pussy or was that actually kind of seeing that going that's that's quite smart because you know when you kind of dipping out and failing to that point especially in something like a late press or a squatting pattern or a delifty pattern I say or my say will do that's actually a good thing for me because one the the risk of the rest of the reward of injury is not worth it that's the first thing but too it just says you're training hard like it to me like if someone knows how to train like hard okay which nine and I'm certain people don't then it's easy it's what's easy to scale them back and try to actually work with a pussy that's trying to you know you're trying to get them to push harder in the gym so you finally get that you go you're going to kind of mix it both you know but yeah this is the problem because the people that have that kind of sweet spot where they train so effective and well it's very rare they're going to kind of come in and say oh yeah okay that third said it's it's the people who are used to the train like an asshole they're just coming and say okay well you know I only got eight reps I spent the year twelve but I'll still go ahead of you anywhere it's like fucking what the head you know I hate that they get they're supposed to do like 15 to 20 in the leg press and they get 13 and instead of backing off the weight they either do the same weight or the ad way this look the fuck are you doing taught I'm going to stop you you're supposed to get stop you there this is good you just got me something what do you say to people then the fatigue demons because you just said 15 and 20 reps on a leg press and the big talk on Instagram at the moment is if you do anything over six you know it's class is cardio too much fatigue you know like you're the job so what's yeah what's going on here man you're doing it wrong you're programming with their children when they're 20 year old children and the their fucking six rep maxes seven is three plates on the leg press fuck yeah do six plates you're not going to hurt yourself you're a bitch but if you're doing a thousand pounds for 20 reps like and your feet hurt fuck your legs fuck your knees fuck your lower back your feet hurt your feet are separating over time your your feet are double E what width because you've been leg pressing for 20 years then we can't make it heavier you can only put more reps on it but once your one-year durability is exceeded by the load you have to do more reps and that's what I hate about these idiots is that they look at the pro bodybuilders and they're like oh he's doing too much volume he's doing too many reps it's like you're doing 15 reps on the leg curl because if you do 12 reps you're going to tear your knee apart we'll look on his ear. He's sheering force behind your knee over 170 pounds you have to just do 160 pounds for as many reps as you can see that's it man if that's not enough stimulus and two sets like two sets of age would do it but you need like four sets of 15 like then you do four sets of 15 but you can't go heavier. correct that's how it's all my quadrucian start with you. January and the problem is that even for myself you know I've got the video I post on mine and you know I show I show you I show you around the table because I had perfect form it was my second last set before my max you know so funny enough what was going from my head I did the first rep and I look I'll just I'll bag out of I'll bang out 10 and I'll go up next set you know and I'll actually just easing back into the program and first rep down second rep bang need full across my leg the lateral thermo quad tour grade two tear almost a grade three and yeah man like because he's a thing when I tell people I'm like oh yeah if I can still wasn't if my heavier set it wasn't going from my max loading you know I was trying to be conservative but dude there was there was still still six plates on the hat squat you know I mean like that's it's still what I'll wait to you know and even I forget that I'm like yeah look it was it was I'll still feel in good that day there was nothing wrong but at the end of the day six plates is still six plates you can't just you know even for myself that's probably what three of you know probably I'm not afraid that extra five percent that I should have or you know I can't remember what I'll see here that's why I'm not really does but then the questions you are actually still because I'm like yeah I probably still took six plates for a gradient you know what I mean so coming back into it now like I'm really coming into a place of my training which comes to the second part of your question how do I train now this is the best I train legs and the best my physique has ever been now and I'm only working up to a three plate hat squat I three plate three plate front squat you know just just working through movements that I really connect with and just making sure the movements I'm just practicing and getting better and better like Todd here's the thing right with training the word training if you were to go work in adults right you have a day of training you're going to train and and and learn what the systems are and things like that that's what people also forget what training of course we're trying to get there a kick out and you know and and go ball to the wall but we're training for something we need to have a purpose to train which to me is still learning the skill of making the movement better getting more out of the mood and you know and that that's the skill on its own man and it took me for that quad to earlier the year to realize that to have the appreciation one for training so it's like holy shit like literally one rev and other macarure is over my god grade you know I've just had this mad off season with John you know with killed the off season everything's great we just had a break over christian so I can give it to these but I wasn't even pissed off I just said oh great that's been my bodybuilding career I was lucky enough that the tear went up the ladder of the head actually made by a quad look better so I was happy with that but you know at that given time I just you know you just take that appreciation for training you say you know what like I realize now that even not I'd be on your head you said you can still get you know injured fucking badly and now the fact that there's old videos of me training that you know where I'm barbell squatting six plates asked to grass I'm coming up and I'm shaking like on the on the six you know I got my spot or there he's like oh another one and you just like I'm and you're already used to thinking my head man I used to thinking my head I still remember this said it was my PB of barbell squats it was New Year's Day 2000 and 19 I was getting ready for my second Arnold's pro share in Australia and I still remember it was New Year's New Year's morning six A.M. or training legs and the six rep I came up and Shats and Michael Lucia if he's watching us he was my training part of the song and he said to me he goes hit another one and I remember I said to myself you know what I said I said I'm gonna blow an air fuck it that's what I said man I said it in my head I didn't say that loud but I in my head I'm like I came up and that's when I got goosebumps talking about it and yeah and I'm coming up again and you know he's like he's like oh another one you know he trains fucking crazy and and at the same thing I thought of like if you blow out a meat fuck it just do what you do it you know and I managed to get it up and the cool story to tell and I get goosebumps because I'm like oh I missed those days but at the same time I cringe just as much. Sounds scary yeah the way I look at it is if the velocity is less on that wrap it's safer to rack it and do another set yeah in a few minutes that it is to just squeeze out one or two reps because unless you use your numbers six plates your 300 pounds so that's 840 pounds plus the sled so that's like a thousand pounds at a 45 degree angle the coast I know 45 is 0.5 so it's about 500 pounds of work. Put them so you do 500 pounds of work for 10 reps you could rack it or you could squeeze out two potentially more reps but if you squeeze out two more reps and get 12 reps with 500 pounds you're next set you'll get like six so that's 18 reps but if you did 10 reps with two in the tank you could come back and do 10 more reps and you'd be one in the tank and then if five minutes later do another set and be 10 reps on failure so you could get 30 reps or you could get 18 reps with the same 500 pounds and well well look there's no logic to doing it the macho way looks more it's better to do it the discipline way it's better for Instagram but yeah as if it's actually building cause everything in my body knows to watch the size of water was back then even in those videos I'm telling you about right um it's the riskless reward right but here's the other thing too you like this is where I say I don't regret those days I was lucky I'm so lucky I got out of there not injured um those days are very certain like that um but those days are so they taught me how to train hard because learning how to train hard in that way I'm still thankful for it because now they have maturity behind me I do actually know what two reps and reserve is because there's a lot of guys as well that preach on the other side and they say you know reps and reserve all day long but it's like that how do you know what your reps and reserve are if you've never kind of pushed to that failing point as well right so I'm not telling anyone who's watching this video to your faces what I did because like trust me I cringe talking about it right these are more horror stories but yeah I think as I said we're gonna have that kind of um that makes the both you know if you're young you know you're over us whatever you know I still think starting off when you're young learning the basic compounds and learning free weights and things like that first so you can understand your stability control and you know what the weight feels like and pushing those reps whatever it is again disclaimer I'm not telling anyone to do how I train but yeah just you know as I said learning to kind of go to that point of failure safely and then then you're able to utilize these much better movements you know and Todd think about it too right just going back on those horror stories where you used to train you know crazy and suited back in the day um even on a marble squad right even if I did stop at that six wrap that I'll tell you about before I got those two you know that just went out worth it and even for those six pressure four it would have just been better to do a hacks for them would have been dual marble squad because you would have a far more stimulus through the quads you know when I was doing all those heavy movements that's because I'm I'm a rectid dominant and and glutes dominant you know so really those movements that are really carried by all this deadlifting movements and everything that they're without carried by those those muscles therefore I was actually weaker through the quads even though I could squat a truck right when I found it was I used to be able to Smith squad 500 pounds for like eight wraps four play five play three reps yeah and I could leg extension maybe a hundred pounds single leg for 20 reps and I could leg curl on a particular machine 140 for 12 reps all right or another one I could leg curl like a hundred and thirty pounds for like 12 reps and now I can leg extension 140 for 20 reps one leg I can leg curl 170 for 12 reps but when I tried to do a Smith quad for the first time in two years I could I was struggling with two plates and then within minutes of doing the Smith quads my glutes were sore I didn't feel shit in my quads so and that was my second time doing legs that day so what I figured was my goal which was to avoid actually loaded pressing through the heels worked and that my glutes got smaller my adductors are actually a little smaller my quads are the same size are even bigger now my hamsters are definitely bigger now so my legs look better from the side they look worse from the front in the sense that they look less big but they have a better shape to them yeah okay now as I progress in the strength I think that my legs are going to get even better in shape but I'll never get those glutes back and I'll never have big adductors and that's fine because I all the adduction machine in the world is not going to make up then build your adductors as much as like four or five hundred pounds squat yeah yeah yeah but if I can bring my waist in one inch just one inch that's going to bring my shoulder make my shoulders look two inches bigger my arms look in or two inches bigger how are you bringing your waist through well just not doing heavy shit no more hip hinges no more squatting of any sort so like I'll do hacksquots with my heels elevated and that's the most squatty thing I'll do about squat with my heels elevated leg press with the heels elevated everything's focused I'm getting as much heel elevations possible so it's as much quad as possible so then bringing the waist to sorry sorry keep going my most recent training video which the five week out just drop but the four week out one let's film three or four days ago that's probably one of my best leg training videos because I've incorporated the material I learned from Genekki and it took me a couple weeks to master or what I think is master to be a coefficient we'll say with some of the adjustments he made to my leg training but in that video I've been doing it long enough to where I think I'm demonstrating it enough or well enough to reconcie how much more efficient and effective that type of training is with these little adjustments like the pad behind the knee and the leg extension the pad under the knee and the leg curl line like your your feet up on a semi roller not a full full roller but a three inch diameter semi roller on the hacksquot and on the belt squat and I'm able to target my quads so much better and leg curl spiel line leg curl spiel so much better on the hamstrings now and although I'm not even using last weight so that was one concern is every time you pick a more disadvantaged way of training a muscle you're using even last weight so in the back of your mind you're always worried like is it really about load and torque on the muscle or is there something you said just for mass of load and in this case my loads didn't really go down it's just that there's more torque on the target muscle and even less amount of glutes involved yeah so they're moving into say like waist control things like that no you know free weight work obviously he's injured all that kind of stuff what's your view then coming starting that in with abs training vacuum training wearing a bell white's training those even food tops what's your what's your opinion on that all that matters prioritization it's target one would be making sure you have no gas no indigestion and then if you're using a glp one agonist you don't want to have enough that you have gastropereesis that's number one digestive enzymes probiotics all that's okay so don't make the problem worse so an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and then so not doing axly loaded shit and not causing gas or abdominal distension would be priorities one and two priority three would be vacuum training directly training the transversive dominance and then four would be doing it rectus abdominal is training that uses the transversive dominance such as an ab roller or in theory planks those are the things that I saw the greatest improvement in my waist control is planks ab rollers vacuums and having no gas no indigestion yeah how do you because I agree exactly on that I'm just asking you questions that coming my head that I get all the time because I I notice that myself you know if I go and have a treat meal or whatever it is just the next day alone you know in the morning I just feel it you know like oh you know it's just there because even just foreign foods make like even it doesn't even have to be I don't really eat dirty when I have a treat meal anyway but just foreign foods you're not sticking to within your routine I find can can have play havoc on that right but yeah we can we can both agree on that now what were was going to with that I just lost my chance for a movie trailer jacket when you eat out you're gonna get restaurants that all of they should be using olive oil because they're Mediterranean restaurants they're still using poly hydrogenated vegetable oil and other things that are not digestible so I don't like eating out if I do eat out I eat sushi because if I just so quickly if I want a cheap meal I can cook for and then I can make it better and better macros and I can fine tune it so that I digest it well and to facilitate the digestion you can always take digestive enzymes with your food yeah so what about wearing like a like a bracing belt or um okay I'm the white strand of when you when you're training a gym I think the the reason why I lost my my lower is because whereas for years like 10 years I didn't wear a belt when I trained my lats because I would lose my muscle connection with them I started to and I lost my lats my lower lats just ceased to exist and so Dominic who's my coach suggests that took the belt off when I trained back and I'm getting better my muscle connection with my lower lats there's sword of peaking out now when I do poses I wear the belt on all other body parts very interesting and that way I'm subconsciously if I was to real and I feel uncomfortable not wearing it because I don't feel like my abs are always in a kind of constant state of tightness like it doesn't need to be as tight as possible but it because then that you've got that spilling over the top of the belt but I put it around my navel and I try to keep my abs tight like I'm in a mini vacuum all the time there it is when I wear that belt there it is that's it that's what I was looking for so when I was younger and trained here used to wear a belt because you see all the battle for the limpia divides all the boys wearing it and when I was training in in the gym in some of it was sick because you can do it so tight but yeah like it's like you don't because people say I was at a GH got us like no it's just so tight over the top like your stomach has to go somewhere right we're now in these days I kind of sit there and I use it as like a reminder for myself that when I have it on even if you have your enemy but you can still spill out right so just remind you just keep it tight locked and brace the whole time because when you're in those deep states and breathing especially like between sets that's where you get that bad shot but someone takes you I throw it all the one stays and you breathe it out you know so I think off-season especially in the off-season because pre-sins a bit easier because you're coming down anyway but especially the off-season I think it's so important for all these protocols for you know you're abtraining you know probably dodging foods and then obviously using abrasion some sort to just help you to remind yourself to keep yourself bulk rates through the abdominal region and also between sets as well. What I found was for years they did a waste trainer and if I would wear the belt over the waste trainer to distribute the force evenly through the metal rods so that the belt didn't squeeze a small surface area it ended up distributing a force over larger surface area one thing that does not work is lifting with the waste trainer on because when you go to brace it just destroys the rice trainer so if you're going to use a waste trainer it should be as a tool to enhance the belt but you don't need it the belt is what you need to be able to keep your waste tight and that if you do brace against the belt at least you're bracing against the belt your which circumference of your waist is not expand. It's refreshing to hear someone actually talking about you know the fundamentals of body doing yeah because it really sounds like with yourself because I don't think speak for myself really training now to the fact and bring up the body parts needed you know because we get so I just get so caught up on all you have to do be heavy based lots of dead lives or whatever it is but it's learning how to kind of channel all that force into the right area like for example someone say how can you wear a back brace or you know a weight belt for training but you don't wear it for back but when you wear it for back where it's like well know as you said your everything is I would assume probably assisted now just supported or some sort where you can really target and isolate those areas but again you have to know how to train hard and effective to make it to work regardless because that's where people get so confused on hobby have to barbell row and you have to do this it's like well if you're still training like shit you're still trying like a pussy a barbell row is fucking just as useless as what a just support a TV I would be right I mean I did have a huge back when I did bent rows because I was up to 400 pounds but I only felt my lower back I almost never felt my lats and if I did feel my lats it was my upper lats and it's like if you were if I was going to do a bent row here this is a really complicated concept but a bent row is a poor man seated cable row and let me explain why okay so we have gravity acting on the bar right so let's say the bar is 200 pounds now you're bent over so gravity is acting on your upper body so now your lower back is doing the load of your upper body weight which is 60% of your total body weight and the barbell okay so if you're 300 pounds that means that you're and you're bent rowing 200 pounds you're basically your lower back's taking the load of 380 pounds but your upper back is only getting the load of 200 pounds so your lower back is going to fail before your upper back even your lats now if you were to sit down and sit upright now your lower back is taking no additional load there's 200 pounds on the cable so your upper back is going to be rowing 200 pounds and your lower back is going to be asymmetrically supporting that same 200 pounds so your lower back has no reason to fail before your upper back in less it's weak especially in no circumstance yeah if you have a belt on because when you have that belt on and then you go to bend over for the barbell row you're going to completely forget about racing the abdominal region as well because you're just trying to survive right you're not going to think oh yeah I've got to do this and it's cute you're just trying to not break your back that's your main priority so now all that excess force coming over the belt where when you go into a set of cable road now you actually remember you remind us of that if I'm going to pull this back as we know the further back we get our elbows you know we got to have a deep contraction given on the power show I work about back but just saying we're trying to work maybe so out of back when you're pulling through if you're not racing your abs and the bar is going to hit the top of your abs because it's sitting over the top rod so you actually have to have a brace properly so you can get a further range of motion as well so this is another beautiful thing about the seated cable row by using the seated cable row you can use different handles so you can properly target the lads where you cannot do that with a barbell you can target your rambulite you can target your rear delts you can target your upper traps you can target anything with the seated cable row you can't do shit with a bento with a barbell row now people say well you can use a lot more weight if you were to properly stretch out all the way you would not be bent rowing 400 pounds you'd maybe bet if you were to stand on a box and stretch it all the way and try to touch the floor where barbell's beyond your feet you'd be bent rowing half or a quarter as much as you could if you're doing a durian row so the seated cable row with that big flex the way Arnold does his pumping iron is what Mike is retail calls a flexion row and I find that if you do a flexion row where you're like this and that and you're really getting the full articulation of your back from your hips all the way up to the back of your skull you're contracting every muscle in your upper back that is a great finisher the seated cable row for a back workout because it's going to be all the lower back you need it's going to finish off your lats and it's going to incorporate your rhomboids and upper traps and this is of course a non-shroth supported row but if what look here's a good model is a vertical row I'm going to vertical pull down the single arm to target the lower lat right then a vertical row bilateral to hit your upper lats a little bit of rhomboids, weird downs then some type of chess supported row to work your upper back with the maximum on a low possible then you've finished with the seated cable row so that your upper back should ready pre-feteed so your lower back won't be the failing force but your lower back still will get work if you do a really really deep stretch you'll get a hamstring stretch a glute stretch a lower back stretch and then you're going to try to contract your scapula first drive your hands and elbows down to it gauge your lats and then stick your chest up as high as it'll go so your rhomboids finish the motion and the bar should end somewhere about sternum level maybe lower sternum level you got pretty much the same back work it as many down here and I don't do that every day because I mean if I'm doing back three times a week it's gonna be slightly different and it's time otherwise you're gonna get stale really quick you're gonna have over use tenonitis and one joint like right now I've got some tenonitis right here and so I have to change to which teams up a lot so that I don't because I've been doing the same exercises too much but then it it sounds like you're a big fan of frequency then yeah I'm doing I was doing upper lower upper lower upper lower off but I got better results with upper lower off upper lower off which is what summer felt and Terran stood so to this home stretch because I kind of have my schedule locked into a seven day week I'm gonna go upper lower off upper lower upper okay since lats as the biggest priority then arms then quads legs because I feel like my legs are a lot smaller this year than they were last year on stage but they also are a lot leaner but in my head when I was doing every 48-hour leg training they were recovered fine four sets of quads four sets of hamstrings three sets of hamstrings every 48 hours recovered fine once I trained with jenekian started learning his techniques then when I came back at 72 hours I needed a recover so I can get so I'm only gonna be able to train legs twice a week now if I can handle four and four I'll go to five and five if I can handle five and five I'll go to six and six yeah by the time I'm up to six and six two times six is the same as three times four you know and at that point maybe I could roll it back to three times four and go add back in the third leg day but by that point I mean that's already gonna put me past the first show yeah I figure it's gonna be the period between the three shows is a no man's land you're just basically you're gonna get workouts in when you can and you're gonna perform as best you can and probably the volume's gonna be very low and you're gonna be all right so cardio right because I'm gonna drive down to florida then I'm gonna drive to Texas then I'm gonna compete in Texas drive back to Florida competing florida drive up to Arkansas and then drive up to back to Detroit to start prep for the February trip bro yeah I definitely think I'm with you I think the frequency matter is a major thing now you know being sore for four or five days or sore for the whole week picking that that was like a killer workout to me just makes no sense you know it's like you try training to get sore over time where you know you need to be affected with the new training and then try and train it again as quick as possible I think I think that's always the best way to go about things I find that yeah in the past yeah you know hitting that once a week whatever it is like you know the typical bro split I think those days are kind of kind of gone now to be honest and one thing I'll always preach not just myself but for everyone else you know like if you got a body part you want to bring it up yeah hit it hit it multiple times a week that don't be getting 20 sets in a work yeah then trying to expect you to get a training to boss up again it's 20 sets too. I was late because it's just not gonna happen yeah I was worked but I was doing eight sets of back three times a week I was fine when I went up to nine sets of back three times a week it kind of shipped a bed so I like six sets of lats two sets of upper back three times a week people like that's how I'm gonna fall for back it it six sets up a batch you do you do six sets up a bag you know like it's a little bit different when you put it in perspective so if you're doing a vertical unilateral vertical bilateral horizontal horizontal horizontal upper back focused that's six lats and two upper back then I have chest then I've got delts and then I throw in an extra by something so I'm the chest I'll do two sets of fly from one set of two sets like this so it's mostly chest and then two sets and close so it's more triceps so I'm technically getting two sets of triceps yeah yeah yeah on the upper day so that's six sets a week of triceps and at the end I'm gonna throw in a little bit of a bazen curls on upper so I get three sets of biceps because I dropped one of my arm days and then on my arms legs I do six sets of triceps and then I do the legs so I'll be getting a total of six six on the arm days 12 sets of biceps and triceps and then on the upper body days I'm gonna be getting three and two so I'm gonna be getting 18 sets of triceps and I'm gonna be getting 21 sets of biceps so basically I'm hitting arm five times a week that's why with so then by the chance of things as well you would have to prioritize obviously some areas and because again you're your training styles very similar to what what I preach right so I would look at something like that and I would say well something's gonna give for I don't know I just gonna be the gym all day and you're trying to battle for tea so how would someone like you work shoulders there so what I do is because shoulders with my bass body part they're at the end of the upper body workout so I'd three sets of lateral machine I do the lateral machine but I do it unilaterally because it allows me I don't like doing bilateral stuff usually because I can isolate the each individual heads different if you try to work both middle doubts at the same time I get a lot of traps if I try to work one middle doubt at a time but you find that with actually all small muscle groups like say biceps trusset and shoulders you get a better connection hitting them unilaterally anyway because by the sounds of it obviously I find with biceps for example when you're hitting them biolaterally I find when you're fatigued towards a session as well you know you can get it into your delcumming in what you just mentioned then I find you know what you're hitting biolateral side raises or all you know hitting something in posterior posterior delcumming a lot of traps you take over and a lot of people kind of understand that you know that's why I say I think it's it's not going to cause anyone here is much fatigue and you're going to get a far better connection especially later on the work you have made well when you're later on the work you're tired you've done your you're being heavy lifts top thing I think to have that kind of focus is just to come in and take some between the side as well and really sharpen up on hitting and your intention for what you need out of those single arm movements yeah I mean I've always prefer to try a substitute lateral in less it's a press and almost always my presses are a blend of upper chest and yeah yeah yeah I never isolate my chest on a press if I want to isolate my chest I'll use a fly yeah all right because my biggest weakness is would be lower lats try-seps quad sweep those would be a b and c so I basically I start my upper body days with lats and then I start my other arms and leg days with triceps because those are priorities one and two and then I on the legs I used to do hamstrings add doctors quads that was a disservice to my quads now what I'm going to do is hamstrings quads hamstrings quads add doctors calves it works much better I'm getting way better yeah this way and it's not like pumps are relevant when you're 180 pounds on a hundred carbs or 150 carbs a day like fuck pumps like that ain't happened and so yeah there's no reason to do all of the muscle in a row it makes more sense to break it up like tricep bicep tricep bicep hamstrings quad hamstrings quad and then with with back versus chest my chest one of my best body parts my lats are terrible it's six sets of lats two sets of upper back two sets of three sets of rear delts then two sets of fly two sets of wide press two sets of narrow press then three sets of middle delts that I'll finish off with a little bit of bicep work just to get extra volume for bicep since my biceps don't get sore but see this is where I say as well the reason I think you do that correct me if I'm wrong but this is why I do the same thing is here is because when you hit say you have the quad ham or the or the bicep tricep and you're keeping the blood in the area anyway you know even if you're in the offseason like bed the blood suit in the area you're not going to lose the pump out of it right it's just giving yourself that little bit of extra rest as well to connect back with the muscle that when people say I can be trained back all as one then and not chest and back because the way I program back would be you know say upper back lower lats upper back lower lats or lower lats lower lats lower that's upper back like you still giving yourself that kind of break in between as well with those muscle groups it's still keeping all the blood the same area so I found that when you're using say all hamstrings and doctors first as their weak muscle group for myself you want to go in and and blast the shit out of them but yeah it is a disservice to your quads and I'll also find as well when you are trying to train heavy through those squatting patterns and leg pressure patterns this stability is also a bit off like I find there's a kind of diminishing return where I think hamstring curls for example are a great way to warm up the knees but if you're coming in and blasts and hamstrings too you know they're falling off the baron top thing and then you try to squat and and do like I said the loft it is very hard to kind of connect and stabilize yourself to a point way I know what's trying to pre-futate the muscle to a certain extent then also going to far down the lawn to take away if we're actually trying to do which I still believe you need to train heavy to some extent and the reason I used to do add doctors before quads is I was dealing with so much weight that if I didn't warm up the add doctors I would risk tearing them or grabbing but now that I'm super isolating the quads and not using nearly as much weight I'm doing like three plates on the hacksquad not eight plates on the hacksquad so I don't need because I'm not using my glutes because I've got four inch heel elevation I've got six inches of heel elevation I got three in my shoes and then I've got a three semi roller so it's a six inch heel elevation or that's a massive so my knees are going way the fuck out away from the rest of my body and then I'm driving my hips forward with posterior pelvic tilt and I basically 60 squatting three plates on a hacksquad versus having my feet all the way at the front of the platform so that the shin is completely straight up and down there's the knee doesn't go any further than the ankle you know I mean and you're using all glutes it's like the difference between benching like this and benching like this yeah it's completely different this is all triceps this is all chest and shoulders so this is why it's even more biceps than this triceps and this is why what what I'm coming to I say this as well when you're dealing with say injuries and people say oh my knees this or whatever it's like yeah look I still think there there's an argument to be said that you just no on times at 10 you just have to go a lot of you have to go a lot slower on your eccentric loading and learning how to be comfortable in the stretch position you know because that's a scary place to be we want to get out actually I'm going to get in there and the blood's done cool up in the quads you're on that hacks hacksquad sushi squat we call for you right you know when you get any of that bottom position you're going to stop thinking about you know the a form of such a you know you just more like oh my quads are killing me you know I just want to get up to think that's how natural reaction is humans right so we have to learn to essentially be comfortable without uncomfortable and sit there you know so so coming down super slow as you said you know you used to be doing fire plates aside now you now you you're back up to three of you probably have to start off on one or two plates learning this new method and yeah the stimulus to feel the pain through the quads that you're receiving it's a place you certainly don't want to be right but at the same time we have to go to that place so far these guys are trying to come in with say they're five plate hacksquad like you're doing and trying to learn these new methods is saying oh my knees are killing me it's like yeah I could probably shock him about that they would be killing um you're going to have to just understand that although this is a hacksquad I wouldn't even call it a variation I would just call this completely different mm-hmm and um it's such a great feeling because if I drive my knees forward like this I can get a lot of lateral quad if I drive my knees out like this I get a lot of adductor and lateral quad if I do a here it's the most amount of lateral quad you can't do that fast you have to turn down so slow and then in the stretch position you have to kind of wiggle it around a little bit and be like oh right here yeah here that's where I feel the most middle-doubt most lateral quad I'm going to push my big toe down okay big toe down internal rotation of the femur and I'm going to posterior pelvic toe oh shit that's way more quad okay instead of pushing through the heels I'm an a leg extension and you leg extension out and you're you're it looks like you're doing the press because it's a hacksquad but you do a leg extension from a maximally stretched posterior pelvic tilt position and you're trying to keep it off of your pateler tendon off of your quadricept tendon and onto just your lateral quad you're not going to be able to use plates with that level precision because the the idea is well of you know my knees early wanted to it's like sometimes I'm doing sets now and let's just use a single leg leg press for example right you know because it's happening on today and I was doing the movement and as I was coming down I just dropped the hook with my knee yeah my god yeah you know fix it up glitching my knee again and I'm like it wasn't enough to stop it was more for me I'm maturing up that I understand you know the glitches because the precision isn't there right I had to now okay slower right down right slower right fucking down and start understanding what we're trying to do from top to bottom you know because that's the other thing too when people get to the bottom of the movement this is a common thing that happens when I tell people to pause in the stretch position as they say and I'll get comfortable stretch position oh but my low back enough to take over well when you get to the bottom it doesn't mean you relax that's the time when you're focusing the most on say the quad or the chest or whatever it is to make sure it is fully under tension to say those areas from taking over that's why when I always look at knee pain back pain hit pain whatever it is to me it's a build up of something you're not doing because those areas are only gonna take over if the biggest storm of muscles are doing the work to protect it copper mobility before you train and proper warm upsets that if you're feeling knee pain on your first set but not your second set and it's the same load it's because you didn't warm up enough for the first set because your first set was both the warm upset and it works so like a lot of times I'll go in there I won't stretch my try set about at all I'll do my first set try set my elbows I'm fire then I stretch it after that first set then I second set I don't feel tricep at all I don't feel elbow at all I feel just tricep so your fan of stretch is low well yeah I'm 46 years old I don't stretch I snap but I'm a huge kind of stressful yeah the whole point is to get blood in that tissue and to contract the target muscle of people like oh but you deactivate and when you stretch you like calcium ions out of the sarco mirror and it prevents you from activating the two expivers it's like well do I want to activate the two expivers and hurt myself or do I want to properly stretch the muscles so that it can get to its maximum size and pump it full of blood and just do more sets to get the same amount of stimulus at no risk when I I was first introduced to this when I was one of the oldest trait in techniques I still throw in here and they're just for the fun of it enough as you know I started to raise these but honey rembords old Episodes seven stuff you know the seven sets with the stretching between sets and people say you know I was just you know pumps because you have 30 seconds break I said now the pumps come from the stretching between the sets and then obviously applying that over time I'm like well if it works there half on I'm not doing this elsewhere in my workouts you know and I think you know as if you're like you're a part of your body of warming up protocols needs to be like I can't just walk into it like even if it's a lot of cave betroths there attention warm up yeah my elbows just off you know take it time just let them let them loosen up it stretch them out like allow the blood flow to kind of get into you know people say I do stretch cold it's like I think once you get any more blood in the muscle right you can probably go for a deeper stretch I mean it's yeah the finishing returns to like how far do you really have to stretch the trusset with a quad to you know make sure it's kind of warmed up you don't need to be hitting pb's and looking to try hit the splits between you know yeah yeah your hamstring curls right but you know there there there's a certain point there but I do believe that yes like I think you should be stretching pre-workout during a workout and even post-workout especially post-workout so like if I don't feel pain in the left elbow I don't need to stretch the right left tricep yeah cool but if I'm feeling pain in the right elbow and that pain is prohibiting me from getting the maximum amount of reps then I'm never even going to get to those two expibers because I'm going to abort the set out of fear or pain so it's better to sacrifice one or two to let a little bit of calcium ions in by stretching and it doesn't have to be a super deep fucking stretch you don't have to tear the sarco mirrors apart to allow the calcium ions in you could just get that muscle to the maximum length that it still has muscle tension get correct or on your warm-up sets hold the stretch for two seconds on every rep to eight reps with 50% load but hold the stretch against resistance then you don't have to work so hard with the other muscles trying to stretch that tricep and also getting countable and that's what too like I said before like you have people going to that stretch position but what I just went up blast through that warm-ups nice and quick and then go try and stretch on a heavy loading it's like now you're not going to do that like as you said if you're coming into a lot of repress come down and just chill there you warm-ups and understand okay that's what I feel is like for my chest I don't know if I can feel the blood cut of so you're letting in then it's going to feel what safer when you come down because you don't have to stretch for as long on your heavier sets because yeah you're not doing it for three or four seconds you're going to have to come down for one maybe two and draw it back up and like if you're like you're in a maximum stretch position now squeeze the muscle to fight the stretch and allow it to move through the range of ocean then fight the eccentric so you're actively resisting the eccentric on the way down and to that eight to twelve times and that's a set and then you can if you know and that's that if you train like that you're going to get a lot of hypertrophy out of very little load and people like will you you grow better with heavier load just like relative to who like who are you comparing these studies are done on 20-year-old children with 20 pounds of total body muscle mass these are not going to grow what do you want how to 40-year-old man like if you're not taking a adult man who's been training for 20 years and applying these teeny-bapar principles they're going to get hurt and they're not going to be able to lift it all and that's where I see all the time is you get a new coaching client who's a lifestyle client he's in his 50s and he wants to do heavy ass exercises and they always hurt themselves it's like you don't have the skill to handle the load that's where your program for machines that freeweights are their own skill a skill you don't have this is a skill you needed to learn 30 years ago when you were in high school and you didn't learn it's a skill that I haven't as a skill as you said that I didn't need it now you know right we have machines I don't know a lot of people say all you know I've really commented this and I colored it that I'm like yeah but we have the availability these days as well you know like we have released not as people turn their own butter yeah we don't sure now on butter we buy it at the store you know so it's also a small are you good we we have the value you know with all these fantastic gym companies out there and they try to you know compete for who has the best mechanical pathway so it's like yeah fucking take advantage of it man I just went to I went to bed also the first time yesterday and I remember we spoke last week and I said I didn't beat the gym so it was my first exposure there it's only around the corner actually and man like you can see why people love training now because the first thing I said was I'm like doesn't matter where you're injured on your body you could train here and find something to assist with your injury you had elbow pain or somebody there is a machine man I'm talking like 50 different fucking bison machines you know a hundred different hacks like yeah it's just like it's unbelievable but you know that's why people would excel on those types of places because like oh this hacks work probably feels a bit off or you know it's said the hacks what you'd like the best for you is you know you might like the sidebecks I might like the hamstrings you know it just depends solely on the person but regardless what you feel comfortable with and doing and getting the rough stimulus is also going to create far less injury which is the other parts where we're coming out of these exercises like we're just saying now that you're coming in and smashing quads on the hacks work with the right technique the right stimulus the right term by all the above your quads walking out now absolutely pride but there's no overworked through the low back there's no overworked through the glutes you're not coming out sweating for hugely sitting there go I go I'm going to try to breathe and decide what date is it's like you don't need to be right for a set now we need that backslap but you know I come on you got a push and you know and forget about everything else because you're just going to push the light up that's that's turning it that white lift and mentality not bodybuilding you know not not not try to use a tool to help build a house it's like to me Olympic lifting it would be like being a professional buttered churner if you're lactose intolerant it's just that there's no logic at all that using free weights and 2021 it is such an antiquated dumbass way of doing anything it'd be like why would you rob a bank with a bomb when you can rob it with a note you know none of what these people do makes any sense they're just flailing away at the illusion of masculinity by like throwing the weight up in the air and then slamming it down it's like bitch you've got colored weights there's nothing much about you shut up yeah exactly and that's why you know as a side of people what I work with a lot of gods of work on flying fly-up thoughts when they work here the minds and stuff like that yeah look they're going to be restricted you know they're going to be okay look I don't have the fancy gym I've got a gym the the campus set up for us it's majority free weights a leg person and a Smith machine it's like well look we're going to work with what we can but I can tell you right now majority of the compounds are probably going to be other could Smith machine bro you know it's like the gym I train our downstairs it's a little hard core grungy gym there's a lot of machines they don't have there so I've had to resort to some dumbbell pressing and things like that and look I got to do it you know it's fine it's it's the gym that I'm out and I locked that gym I like training there and but that as I said like if I was to choose if it also is just a little bit closer you probably would be there because of the simple fact that they literally have every machine there for every pathway you can fit to your body's heart it's just like amazing so you just get rewarded like the machines and the you know the the the amount of precision they put into these machines these days as I said like what is the point of a free weight I just I can't understand that I mean for my bicep curls I do preacher dumbbells rather than preacher machines because no matter what it's going to hurt my elbow because it's not exactly right for my ergonomics and that's about it other than certain bicep exercises because of tendonitis I don't see a point to free weights at all dumbbell presses are a great way to train your chest I think I like dumbbell presses they're also very dangerous once you get into a weight that you have to throw up into position by the time you get to a load it can't be a first exercise you have to pre-exhaust your chest before dumbbell presses otherwise you're never going to really get the right ratio the stimulus to fatigue ratio you're always one tweak away from tearing your muscle right off the bow with them oh yeah I can tuck and say that yeah I can tell you yeah I can tell you yeah the dumbbell presses should be a second or third exercise with 12 reps 10 to 12 reps if you're earlier in the workout or heavier than 12 10 to 12 reps you're doing it wrong this is just there to get a good fucking chest stimulation maybe a try some stimulation especially if you're down here and you're doing like jam presses like so one thing I don't I mean not they want to make his mind chest is by my way his body parts but fly work I notice you said you do a lot of fly work for chest I didn't I just started because Chenecchi talked me into it he was like even though your triceps because what I've been doing is only process because my triceps is so much weaker than my chest and I was doing only two sets of presses three times a week and my chest went for one of my best body parts to like one of my worst body parts in just one season so this my kiss roots healthier you that you just need a little bit of volume to maintain the muscle I don't think that's true that because I was if I do nine sets of chest twice a week my chest grows like a week if I do two sets of chest three times a week it shrinks so right now I'm up to six sets of chest three times a week and it's slowly coming back sorry six sets of chest three times a week and you were doing two sets yeah was doing two sets three times a week okay yep yep yep so Chenecchi talked me into putting in some flies first and to really stretch out the packs really stretch out the packs really stretch out the packs with the flies and then just squeezing against the stretch and then and then lowering the weight and then just just basically it's a finesse move with the pack deck I always had good form with my pack deck a lot of people they do this stuff the whole smash most muscular yeah and they're getting all but there's no chest at all in this it's all shoulders and biceps yeah so I always did this with the um I always did that with the pack pack right I'm stretching out all the way of course but stretch it all the way and then come in like your karate chopping someone in the yeah yeah yeah you karate artery and then that really gets the chest both to stretch it out all the way and then come in like that and then it's not just for the purpose of pre-exhausting the chest it's a real work set but now when I go do chest it's not like I'm not using I won't using all well it's the same amount of load and I'm getting about to see my reps but I just get so much more chest out of it then when I switch to triceps oh man it really nails the triceps what I used to do is just go in there and do just tricep focus process and it was just a bunch of shoulder tendons and elbow tendons now it's completely different story so then okay so you would you would you so you're hitting chest three times a week you would hit six sets upon each day obviously you tie triceps into that so then you would hit say like a fly first then that a pressing movement and then move into triceps yeah so so two to two to two flies to what this is after the eight sets of back so if you the eight sets of back six laps two upper back I'm going to start putting rear delts in earlier because I'm going to be at the pectac anyway I might as well do the reverse pectac and then the pectac is a super such and then I can save some time there because otherwise I'm doing rear delts at the end of the workout after I've done middle delts and I don't give a fuck anymore I'm mentally checked out by that point so my rear delts started getting smaller because they were to be on the back burger for too long yeah but I'm emotionally attached to my middle delts so I've never checked out for middle delts but I don't I'm not emotionally attached to my rear delts so by the if I do the middle delts my rear delts after middle delts the I always have checked out for a year I did the rear delts first I would do rear delts then I would do pectac like an anachastay I do rear delts then I do pectac me to you then I would go to presses and that's how I got my strong is that's when I have the best chest that's when I with my best pressure is weird delts then pectac then presses yeah yeah it makes a lot of sense so then when you would go to two and two and then that's when you finish after that on a truss of accessory like an isolation based movement after the closed group no I see that for the next day and I do six sets of tricep isolation that next day so it'd be upper and then it's the next day starts with triceps and that it's going to be extension based off either cables or Vulcans or overhead or dip machine actually a little bit so then it's going to get a little bit but didn't I should do an upper lower upper arms lower upper arms lower upper arms lower okay yeah yeah okay that makes sense that okay that makes sense yeah because I'm I'll do exactly everything the same as you except I move chest first and sit it back okay yeah I have the other way around and then yeah and then then arms and then lower yep I find pushpool legs I think has its placed yes but I don't know I just I it always comes back around to the fact that when you say you mentally check out definitely with the pushpool legs like with arms I find I've just always trained better what I put the truss at blyceb together and that's where there were two legs yes I so it's so with pushpool legs for example I think it's great for most people I just find it for myself I don't know what it is it's just when it comes to the the blyceb truss component I just kind of as I said mentally check out so I'm like now look I got to put them both together and so instead of pushpool legs that's where I'll hit there's a sense it's more of like the upper arms and then legs and same thing with legs through deparering legs together I've always had this place I tried multiple times and you know appearing back in pants through together I'll still try on those things here and there but I just have a little bit of shame thing I just I kind of I do think I just said before what you said with the whole mentally checking out there I think you need to feel that state of focus the whole way through you know so just because you might have something that's right on paper that you need to bring a week marks a year before it's still has to come and so what you're actually going to really put in without sessions well and I've always felt better putting truss ups and moths together and separate day the cool thing about blyce of truss arms and legs on the same day you don't have to train them at the same time you could go do fast cardio and then hit arms with and it have an intro workout when you do arms then you could go home have a couple of meals come back and do legs if you want to do that if you don't what I do is I go to the gym I go in their pretty cold and hit arms and that's my warm up then I go do a little bit of cardio to get my legs loosened up I do my leg mobility and stretching I keep drinking my intro and then I've emotionally recovered from my arm workout and now I'm already to go for my leg workouts so I don't have to warm up into the legs the mobility it gets it already and then I just go do two sets of hamstrings two sets of these squat presses of whatever variation two sets of the other hamstring leg curl and then two sets of leg extensions by this point I'm checked out and then it's like okay I got a throw in some fucking ad drs and calves and then I throw in the ad drs and the calves when I was putting ad drs early I wasn't emotionally invested if I put calves early Mike my ankles aren't warm up enough to handle the loads I need for calves So I have a splitting up then see as a moving into the training to us today feel how do you got that program in that or are you a fan of that because that's one thing I actually did which I actually I've loved it man when I had my quad chair right my mentality I spoke to John about it I said this man you know like what are we gonna do you know I don't want to stop coaching you know otherwise I'll just fall off the rock completely I said can I come to you with an idea so yeah what is it and I said look can I train twice a day where I'll do chest in the morning go home and have a couple meals so I'll eat chest in the morning have a couple meals to the afternoon and come back the next day have a meal train back have a couple of meals come back show shoulders in the afternoon following day quads of the morning the doctors have turned calves and abs in the afternoon I couldn't train quads obviously at the time because I took a quad the momentality was that I've trained twice that before in contest perhaps in stuff just you know out of cardio purpose is really because I really don't think you can train as hard overall I just think there is you're battling some of your things you can do but for me I said to myself mentally I said look I'm not gonna train well because you know I can't even go to the tour properly with this tour in quad but if I can so much as work yeah it's why today to keep my brain stimulated and happy that I'm you know just go to the gym you know so be it but as the quads start to recover I really actually enjoyed this split and obviously coming into my quad rehab that's where I started putting in the leg work and things like that and I've always said to myself I'm like I feel like I did that ride I still think it'll be a place there for train it's whilst they especially made you in a contest break where you know you could use that as your extra cardio session later that day because you're always gonna be in more calories in a heavy duty weight session and what you would you know sitting on a treadmill or a barcrest and austenra so I always kept that there like I was never been fully against it I haven't gone down that route again since but it actually worked really well for me as far as keep my muscles full and shining well and obviously you know brain side in dread injury have you ever had experience so that were you're doing so it's was today or anything like that you only tell my leg training twice a day is when I had an apartment behind the gym and all I had to do was walk outside at a walk across the parking lot into the back door of the gym if I have to get in my car and drive through traffic it fucks up my mood I just don't like people I don't like waiting yeah so I don't want to have to leave my house ever I don't even like having two stories I don't like having to go up and down stairs so like I like to have everything the kitchen the bathroom the bedroom the theater the studio everything's on one floor and I just never want to leave I thought about buying the apartment under me and just putting a gym in that so I couldn't just never leave my at least we got one workout in a day where like if I did just in back in the morning I could do delts in the evening I could do legs in the morning and do arms in the evening that would make sense to me and then alternate like that but that's like a hundred grand investment minimum we'll see I know you want to get all panata new tech with me downstairs is where my gym is that's why I've kind of revisited y'all you know I'm killing my work at the moment there's a lot of duty because just chamontal I'm saying it's not you know it's so hard so it's like I wonder if I could revisit that channel where there's literally better yeah you said you go downstairs you're a part of them and you walk across the pot what the building next to me here on the grand four is the gym all it's basting so that's where my go I wonder you know I could trial it for a little bit while I'm here just to see how I could actually revisit them do it properly because I had my engine back home in Australia so I could do it because obviously I was working out of the gym and I was there it's my home sports or I had kind of you know do what I had to do it was it was a probably the routine was but he it's like probably more convenient you know because there is no drive and there's no nothing like that so it's like it probably could work I could do like the old year age 70s hours they made you know when you they go train and I could go upstairs my rooftop 10 mill the day I'm getting a 10 on there come back and train it afternoon you know but yeah people say you know you get a lot of overwork at the teague but I think it's actually more of the fact that when you're training twice a day it's as you said it's the it's the fuck around of you know the driving and the instrument that and prepping everything up where as you said like you it's literally you're living above the gym it could it could definitely work. Yeah so now I like totally in the mood to go hit the gym because like I train believing that and a plant fitness for my upper body because people just leave me the fuck alone it's like I'm three weeks out I just don't want to have to interact with people and it's like luckily at the planet fitness no one feels comfortable approaching me you know and so that's what I would much prefer and it's like if on the leg day I go to the my normal powerhouse and no one really talks to me there either but it's just like you recognize enough people where you're expected to nod and make eye contact and that's still too much emotional energy for me to waste in the middle of a workout like there's nobody should get any of my fox all my fox should be given to the training and and then once I'm all out of fox to give I still have more such to do so I certainly can't sacrifice fox on people. It's a big one man and look at his other thing too because you are familiar with that gym and you're probably part of the French and they're trying to stay long you know I don't have to deal but it's hard because although you're in contest prep and things like this we touched on this last week people still expect you to say hi you know people will still talk to you like like hey man you're killing your leg session it's like these are all positive well hey man if I can look and grade they are this new training you're doing a new school chair you really work it well but the thing is it's still energy for you man and I think off season or pre-contest like you know people forget like it's it's not a place to socialize but it's just better just eliminate yourself from that atmosphere like a bonus for example yes that was fantastic gym but I was also star struck because there's a lot of big dudes there so I'll be a rosewalk through there I'm like nah Jesus Christ but that took me away from my focus right where we're trying downstairs there's these Indian Guards that I know and devise a pretty you know chilled place as far as everyone keeps themselves not really approached you here so I love going down there because it's been the whole gym is just hamistering also hamisterings the same stuff you'd have in a planet of foodness or anytime any time fitness but the atmosphere is really awesome because they love body beauty but they get no one approaches you right so I can just kind of go down there and focus and I can train to believe it or not that will still be my homies in there compared to what it be it's again I saw we're going to get us what you want the week just for you know some motivation or whatever it is but you know training the full time and they said not to not to sold out because of the fact I just know the positive distractions are still distractions right absolutely so I think that's a good note to leave for this episode next episode we'll do nutrition because now I'm all fired up to go hit lads after this talk about training but I'm glad you like I'm going to do a part we have a pot three I'm glad you like I have me on man I'm I'm yeah did you're great I like like talk to you a lot and appreciate I'm anxious interested in hearing what you eat in order to get so big and we'll cover that next time but it's cool that we got to tack shop my favorite subject is talking about training unfortunately I'm labeled as a steroid person and it's just like me too do you know it's funny like when you reached out to me initially you got you want to come to podcast I said dude I don't know why I ran gear nothing like you or some like John you know you guys are the experts he'd be I'm even late when we use a gear I got right but our people just come to me because and they asked me about this stuff but I've always said that when you want to teach someone something whether to be training nutrition or gear can you explain it to someone who's in grade three or you keep it simple and I find what happens out now I don't know how difficult it is but I find what happens now to it is that it's like people have to um and you're out you are the science girl right you you have that background so you you'd be able to see through a bit of the more I can't but people try to use these big words and big sentences and let's kind of share it right to make themselves sound smarter and they've almost confused people so they go oh I got to go to this guy because he's so technical but it really is where it's like no I find I get the respect and the people that come to me in that retrospect because I can dumb it down say it's simple you know can you take something in complex and read upon it and learn about it and explain it is such a simple matter for someone I understand you go oh that's all it is it's like yeah that's all it is oh my last coach told me this is this no it doesn't have to be that fucking complicated man like what do you put us on a path smart I don't look that smart you know mean that you just got to dumb it down as simple for us so we understand all the concepts as as easy and as short as possible people are not concise and they're not clear and that a pattern recognition and an analogizing stuff is the key I think to communicating with people so that you can get it into them and their frame of reference so they can assimilate it into their existing data cell it's funny man because when they when they come through and say some questions to me online now to say them like you know I'm not gonna sit there and pretend I fucking know everything I said do that or I fuck I don't know yeah there's some things I don't know I'm not gonna and I find that's when people respect you more because they're like okay I'm like yeah if I look I'll look I'll find it whatever it is I'll learn about it and you know people respect you so much more because like oh you're not fool of shit then so when you do talk like okay he's not just talking shit or yeah just to kind of keep up with the conversation it's like if there's something you don't know it's like last week man you talk about that last week about um but was it I learned something from you last week DHB here I was thinking I was being conservative with my doses and you're like oh no man just watch out for that you know you can on the handle 20 20 megaday and my goal is shit okay well I've been going to a blood test in a couple of days and I went and did it thankfully I came back in my blood scan back all clear which they usually do but you know there are things I learned as well man you know what I mean so I'm not gonna sit there pretend I'm some fucking expert in everything there's always room for improvement always room to to take in more knowledge all right cool well we'll do this next week maybe a little bit later in the day so I don't jerk you around like I did today that I thought I'd be up on time to get my fast and cardio in but my picture and my picture looks yeah my picture looks so good that um Dom had me do another medium day so I had to make a different breakfast that's what pushed me that's why it was a little bit further back down down it's half of shit right here and you're in prep on how it is what you got to do I get it I'm an amazing I'm in the bar man if you're looking about all that so you just you know what you were doing alright cool man I appreciate you so much alright I'll talk to you next week then thank you bro have a great one bye
