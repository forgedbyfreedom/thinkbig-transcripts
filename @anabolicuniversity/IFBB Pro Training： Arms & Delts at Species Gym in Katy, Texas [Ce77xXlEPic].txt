We're here! You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. You're watching Dr. Todd Lee TV. I'm going to try to lift with Martin. If he's too busy, that's cool. We can do legs tomorrow and upper body, Friday or Saturday. Saturday I think. Thanks man. Okay, so this is huge. Hold my god, this is a big chip. Wow, look how big this is. It's a lot of stress. All right, so we got not a list. That looks like that. This looks like this would be cool. Is this a new track? There's a pendulum. All right, now we're cooking. So I've checked out most of the leg and chest and back stuff. Hold these legs up all the way. Hold it around. All right, let's go check out the other leg stuff. So this, I would definitely want to do this machine for back. Yeah, we'll back today, of course. Just, you know, like that definitely want to do that for back up. And then there was one that that for back, that for back. That right, there's probably enough back. And then there's tons of shut stuff. Then there's the pendulum. Yeah, there's this pendulum slot and then there's another one there. I think there's another one. Let's go check this leg curl. Leg extension. Oh shit. Look at this. It's big red. Yeah, I want it. We'll fuck dude. What do you think that one? I guess that's one form of pendulum. It's like a pendulum. Yeah. Dude, every gym. There's another pendulum there. Oh my god. Like you've got more equipment in one gym than we have in our whole state. What the fuck? So overwhelming, right? Yeah, it's crazy. Wow. Fiking press. I've been using this one since the old gym. It's almost like an iron workout. It's a waste of a workout because it's so simple. It's just some cable stuff. But I wanted to check everything out in advance before I knew exactly what I'd be doing when I got here for legs and chest and back. So normally what I do for arms is I do a cable, press down, try set. Then I usually do a dumbbell preacher. Then I usually do an overhead thing. But I usually pull a chair up so I can actually lean into it. And then I usually end with Beijing curls. So it's pretty much all cables except for oh my god. Looked there's more equipment. How do they not see that should hit before? This is okay, like this, this, this, this, on the whole workout right here. We can do the whole workout right here. There's no one here. Not right now. It does get pretty busy now. When you got all your leg curls, leg extensions, lying leg curls, donkey calf. I like the donkey calf the best. Yeah. So see that standing in donkey calf. More leg curls, more leg curls. This is what I usually use. Nice. Oh, this is a cable. Yep. Oh, this looks awesome. Finally, in a piece of arm equipment. We're definitely going to use this for my steps. Oh, and then laterals, I'll do shoulders to the guy in the day. I did shoulder gesture, didn't really do anything. This looks amazing. Yep. You point in all of all the things that I use most right here. That doesn't stretch. I'll just end up a bit. Yeah, I don't know what we're going to do with this. We get shorter handle. Yeah, maybe it hits. There's no tension either of a monothlik. None of them have tension in the bottom. Let's just go dumb dumb balls. Actually, let's do try steps first then. I'm then warming it up. And I got short arms. So if I had longer arms would be even less useful. Yeah. Do you know where the chairs are? Like the portable chairs? We sum over here? All the way over there. Over there by the other dumbbells. There you go. It's kind of ready. All you got my right hand. I got mine right here. If you like a rope, this is a really comfortable rope handle. I usually go with these because if I squeeze it, it hurts my elbow. But you can do it on that one if you want. I mean, I'm not in a hurry. Obviously, it's an arm workout. We got all day. Yeah, some of this stuff's a little ready. But the way chairing is going to be. Cross body like this. Someone recognized me over there. It's cool. Yeah. You said I helped him a lot. Not going to lie. This feels really good. It feels really good like that. Better than this. Now. I got one that's got elastic in it. I can feel this fucking crazy. Yeah, there's a few people around here up top two about you. That my recognized you if they were here. Your channels grow and so I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see people all the time in a gym that know you. I'm going to grab the other handle. I've got another handle. This be better than that. What is this type of music called? I have no idea about this. Okay. To me, it's not as bad as rap. No, it's usually rap. Oh, okay. Yeah, this is a head drum stem. This is where I'm the hurry, even as well. Do one I would try. All right, I'm almost done warming up here. We'll get serious in a second. Derek, always finishes with those. Do you want to do that or do you want to take turns on this? Okay. Let's try and get them warmed up. Yeah. Maybe a mandol show to say hi. My hope so. If not today, maybe tomorrow or the day after. Right arm. I'll go right. You do right. Yeah. I go left. It gives our arms and maximum rest time. What are you doing with this? Just like that. Yeah. No, heavy. What are you going to do like 15? So I was coming across my body and keeping my elbow locked in. Yeah. I feel a little more inside. Long heavier. I've got a good pump already. I didn't inject any injectable pre-workouts or idea for one. None of that. I just drank my fanrice and had two meals. So I heard Coach Danny talking about GHK. Uh-huh. And then, mad plus. And a D plus? Yeah. I used both of them. He's at a stacker. Is that like something you cycle through? No, I don't believe you're cycle. No, it's just all the time. Yeah. Well, it's my left turn. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry I raised it up. It's a little too heavy for me. What was that? Yeah, I'm sorry I raised it up. We went to 27. Yeah, I was on 17. Try. Okay, cool. You're a lot firm now. But I would do this try to keep your arm pinned. There you go. In the last few feel better your way. How do people come to the gym for social hour? I can't stand that show. Well, to me, this is good social hour because I was happy to finally get to meet you. Yeah. No, I just mean people that want to come here and wash it. They might have a lot more time than I do. Yeah, I do. All right, cool. Yeah, feels good. We'll try half of that. We'll try 22. Yeah. Oh, if I'm like tired, tired, I might want to wait for Friday. Just let me know. But theoretically, I should do legs tomorrow. I've been rushed after legs rather than rushed and then go into legs. And then go into Chuston back to the after legs because it'll be trashed. Going into Chuston back and then I would be driving on it. What did I have it on? You had 27. What did I have on the side? Oh, I saw you for the night. Oh, baby, please. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That was brutal. Man, this said, would be nice if you all worked out in the morning. I couldn't. I'd work tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. If we better Friday morning, if we're going to work in the morning, I'd rather do legs Friday morning. Get off. You go in two sets so far. I'm liking this. I'm liking this a lot. It's herand's way of doing it. What we could do instead of doing two exercises, three sets, we could go three exercises, two sets each. You finish with this and then we'll try my tri set for two sets. Okay. Now that I've tried this out, I don't think I'm going to get anything out of the third set. I'm not getting out of two sets. Now that last set for me was a grind of wood. You scored Pio? Yeah. Score Pio is in the best. Yeah, except all the astrological street is always long for me. Huh? All the astrological street is always long for me. Oh. Like I don't hold grudges. And they say score Pio's whole grudges and definitely. Eh, that might be a more women thing. I think that an ice find that male score Pio is just very driven, wheel power of type of person. You point them in a direction they'll run through brick wall. If what you tell them is what they want us in the other side of that wall. Two of that short on that side. I can solder some on. Does she mind going through deep on legs? It's not my ever-give. More than two people in the workout, which is very rare. Just to suit their sets. Everybody stays busy and nobody's sitting around for more than a minute or two. You didn't have to the time. You're good. Are you just looking for the right position? I'm not tall enough. This is too long. I wasn't getting a stretch. I'm not sure if I can do it. I'm not sure if I can do it. So what I'm trying to do is keep my elbows in tight. Pull it away for me for the first 10-12 reps. And then I'll push them together and drive them forward for the next 12. Same set, 24 reps. Good about that. But I want to keep these elbows as far back as I can. Never letting them come back. Keep being the scapula depressed right there. Without that shrugging your fact. Right there. Good. Without the body English well. Am I moving? Yeah. Just keep it still. It's easy to get a full stretch. You don't let those elbows come up. I might want you heavy. Yeah, probably. Put squeeze at the bottom. Don't let them come apart. Good. There you go. There you go. Chest up, elbows back. Don't let those elbows come forward, though. Keep those elbows back. Those elbows can come forward. That's it. That's it. That's right there. That's small movement. Right there. Go right there. Go right there. Go right there. That's it. Brutal huh? Ow. See how small these movements are? How many elbows stay in the same spot? One, two, three, four, five. Go right there. There you go. That's it. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Alright finish the set. Push together. Here we go. Chest up. Keep the shoulders down. Keep the elbows back. There you go. Hold on. Got it. Let's go switch to biceps. We'll finish with triceps. You can have triceps. You should have changed with it. You said that the preacher benches are over there. There's a preacher bench. Right where that dude's standing. So someone already moved a bench over here. We can do triceps there. More cardio shift. It's a arbitrary. Where's it? Okay cool. Unless you want to see it one. Can you adjust this so that it's a little bit lower for me? Oh shit. I didn't mean to make it so. Alright. Good try. So right now it looks like you're a alignment tall. I would tilt your body like this. Now try it. You probably are so light. You probably don't notice the difference. You can look in the mirror. If you look in the mirror, you can see if you can line up your hand with your elbow with your shoulder. Yeah, that looks much better. 20 pounds you probably never know this. But if we start getting heavy and doing it all every week. I never go very heavy doing curl. Well, you. I'm doing your lot heavier than me. Alright, we'll probably get with this wave. So if you look in the mirror, your elbow is out and the inside of your shoulder. That's as far as my elbow bends. But I think fine, doesn't come any closer than that. I'm just trying to keep them in the line. You're a little bit too heavy. You're a little bit too heavy. That's good. Alright, so when I go 30 or when I go 25, I don't care. I follow you, dude. So it says 30, but it was in a rack space of said 35. Yeah, look at the species. So I don't know what this really is. It's the 30. I'm going to throw it. That's a good one, I don't even give you a lot of. What? Three reps? Yeah, three reps. Yeah, three reps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to do a much of difference with an extended wrist versus. Yeah, there's a difference. You get less by yourself if you squeeze it. Yeah, I'm going to put that picture on. Yeah, I don't know. I wonder if they have to pay a check or not, but we're going to put that picture on. Yeah, I don't know. I know it's quite the process. It's kind of like, paint my numbers. Oh, it was great thing. Oh. She want to go grab a 55. I'm going to take it with a 30. You're going to tear it up there. I don't train heavy on my biceps. The openness is my favorite thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll see what it feels like. Yeah, I mean, thumbs up, smash with dumbbells. More than three. That was like 30. I'll use the 35. I'll see what it feels like. Yeah, I mean, thumbs up, smash with dumbbells. More than three. That was like 30. She would have been the perfect way. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good shit. I think I'd get him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What are you weigh in right now? There's 1808 this morning. Yeah. And when you're in the off season, how had it been? Yeah. I'm probably never again though. Yeah. I'm probably never going to get that big. We got to come down six pounds in the week. I weighed in at 1703 pretty much. No idea. No really care, I guess. What the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That first set of biceps ups off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He got shoulder down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have that problem. I always put it on a lollipop field setting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It seems to be like almost an even split between white, black and Hispanic. But now it's pretty diverse, I don't say. So that was my second and last work set for tri-subs. And then after this we've got two set-to-basion curls, which we could do here, or we could do it over there, or we left my stuff. Almost got like a chasperum from that last time. That last set. That last set really did it. Backpack, we should have had four. There's so much cool backpushing. We're not going to do any rowing at all, because I fucked up my back doing all those rowing yesterday. We only did four sets of ladden, like 10 sets of rows. So when we do that, Saturday, we're going to be doing every one of these vertical machines. These look good, Jamie. So good, so cool. All right, here we go. Phase two. Yeah. White there. Get a little bit more of a stretch. There. Go. Yeah. That was good. All right, now we've got the As you feel. And then we can move on to that bonus round of middle delts. I was lazy. I think I wish I brought two in. I was lazy. Don't let me forget to do it, I forgot to do it yesterday. FIREMer Lad�� Splendid! either or. I just like the call. It takes my wrist in my hand out of it. Yeah, we try. All right. Yeah. It's easier for some else reps you in. There you go. Come on, like a hammer. Either way. You could do supinated for 10 and neutral for 10, however you want to do it. The important thing is keep it chest straight. Keep your elbow as far behind you as it goes. There you go. What you call these face Bayesian. Facy. The ASI and what is that from? You find out. Is that too light for you? Oh, it's great. So heavy as Bicep work I do is chin. Did you do both sides? I wanted a time. I usually do one at a time. I'm telling you right so far. What are you doing? We're not using our just shifts in the way. You're going to hold your elbow back.
