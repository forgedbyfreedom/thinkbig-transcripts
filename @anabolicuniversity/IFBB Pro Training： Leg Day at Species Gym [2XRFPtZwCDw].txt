Worry! You're watching, Dr. Todd Lee TV. Where theoretically you could learn a bunch of cool shit. I'm more tired than usual today. So I'm gonna try a little bit of the Biscuit for friends deep front of type. 200 pounds. That's about 150 milligrams of caffeine. That's a lot for me. Now we're off to hit legs. My leg, upper middle back area. It's probably like an 8 or 9 out of 10 pain. Worry'd just sleep so bad. I don't know. Because I was in pain. So I'm in pain. I don't know. I think because I did too much back volume. When I was at LeBrautah that I try my other pieces of a cuman. And it's always one spot at the space. Like the rhomboid, upper, medium, lad area. All the part that looks like it's just a big hole in my backpack when I do my rear last fret. That's where it hurts. Because it's glued down or some shit. Now I'd be worse because I did so much foam rolling on it. But I just aggravated it further. And it seemed to get its release just grounded down. I would move to do anything and it would just be stabbing pain. So I would say that it's the worst. It's ever been by a huge margin. I would say most, it's ever been. It was like a five out of ten in sornas. But like last night and then early in the morning it was like an 8 or 9 out of 10 pain. So we're going to go to this gym called species which is my client, patient and friend Jeremy's home gym. It has several different pendulum squats. I think like three or four pendulum squats. So I'm going to try out a couple like the mega mass and a couple other ones and see which one feels the best with no weight and then we'll start loading it up. Of course we'll do the other exercises. It'll be lying like curl, pendulum press, seated like curl, and like extension. But it does this all like a lot of volume but trying out different pieces to find the right thing. This can be a ton of junk volume. So even if all we're doing is force that of hands and force that's a quad. It'll be like ten sets to get that force sets. Probably have some adductors in there and caps. They got everything. I love how in Texas you got high school stadiums like that. They look like college stadiums. Sports or a priority? Well football specifically. Everything in Texas is bigger and better. Texas is just America. I want to own steroids but that in falsely elevates steroids is something that not. It's always so funny as people are like, yeah now that I'm on steroids I really don't notice any differences. Like I know they're like, so just they just don't do anything and like nope. That's what I was telling you that you don't need more than test and GH and about storage and not useful unless you're a professional bodybuilder or want to be a professional bodybuilder. Because the steroids allow someone to train harder and recover faster. So if somebody isn't training that hard and they're not dedicated towards bodybuilding, they don't then just that this size from the GH gives them enough recovery for their minimal amount of work. If they can bench 200 pounds for 5 reps and like all right that's retarded. You're going to do 150 for 10 reps and they only do that twice a week. Like you don't need steroids to recover from that. Now if you're doing 400 pounds for 12 reps for 5 sets and you need to do that three times a week. Yeah you would need steroids to recover that fast. But it doesn't make you bench 400 pounds. It just lets you recover. I'm not that I endorse bench pressing. It's an exercise every man knows. I may have a vague idea of how much weight that is. For that time, you're the one who's going to go. You're the one who's going to go. That's it! Yeah you should have had the highest rise. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah you should have the highest rise. The most important difference. The most important difference. Oh yeah let's do it. All right. That's not like it. It's definitely loaded in the stretch position so we don't need the strife. I like it. But there's not a lot of strength. The range of resistance where it's the strongest is different than the other ones. Yeah so here this is going to make this even better. All right. It makes the contraction phase too easy but it actually allows for a stretch. This doesn't go deep enough otherwise. Yeah this won't go deep enough other way. No there's no tension at the bottom. No I like it. I'll just use with pad. Jeremy you want to find your settings. Go ahead. You're dollar by the same size. You want to do the same savings? Is that your plate that says Sidious? Huh? Is that your plate that says Sidious? Yeah. I figured it was. Every version of Emperor was taken. But Sidious with one was not. Well we've been marathoning old Star Wars movies. We watched Revenge of the Sith last night. That's one of the best ones. Yeah. Episode three. Well Anakin wasn't such a tit in that one. Well yeah I mean that's my favorite one for Anakin for sure. See that's almost what I want to do. Set up a camera and film a girl watching Star Wars for the first time. To get her reaction video just because a lot of women think men are nerds for liking Star Wars. If you expose it to them right, it's one of the greatest stories I've ever told. I think I would have done a dark side. Oh for sure. I just murdered my mom. I didn't have to murdered my mom then my... Yeah. Well they probably did more than just murder. Oh yeah. They just didn't say that because it was the kids' world. Why's my X-Wast running wise to the O' eyes? You'll see. What does this mean? I'm gonna do it. Oh yeah. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Twenty. Well it's cool. Yeah. Is that a man though? Yeah. But where he won't find anything. He's probably got more pictures than I do. I think that's all the ones I downloaded. It was one cool one. Where I jumped. And Darth Vader was standing by a 10 feet away. It just looks like he's picking all the doors. What he's for stroking you. Yeah. She went one back for me. Hi. She said they look good. We talked about it. She's seen the night. So pretty. But I'm saying she's waked a candle. Yeah. What do you see? Well, she's said she's Moyk's. She was something older than me due to the emails at the bottom of my hand. She retained some room for me. Now… Now! She wants to be vítnitch. When there was much sex… and all people got scared. I always go for failure. I only got six. That time I was going to back it off to the next set. The goal is to set two sets of twelve, but that first warm-up set when I was finding my weight into a pitting teller. Then when I went to that weight, I got less reps on the second set than I did on the first set, even though I had done it through a half-suffice first. So had I done my first set with 90 would have been fine. That was awesome. So a lot of us scored it. That's my last set. I'm going to fix some break because I've been into another hair transplant. I'm going to do three reps of reserve. Then next week, two reps of reserve. Then the next week, one rep of reserve. Then the fourth week, I'll be trained to failure. Then each additional week, I'll start adding the rest pauses. It looks great Amanda. Good stretch at the bottom. Can you pause at the bottom? There you go. You got two left. One more. God. Did you feel that in your head? Did you like that? Did you feel your hamstrings a little better? I didn't like that a little bit better. I felt like the stretch in the bottom was fine. It seemed like it was more hamstrings the last lower back. There's one over here. Do you want to try the pad too? Sure. Then I'll have stretches in two parts. Oh, really? That's right. Good knee. You're a heel. It's something like that. It's either that or the gas truck tend to cross in the knee joint. I think poplar chill is the artery poplidious as the muscle. Did you lower your knees or these bend down the whole time? No, Amanda. Thank you. It's lower to the knee. Yeah, you were on 95 pounds last time. So you're on 100 pounds. There you go. I'm okay with staying with the same weight. And then I got 11 less? 11 plus, a quarter. That was a grind too. Right. You can tell me whether this is easier or harder with the pad. This music sounds like it's from a Tarantino music. It's fucking terrible. This isn't as bad. I was worried when I came in and I saw all the cars. I was like, oh, just going to be hit popfest. He's going to be so miserable. You know, it's very busy parking lot, but it's just a bunch of half-naked girls. So I don't care. Oh, definitely easier at the top. Yeah. Just squeeze it up and then squeeze it on the way down. It's almost like the right music for this. Taking the aggression out of it and making it just squeeze relax. Squeeze relax. Squeeze relax. Squeeze. Good. I think that was only eight. Huh? It doesn't matter. They'll do feel more hamstrings that way. Last lower back and more hamstrings. How was it feeling? Much of my lower back anyway. Yeah. All right. So next is pendulum squat. Do you want to try that mega mass? The big scary looking ones? Sure. Yeah. That felt good. Cool. That's what I want to hear. What is this, too? We're something to hold on to. All right. What? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really... Oh, yeah. It's really... Oh. Yeah. That's what we're looking for. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can't control you, sir But you're the worst I am the loser, man You're the loser, sir You're the loser, man I'm the loser, man I'm gonna take a few warm ups, that's for sure, to get used to this. How's that feel, Jeremy? Not great. Do you want to try the other one instead? The one you've heard you feel, but try it. I'm gonna try the other one instead. The one you've heard you feel, but try it. I'm gonna try the other one instead. The one you've heard you feel, but try it. Do you want to try the other one instead? The one you've heard you feel, but try it. Because my leg knee wasn't loving this either. Just a little really weak on this movement. What just typical happens with a machinist heavy as fuck? This is a 300 pounds fire. Yeah. So if it's just the weight, why don't we do a couple warm ups sets or we can try the other one, see which is more comfortable. Well, we should both be comfortable. I don't want to force anything. Okay. We can try it, but somebody's not on it already. There won't be a so heavy to begin with. We need to warm up. We can't warm up enough for it. This is way more comfortable. Yeah. Yeah. That's way more comfortable. Yeah. It might just be because it's lighter. There's also the bolt brand pendulum over there too. Which is funny because Terrence just bought into bold. Yeah. And he's not designing their products. He's Terrence. Terrence's roughened. And I was talking to him on Monday when I looked with him about it. Well, the gym that we were at before we came here, missed it. We're all he plays is metal. And it's all black and gray. This is way more comfortable. Way more quads. Are you cool with this one on the end of them? Have you done this one? Yeah. I can't. Really? Oh, that's it. It's heavy on light. This is really light. This feels great. Oh, my. Yeah. Try it out. You have the old species had an adjustable. What is this? Is this a ham shrink girl? I think it's a glue. Oh, yeah, you're right. Is that comfy? Yeah. You're the one in front of them. Oh, it's a, oh, you're right. It's a thrust. Yeah. All right. It's weird though. It's not feel great. It's so smooth. If I do a hacksquad, I have to reverse band it with a pendulum. I don't. Yeah, see, this is just nice. Yeah. Now, when you're doing this, because I've never done pendulum squads, but it's always hurt. Mm-hmm. Are you pushing against a little part of the pad or against your shoulders? Both. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm trying to do is whatever it takes to feel it right there at the top contraction and right there at the stretch. That's my goal. Okay. Whatever I have to do, whether it's right or not, right now. I'm always avoided pendulum squat, not always avoided hacksquad, because it always hurt. If you reverse band the hacksquad, it probably won't hurt. Yeah. What does it anymore? Good. This is the one that I started using that I was able to get up to, you know, four or five plates. Is that a start track? It looks like a start track. It's a premiere, but it looks like a start track. It looks like an a carry and actually. So I don't have the door selection to go down here. Right. I understand. And that's okay. I would. So if your heel comes up even a millimeter, move your feet up a little bit. The top priority is your heels staying down. You hear that? Doesn't hurt, but what makes a lot of noise? Yeah, like it. All right. I'm just going to do this set of 20 with nothing and see how it feels. I'm going to do 10 to see 10 real. So how it goes. So this isn't exactly a work set. It's like an exploratory warm-up set. That's going to be nice. That's just a nice set of things. That's just a nice set of things. This is so much a nice set of things. That's just so much a nice set of things. And that's just a nice set of things. That's just a nice set of things. That's perfect. That's going to be crazy. So I post you your public tilt. Throw my knees forward for 10 reps, and then I did 10 with my butt back. My heel still came up, but my butt was back. So it's 10 posterior pelvic tilt, then 10 anterior pelvic tilt. I'm the concentric phase. I'm the posterior pelvic tilt, I'm the concentric phase, I'm both of them. And once we start putting weight on it up, put my heels down. But this is warming up my quads and my knees in a non-destructive way. Okay. Let's pause at the bottom and then come up. Okay. If you can control the eccentric, much better. Let's try it. Those look great. I'll go get our stuff. Okay. Okay. Does it take a good? Can you go any deeper? No, it's okay. Okay. Again on this side. Okay. Okay. What kind of ability can I do with that? Understand. Trust me, I'm miss about Olympic weight lifting, squatting, asked to grasp all the time. But now I just won't do it. And I try to force it without injuring myself. But to gain that. It is what it is. Those days are done for me. Yeah, right there and it gets a little bit in tight. I think that has probably at least one. Okay. Okay. So you've got like five, two, two true cices with a posterior pelvic tilt. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's a great. She heals you coming up a little bit if it doesn't hurt that's okay. But if we want glutes, I would move your heel, your feet forward a little bit. There you go. And I wouldn't double pump at the bottom. I would just pause and then squeeze your glutes to drive your stuff up. Yeah. That was pretty good. I would pause a little bit longer. You might want to add ducts. You're going to use the force pushing it glutes to initiate your concentric because your knees are wiggling. That was better. Yeah. Yeah, my back is strong. What are you going to? Hmm? You're still going to 20? This is just a warm-up. Unless it's your work set, then try to go for 12. My lower back is cramping a little bit. You can handle some more adductors. Just make sure to play lateral foot pressure. You should have lateral quads are still engaged. Then when it's lad, add up your ankle. You can handle some more adductors. Just make sure to play lateral foot pressure. You can handle lateral quads are still engaged. Then when it's lad, add up your anilateral quads up. I always kind of torque my feet anyway. But keep your rig toe down all the way. I wasn't only coach for 10 years. I taught a bunch of people that were just train wreck squatters. I finally figured out. I'm trying to play with it to try to find what I'm looking for. But this feels pretty good too. It's just so tight. Something I'll go here. I'm just trying to play lateral foot pressure. I'll go there. I'm just trying to play lateral foot pressure. I'll go there. I'll go there. I'll go there. I got a lot of lateral quad. I both disto and proximal. And I got some gluten ballmen. So we looked at this exactly what I need. Now what I think I need. Something nice and simple. What I used to do for 20 years. Or whatever, 15 years was right the whole time. Just with better equipment. Good amanders. How's that feel? More show. Good. I love the pause at the bottom. You're like loading those. Watching loops. That's for sure. Good. Good show. Who's up next? One, two, three. That's my last work side. I'm just trying to play lateral foot pressure. I'll go there. I'll go there. I'll go there. See you. See you. See you. See you. All right. Now let's see the light curl. Yeah, that's my favorite machine. This one, life, it's funny because this looks fancy as far as I can. I trust you. Oh yeah, because that one's got the dressable cam. This one does too. You're right. We've shown one warm up side. 20, do you bring it? There you go. Just body. Licking extension. Seated light curl machine for the garage. I got rid of that strong body like press. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. Yeah, that's my favorite. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I've got legs going Monday. I've got to be able to recover by Monday for like some Monday. It's a two sets on each of these things. It sounds like bullshit. Do you hear your own coaching or do you have a coach? I have a coach for purposes. I've been doing my own programming. This upcoming season, I'm going to want his help with the programming because I feel I went backwards almost. She's the midsection control better today. Yeah, I'm wearing a bow and I'm wearing a large shirt rather than a medium shirt. You just stretch it all the way. I went to light. It's too light. This stretch it out all the way. I'm going to turn the road to the top, curl, and then squeeze the amishring, and release the slow. Come to the complete top, stretch it, drive the knees up, and come and stretch it. Looks like you got three more. Don't explode up, just squeeze it up. You're right. It's so too light. You get 30 at the end. How did it get 30? What do you have it at? I won 30. That's my two sets. That's your two sets. Jeremy, you got one sets. That's what I got one more set. All right. We're doing two more sets. Two working sets on prematurely. No, it's all just three. We're just doing three. Those are great. I'm going to drive your knees up in the top. Good. It's a good one. It's a good one. Good afternoon. I'm going to throw your back out. I'll snap, drive, and do where to shoot. My instinct is the strive would be the best one, because you can load the stretch position. But you guys know this gym and I do not. So what do you guys like for luggage tension? I use the same hand and the hand. You do the life fitness, that one. All right. Okay, cool. Let's try this one. This is going to be heaviest in the stretch position. The legendary. I'm going to try. This is my favorite. Can you hand me my arm? Red pattern? Thank you. Oh, shoot. How do I get out of this? I love this. I love this. Holes and soundtrack. Jesus. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There you go. There's a little doing. I figured it out. You're going to gobble its blocks instead. What? Are you doing gobble its blocks instead? Are you coming to work? Video belts on my nose. Okay. Now, what why did you not want to lean back on this one? Try. All right. So we're going to keep your feet in. Just lay the back now and you do it. Grab those handles. Got it. And you should feel it right there. Feel better stretching the rightness this way. But you're still getting the same contraction on the knee. Fantastic. You're not Jeremy. You're not Jeremy. I never thought it would put in the rebound on inside out so they look black. That's a lot smarter. So many outfits for ruin because these are blue. I never thought that wearing them and set out. It's just what I take them off. I just approached it. I just approached it. I'm not way they dry these things. They turn inside out and then they dry faster. That's right. There you go. Feel the contraction right there and then the stretch right there. And you can instantly rotate it into it. That's a lot. That's a lot. I don't mean that much. But you can keep it focused right there. That's a lot of pressure. And then stretch. And then use that hand to pull down that handle and that'll keep your butt for coming out. Is that where you're feeling it? I'm actually doing that. I mean, I'm always going to get some VMO. But the G. you see, this leg is come together. But it still has a lot smaller. That's the bad leg, but it's still got better shape. So what's trick is, if you were to pull it up, because that's the detail smaller leg, you pull it that forward. Then when they take a picture, it looks bigger and more detail. Yeah. Yeah, it's got different shape. Not able to get into it. I'm going to do lift up on this. Let me get into it. Thank you. There you go. Perfect. So much weight. We need to take a plate off and go with the quarter. Thank you. We found it. I weigh over solace with those shoe plates. The plate in the half is perfect. Oh. Ah. Ah. It should you want to respite you one leg and then we'll switch back. What? What do you want me to rest? I'll do a leg rather than you going at your right leg Sorry, I did my right leg. Oh you did oh Yeah, I did 12 on this one. I think maybe 10 on this or 9. No, I was dumb with that one I said I don't know what's going on. I got life headed and we're done here. We're doing one my god. I got my own side Cook So you Just Adam!! You are killed!!! So ya, you are just awesome! My Diamond We did it. We're done. It's like empty in here right now. Like this. Not digging the spoons, but the weird Mexican music is better. Oh, this is lightest spot. Not only is this broken, it's too light. There's no way this is going to be heavy enough. This one might work. This one I can usually do three something. This is way more stable than that. When that one was broken, if you need more weight I have a pan. All right, cool. Yeah, well, we probably will. The Line 2 pheno magnetilization system, which makes the front of the mountain paradigms. The horn rerolls are designed and underway over question. It's okay. That's a... I like how this one just spreads the part on its own. Right. You're off to do the handle. You're sick of everything. You're sick of everything. You're sick of everything. When you do feet straight out, it's the hardest. And then these stirps are easier and these stirps are the easiest. So if you've maxed up the machine, just do this with your legs, makes it way heavier. I don't think it's as stable and it's hard to get a good contraction, but if it's just too light, it's like sticking your legs straight out like then. Five, six reps, then switching to one of your feet around, it turns into a whole set. You're so light on. That's the harder one. You went from easy to find. Usually it's a regression, super-sac, not a progression, super-sac. It's trying to stick to matrix. I try to shoot the matrix. Speaking of the matrix, I haven't heard much from what's his name, Andrew T. He's kind of like falling off the radar. Yeah. He was all over the place for years and then he's just gone. You never see him. I noticed he just came back and somebody else's platform. He's not really done. He's not really done. Oh. This is like hiding. I think I'm playing. No, I'm just going to sit down and try to straighten out. That makes me really hard. I'll show you what I'm talking about. So if you do this, I can't even do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just going to risk it. Yeah. I'm just going to risk it. Yeah. I'm just going to make you want. No. I'm just going to risk it. Well, stop with this now. It's time to catch. Yeah. I'm just going to stop with this now. It's time to catch. Yeah. For sure. When you're an user bent, the gas truck doesn't fire really. And it's mostly soluble. This is the best. Now the really good our canyons have pins. And you can load it up with an extra 450 pounds. Yeah. You can't even do that. Don't judge that trick. Don't judge that trick. You're harassmentful. Do that get on! You'll get a admin pineapple in your car's car. Into the dark body. Stay calm and careful. Don't judge the files. Fuck! Stay safe for everyone. Yeah. I'm just going to stand the chase. No! I warning you! I know that I showed you what I wore. Like a guffey. Where did I see the app nimbrler last time? They grabbed a barbell with place on it. Talked. Nah it's good. That's way too much work. equipment for it. Yes, Amanda's the best. Look at you. You're awesome. Yeah, yeah, let's do it over here. Yes, you move so fast too. Oh, making it too easy. This music is so fucking rare. Yeah, two sets. As many as can. So we're trying to do this engage my lats and then I'm trying to do a crunch and just doing the crunch lifts my spine up and the rest of my body just moves with my abs. I feel when you come up all that much you're resting at the top. There you go. You're resting at the top. Yeah, we don't want to rest of the top and do a vacuum too while you're doing it. Do a vacuum the whole time. There you go. Like a caterpillar we're trying to touch the ceiling with our spine. We don't really worry about bending at the hips or the knees. We're just trying to arch her back. I knew that was going to happen. I was about to say watch out for your hair. name just go All he got was a set If found, the 맛s of theFight storm Distance, links to that All floats on the door Wholeektop핑, the source all went Too long, the second Kraft That's what what SET STEPS Huto Black It's a fire I'm gonna do the whole day, how many I'll do it? What I'm doing is something a little bit different. You wanna watch me do a set? Huh? You can't see it back in the middle of the face. My shirt looks like a school. Yeah, show me what you're doing. Not very good. It's like my biggest weakness is vacuum. So basically, he's trying to try and his intestines into shredded beef. That is brutal. Yeah. So all I'm doing is I'm doing a vacuum. I'm stretching it out, engaged my lats, do a vacuum, and then try to stick my spine up as a ceiling. And it'll pull the roller. Yeah. I'm not trying to move the roller through space. I feel like when you come up that much, I feel you rest at the top. That's kind of some time-sharing. So when I'm at the top, I'm fucking max, squeeze the, I'm not resting at the top. Give it a shot like that where you don't come up all the way. And remember, try to do a vacuum and then pull your belly button into the ceiling, arching your back while you do it. So we're not using our hip flexors at all. We're not using our pucks at all. There you go. With that. Oh, that hurts, man. Yeah. It looks like you're doing the last, but you're using just your abs. I don't like that. I like food. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Stick that spine up. Like caterpillar. I'll work on that. Who's up, is it me? I worked on that. All right. This is my last shot then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the key. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not even a single one. That was brutal. Posing time. Plus I want to see Amanda pose. Do you want to figure poses? Yeah. Your figure poses. Oh, I would go back for work. All right. Let's find you can. I mean, your coach comes to Texas so often. Why would you want to pose in person? Everyone forgets that for like 14 years. I taught big kidney posing and figure posing. I could outpost any girl at the girls' poses. This music's lyrics are so intricate. Where is my beverage? You guys know we're straight there. It's behind the hat. Where do you want to go outside? Do you want to? Let's go look and see it the how the light. And front of that mirror is usually where all of the females and males are posing now because that room is so small. In natural competitions, we have this entire stage that we have to do. A routine too. Let's just get check out that life outside because at a certain time of day it might kick ass. I think it's a normal routine. Why would you want to do that? You can even have a routine pose. It's the best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. And the hardest one at all. The best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. It's the best of the way it is. Alright, Amanda. You try to catch my breath. Don't break there. I'm going to do it from the side when I want you to do. So you do in this. I want you to stick your butt out. It's pretty extra chest out. Now keep our legs together. Like that. Pop up on your toes since you should be in heels. Stick your butt out more. There you go. And chest out more. Can you see the difference? See how your feet are getting way wider. We want our feet together. We want to make an hour glass. Like a wine glass with our body. So push those knees together. There you go. Stick your chest out. The butt back there. And then we would rotate out from here. Like that. So push it together. And then rotate out. Just like Dorothy clicking together her ruby slippers. I had my heel. Yeah. That looks better. Alright, and then we're going to transition straight to step out. And then swivel over. That looks good. And then we're going to step out. And stick our butt back. There. Stick your butt back more. Good. Perfect. And then we're transition. So I want you to watch me transition really quick. So for women, for figure, I think this is what looks to his. We'll watch it. Like that. Now like, might be a little dramatic. But if you're all, if if with a pendulum goes to all the way to ultra feminine and you're over here, it'll come in the middle and it'll be perfect. So right there, we're losing those legs. So you want to pinch them together. Interest intro lock your legs. And twist a little bit. Other ones. There you go. Interlock. Twist. Good. See how much ways we're showing. We don't want to show that much waste. There you go. That looks perfect. And then if you don't know what to do with your hands, pinch. You like together like that. Otherwise, we got like fingers. And then the fingers draw the eye to the fingers. Not to the physique. All right. And what did you do? How did you? So what I do say? So from here, I just step out. Okay. That's my transition. That looks a lot better now. We still got that gap in between the knees. We don't want that. That looks better. But back. And we have projector chess forwards. We want to pro-tract our scapula. But internally rotate. That's a success. It goes with those big wedges. So I can stand here. But you got, we got a good run in. Well, I'll jump in and then we'll switch back. Station. That's one of the happy train. So to run my heels, I didn't know we were posing. You didn't want to pose. That's why you didn't bring your heels. But you thought about it. You chose not to. Pro-tractal scapula. Pro-tract that retract. There you go. Arch to back harder and stick a butt out at the same time. There you go. It's too much waste is being shown. There you go. Good. Looks good. The individual poses look good. The transition is going to take time. Because you're letting go of the illusion. It's high and proud as possible. And then. And then. Without. And then we said, now you weren't that dramatic. But if you relax, that's what they see. They don't unsee it. And I'm a had a bad habit of relaxing when I'm on stage in between poses. So that's why I have such an eye for it. So I'm going to keep that up high. The whole time. Especially with figure. As absin is critical for figure. Because that's your silhouette. So for me. For my quarter turns. Which are my worst. Now I'm losing my illusion. But I'm covering my abs when I breathe. So it looks like it's part of the show. It's like do this. But that's just because I need to breathe. If I didn't have to breathe. I was wondering why they. I could just do that. Why they did that. Yeah, you do that. So you can cover your abdomen. Lay breathe. Because you're watching your hands. Not your waist. Because it's moving. It's like the illusion that's on stage. When they go like this and they flip the scarf. And they pull the coin from behind your ear. You don't see them reaching behind your ear. They just use the scarf going there. All right. So from the transitions. And then there's the peck classic version. I don't have the choice. Yeah. I actually slept until eight, twenty ten. The Jesus. I know. It's mostly got that a long time. Do you stop forward? You stop forward. That's what you do. That's why I couldn't figure out what you were doing. Mm-hmm. And then forward again. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now I got. Because I'm used to stepping backwards. You can do that. Whatever works best. And the transitions are personalized. So you're competing classic. Mm-hmm. Is that always been your category? No. No. This is the first time. I've been too 12 for last five years. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How do you say that? All right. I think it's enough pose if I wanted to. So we just had a great lag session with Jeremy and Amanda Beaty who've been friends and clients patients for quite some time. Had a great time, great training partners. He had a really good lag session here at Species and Katie Taxis, which is a subdivision if used in. I really liked the the pendulum squat we used and I was pretty familiar with the other pieces of equipment. The strive lived up to its reputation as being a great lag extension machine. It reminds me a lot of the one that I used at a umbro. And I really liked the pendulum at umbro too. But this is a good pendulum squat. I went really light, but I felt it exactly where I wanted to feel it. And you know, I'm a week post show and a week pre show. I mean, it doesn't need to be an extreme leg workout. And you need to not get hurt. That's like you'll into the workout trying not to get hurt. It'd be like sparring before a billion dollar fight. You don't want to get your nose broken or your shin smashed before the big fight. And then you can't do the fight at the Madison Square Gardens or whatever the Luxor. And then you miss out on the big purse just on the sparring match. You know, it's so training in between shows is sparring. It's not you're not growing any fucking muscle. You're just trying to drive the nutrients of your food into the muscle. So 195 with clothes on and my phone and my pocket and my hat on and my shoes on. That's not a very accurate though. 192. 192 with clothes on without shoes and phone. So the shoes and the phone made up three pounds. That's funny.
