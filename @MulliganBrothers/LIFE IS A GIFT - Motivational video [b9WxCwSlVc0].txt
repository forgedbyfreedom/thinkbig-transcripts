In this world, there is room for everyone and good earth, there is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free of beautiful. I love living, I think best infectious, there is something that you can't fake. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own inner voice. And most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
