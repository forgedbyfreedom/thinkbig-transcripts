Start and then here is life and you have to cross the finish line until you die broke leaving the world a better place than when you found it. For me I start busing my busing my chops and I find this success and then I get to this place right here and this is when HBO bought my show and I thought this was making it. I thought I had made it right there so I backed off. I stopped fighting and I just kind of like chill down and did nothing for a couple of years and then the show aired and it was like over and I looked around and here's where I was. This is where I learned that life does have up to down but you have to keep fighting and busing your ass to go like this. You've got a main tain there. You can never get comfortable because when you get comfortable this is what happens. Comfort this is comfort. Comfort is decline. This is fight. You fight your way up. I couldn't get comfortable. I had to keep fighting. So that's why I'm all the guys and that's why I'm going for it right now. My focus is laser set on the future. I'm not looking back. All I see a bigger scary amount that I will climb and stop it nothing to get to the top of. I didn't start daily vlogging to grill my YouTube channel. I did it as a way to kill all those excuses I used that kept me from making more movies because of every similar impression of my life. Doing the work has always been the thing. It has always been the catalyst that took me from where I am to where I wanted to be. If you want to succeed here you've got a short for work every single day. That took me five years to learn. So to take away you've never made it. With each success must come a newer and more ambitious goal.
