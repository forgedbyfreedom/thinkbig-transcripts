I'm going to be a little bit more nervous. Stop living like you have a thousand years to live. I think you have brainless with you. This is no slogan. This is what I know. You can do more than you are now doing. Most people only want percent of willing to do the work. If you want to think bad enough to God, fight for. To work day and night for. To give up your time, your peace and your sleep. And if you gladly sweat for it in front of it in front of it, and lose all your terror of the opposition for it. And if you simply go after that thing that you want, with all of your capacity, if neither cold poverty, if damage your cold, sickness of pain of body and brain, and keep your way for the thing that you want. You'll get them. See, we can control the thoughts that come in our minds, but we can control the thoughts that we dwell on. This is my time. I own my life. I have to start thinking I have the ability to do this. And I had to mind that I'm unstoppable. There is something in you that can transcend your circumstances. That can transcend the nose and rejections. That can transcend anything that you're going through. And so what we have to do is every day that's tracked ourselves from the negative thoughts that stand on my mind. I'm going to control my own destiny. I'm going to determine what I want to do, what I want out of love. And I'm willing to do what's required to make it become a reality. We've got to be hungry. People that are hungry are willing to do the things they of this world do. In order to have to think tomorrow of us, we won't have people that are hungry. I'm dissonant. People that are hungry are focused. People that are hungry are relentless. Most people just try and survive. Most people when they die, they leave live abilities rather than bill a legacy.
