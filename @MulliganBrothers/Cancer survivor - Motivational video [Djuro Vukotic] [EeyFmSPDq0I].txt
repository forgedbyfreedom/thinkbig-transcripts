I was basically living my life and then the cancer came. I was close to doing suicide. I was imagine being strong. Imagine being that fit. Imagine looking like the way I did. All the stuff that I had worked for, all the suffering that I had gone through to come to where I was. Like I thought I had made it and then I fucking get cancer. The source of my energy, I wanted to show the entire world. I wanted to show every cancer patient on everybody fighting a disease, fighting a situation in life that no matter in which position you are, it is possible to get through and it is possible to succeed in such a matter that you will be impressing the mother fucking shit out of this world. When I made it out, I made it out the chemo. I made it out because I haven't had a easy life throughout my whole life. It's been a battle. It's been a battle to prove people wrong, it's been a battle to prove myself, prove to myself that I am good enough. It's been a battle in the gym to achieve something. I was just trying to prove that I still have a push up, a push up, a push up, a push up, a set up, I don't fucking care. I tried to do it myself. Just to prove that I still have a push up, I still want to come back. I still have to do it myself. So I got out the chemo. But I was left broken. I had the energy and I had the motivation to fight through. So I hope you guys get a little bit out of this. Never give up on life. When you have a burden upon you, that's when it's time to fuel yourself up to sharpen your mind. When you feel that you're losing everything, that's a situation where you're re-relearn a lot in life. We have to adore the negative in life because the negative situations are those that make life interesting. Are those that make life are those that make life a challenge? Negative experiences? Those that are one that are going to create a bad, motherfucker. I hope you guys liked this video. Subscribe, like and see you!
