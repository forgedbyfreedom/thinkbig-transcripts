You have to stop looking out what you don't have and what's not happening for you and start appreciate and like what you do actually have. What do I have to be thankful for and everybody got something to be thankful for. Even a homeless man, if you wanted to he could be like y'all I'm breathing today, you can start very small and out of that it's going to, it's a process but that's how you can get about like a negative space like that. You want me to tell you right now what I realize is like the monetary material, even the success and the things that you put you place it, the importance of never can satisfy you and ever make you happy because they never end. There's no amount of money that will ever make you stop if money is whichever. You can never get enough of that. I realize that it's like it doesn't stop. It keeps calling you. It's like a drug. It's just a thing. It ain't real. It's not real. To me it was real. It was like something spiritual, something like a connection with somebody like a love. It's real. Everybody wants to make it and you might not make it and I said my dad well that depends on what making it is there. I said if I can take a teacher salary during comedy I think that's better to be a teacher and he's not a love. You say if you keep that out of tune I think you should go. He said, then your price in the beginning. It never gets more expensive than the price in the name.
