This whole game is about being a champion of mine, being in control of your own thoughts. Mine is everything. I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. It's a good opportunity to have a done. I was around like 14 or so. It was the first time I was alive that I ever experienced a success that had nothing to do with my pedigree. You know, where I came from, had more and all to do with just my own ability to work really hard. And if I work hard at it, I could achieve something that was in my own hands to do. But if I become my sweetest friend, everyone I know goes away in the end. And you could have with all. This is my life, but this is also me. I will let you down. I will make you. Tremendous power, you know, let just rest in your hands. You stood in the wind with me here. Tremendous power with you. I will, this is from the thorns. Upon my life, chair, full of broken thoughts. I cannot repair. Beneath the stains of time, the feelings, this appeal. You are someone else. I am still right here. But have I become my sweetest friend. Every one I know goes away in the end. And you could have it all. My empire, but true. I will let you down. I will make you. If I could start again, I'll make you know my own way. I will keep myself. I would find a way. What am I doing in my life? Am I living it? I will make you know my own way. I will make you know my own way. Mind is everything. If you don't believe you can do something you can't. I will make you know my own way.
