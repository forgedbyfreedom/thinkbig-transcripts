The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded and the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics. You are all star dust. You couldn't be here, stars had exploded because the elements that carbon, nitrogen, oxygen iron, all the things that matter for evolution weren't created at the beginning of time. They've created the nuclear furnaces of stars and the only way they can get into your body is if the stars were kind enough to explode. We learned in the last 15 years that of course not only do we exist in this universe, it is the universe itself that exists within us. Looking up at the night sky and finding a sense of belonging. The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth, the atoms that make up the human body are traceable to the crucible that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core. Under extreme temperatures and pressures, these stars, the high mass ones, when unstable in their later years, they collapsed and then exploded, scattering. They're enriched guts across the galaxy. Guests made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condensed collapse form the next generation of solar systems, star earth and earth plants and those planets now have ingredients for life itself. So that when I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important and both of those things is that the universe is in us. Many people feel small because they're small and the universe is big, but I feel big. Because my atoms came from those stars. The amazing thing is that every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. You are all star dust. You couldn't be here. The stars hadn't exploded.
