Turn toward the problems you see. You have to engage and turn towards the problems that you see. That is what I want to urge you to do today to turn towards the problems that you see and engage with them. Walk right up to them, look them in the eye and then look yourself in the eye and decide what you're going to do about them. You can't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that. Judge me by how good my good ideas are, not how bad my bad ideas are. You've got to suit up in your armor, you've got to get ready to sound like a total fool. Not having an answer isn't embarrassing, it's an opportunity. Don't be afraid to ask questions. What are you going to be a part of? What is the problem that you will try to solve? Whatever your answer it is not going to be easy. Sometimes your work will hit a dead end. Sometimes your work will be measured in half steps. How lucky are you? I mean, what are the odds that you are the ones who are here today? In the earth's 4.5 billion year run with a hundred billion people who have lived and died, and the seven billion of us here now, here you are. Yes, here you are. A live at a time of potential extinction level events, a time when fewer and fewer people can cause more and more damage. A time when science and technology may not hold all the answers, but are indispensable to any solution. What are the odds that you get to be you? There are potentially trillions of human beings who will someday exist or not who's fate in large part depends on the choices you make. On your ideas, on your grit and persistence and willingness to engage. Because this is a fact, this is not fiction. This improbable thing is actually happening. There's more at stake today than in any story ever told. I hope you'll turn toward the problem of your choosing. I hope you'll drop everything, and I hope you'll solve it. This is your life. This is your moment, and it is all down to you. Ready player one, your game begins. Now.
