I wrote myself a check for $10 million and I gave myself five years or three years maybe and dated at Thanksgiving 1995 and I put it in my wallet and I kept it there and it deteriorated and deteriorated just before Thanksgiving 1995 I found out that I was going to make $10 million on thinking about the government number. I've spent your whole life imagining ghosts worrying about the pathway to the future, but all there will ever be is what's happening here. The decisions we make in this moment which are based in either law and in both of them. So many of us choose our paths out of fear and disguise to practice how they will. What we really want seems to possibly out of reach in ridiculous things to expect so we never dare to ask the universe for it. I'm saying I'm the proof that you can ask the universe for it. My father could have been a great comedian but he didn't believe that that was possible for him and so he made a conservative choice. Instead, he got a safe job as an accountant and when I was 12 years old he was let go from that safe job and our family had to do whatever we could to survive. I learned many great lessons from my father, not the least of which was that you can fail at what you don't want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love.
