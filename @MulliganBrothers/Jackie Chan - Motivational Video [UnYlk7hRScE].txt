I never give up. I never give up. I go my own way, risk my life. So this way I'll always tell the people not because one thing is for them. You never give up. Never give up. Never give up. One day you will see. When you see the famous people wow so successful, you don't know behind the storm. How tough they are, what they are, when people wow taking the move so good. When everybody sleep, I still in the half club, in the mirror. Practicing. Practicing. And four club, six or six or six, on the set. Then you suddenly do something, wow, very beautiful. Oh yeah, go back, train again. Okay, this is Nick head, that's a sneak mouth, that's a sneak tongue. Okay, you create more things. Every day when I'm on the set, I just do the best I can. Every move I risk my life to do the things, not for the fans. If for myself, because after do the best I can, they are lately becoming my train mouth, which I give risks to life. Even today I look at the old film, look at myself. Sometimes, we are smart, I'm glad. Even I know I get hurt, I'm so happy, I did it. You might get hurt, you learn in a piano, you learn in a martial art. Learn in the level you can. They see it, I just do it. 10 years later, now for ever, the things you learn, or the success I have for ever. Don't worry, crap, one day, two of them will be young. Never give up, never give up, one day you will see.
