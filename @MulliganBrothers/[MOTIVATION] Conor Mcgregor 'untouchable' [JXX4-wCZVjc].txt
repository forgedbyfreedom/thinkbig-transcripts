I've been on the end of many defeats in my life and I've rosepacks on it. I will not shy away from it, I will not make excuses for it, I will assess it and come back. I will just shoot two years in the gym, two, two, whens, two losses, two life. I just realized that if you say it to yourself and you look yourself in the eye and look yourself in the mirror and truly, truly believe that not a man alive can beat you and that that is the way it is and just true. True, I was in the gym and preparation, I feel that I am on touchable right now. Don't believe you're on the hook and you're going to be a well-keep camp and the performance will come and it means. If we are obsessed with something and we truly pursue our passion with everything we have, regardless of anything else, if you are obsessed, work hard, put in the time, you will succeed and this is hard work, this is an obsession. Everything can be hard work. Hard work pairs, so take notes, nobody looks harder than me inside the acting on outside the acting on IMA, book course. August 20th, I get my revenge and I look forward to it. Once the pre-pantition carries conviction. I look prove a people wrong, I prove a my support right, I just want to tip out at the end of the day and this is all funny games to me, I love it, I love my job. It's human nature, some people will sit and take positivity from that, they will look at that and take inspiration and inspire it, it will inspire it and to go and push for that, orders will shallow and critique and be negative towards it. The only thing that showed those people will stay where they are, the people who take inspiration from it will rise up and I'm also a one day experience that like so. This is this is human nature, some go away, some go to the labor. I'm staying, I'm setting up to be the greatest of all time, I am walking towards it and I will go down as the greatest of all time.
