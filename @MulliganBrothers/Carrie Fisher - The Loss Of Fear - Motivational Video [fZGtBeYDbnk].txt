When you're in the thick of it which I have been a few times, there is nothing that compares to that. One time I could not sleep and I went to the hospital and they wouldn't give me anything. It took me off all my medicine because I was having an allergic reaction. I stayed awake for five days. That's how they torture people. And I became psychotic. That was very, very bad. That was terrifying. You know, I've seen people, you know, the take all the charm and romance out of self-pity. I'm not really interested in finding it tragic. So anything after that, I've done harm before. Now it's going to be very tough. People talk about experiences where their friend had their arm blown off and said, Could you get my watch? What man has done? Man can do. But what's the choice? You know, you're just going to plow through it. It's really hard. But then the point is to find the funny thing in the hard thing. My abilities are my assets. But I claim it. If I can claim it, it's mine. That you're weak things in a strong voice. I've been able to get through this stuff. And I've been able to, I can't overcome it. But I can use it instead of it. It's, I have problems, problems don't have me. You know, I am, I'm very, I'm not afraid of anything. And that would not be so if I hadn't had to deal with all that. I started a phrase, but I'm not afraid of you.
