I don't know many people actually worth knowing who don't have a mind that sometimes leads them astray. I think most of the world's advances in creativity and invention and in almost anything have been done by little spurts of madness. I tried to end my life and remember the kid. We're all scared inside. We may all walk big and those guys who walk along look really cocky. They're the ones who are most scared. No matter what happens to you in your past, you are not your past and what the resources you've gained from it. That is the basis for all change. Because the worship of life is, if you've survived the works of the words, you've made the biggest mistakes and they're still breathing. You can learn from the napioz muscle. Sometimes life does seem unsupportable. Not for any logic reason, that's the point. You can't talk someone out of finding life I'm pleasant by saying, look what you've got. But it's not about that. But you can perhaps at least say, look what it will do to other people. When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. And you won't find so much power, so much passion, and so much internal fortitude from your past. You know, we all think we've just missed out on the secrets of life. The wonderful secret is that we're all equally afraid and uncertain, and that that isn't a bad thing. Greatness is a part of you better act like it. It's an integral part of life. It's a part of life.
