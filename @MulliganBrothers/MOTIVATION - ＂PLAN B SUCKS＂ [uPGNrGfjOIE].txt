So, right down everything you want and be a specific as you can, right? I want you to read it every morning before you do anything and read it every night before you go to bed. I don't care how long it takes. If you do this, you are obeying a prince and that's how you get what you want. When you see transition, it really starts to happen when you really want to transition and something to master. There's no limits. Don't let the world able put the limits on you. You can do anything you want to do. But make sure if you have a vision, make sure the vision is written. Make sure you have something to actually chase and not just hope and wish them. Put your plans together and be worked to plan. Don't work somebody else's plan. You have to create your own brand yourself and your brand is whatever you feel like doing whatever you are, his passion about chasing. Right now you're getting it, right? You know, let your subconscious mind be the leader of your new arms and trust it because what you think is your subconscious mind also what you're going to live. Right? Make it plan so you can see it so you can vision and see where you want to go and your next step. You got to have a plan. Everybody's got a dream, everybody's got a goal, what's the plan? Your plans got to be clear, concise, compelling, consistent and committed. You've got to have a plan. And when you're trying to do something that you're truly passionate about, there is no plan to be. You've got to have a plan. I mean, Michael Jordan was six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls because he was committed to plan A, not plan B. Oprah went for it. He came to Queen of all media because she was committed to plan A, not plan B. Barack Obama is sitting in the White House because he was committed to plan A, not plan B, plan B, plan B sucks.
