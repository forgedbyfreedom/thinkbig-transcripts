Make a choice. Like you just decide what is going to be who you're going to be, how you're going to do it. Just decide. What I am is a guy who's got 19 plus years of the word no. You know, people just see the last five years. Like I've got 19 years of no. Not good enough. You don't get the part. No. I represent hard work, determination, motivation. I think without without a doubt. If anything goes by watching me, it's simply an example of hard work pays off. That's it. What you put into your craft, you can get out to it if you put 110% into it. And I'm just an example of that. And today's time, it's literally just about you realizing your own potential and being creative within your own potential. Oh, this is what I can do. So I need to master this business as a comedian. What can I do to set the bar and another love. What can I do for our generation for people to go, oh my god. Holy shit. Thank you. Before I go, I'm a hand on a fucking note from the heart right now. And I'm a child not to be a bitch. They get emotional up here. Do I am now one of you to fucking perform as a stand up comedian. And Madison fucking square garden. Hey. Listen to me. Listen to me. You have no idea the fucking feelings that I have on to my body right now, man. This is so fucking dream come true. Hey. This is a fucking dream come true, man. Thank you for being loyal. Thank you for growing me. Thank you for fucking enjoying me. My name is Krabahar. I love you.
