When you step into your fears and continue to push yourself to go on, something happens for you. It will enable you to transcend yourself. If you don't develop the courage to do that which has been given you to do and you spend a lot of time going around trying to convince other people, trying to get their approval, what will happen is that you will lose your nerve. And other people will convince you that what you are doing doesn't have any value and you'll give up on your dreams. Do not go with a path may lead, but go where there's no path and leave a trail. Stop living your life like you have a thousand years to live. If you live you either hit a day and you're gone today. If there's something that you want to do and you can't do at all at one time, you do just a little bit of it. A friend of mine, Bobby Kerr, used to be a roommate. Bobby wanted to go into the area of public relations. He loved working with the public. Young lady, you are to marry named Clarisse. Bobby was a great procrastinator. Pretty soon the job where Bobby worked a transfer into another location. He went out to celebrate with the people on that new job site and Bobby suffered a massive heart attack and died. Bobby didn't drink and didn't smoke was on the 40 and he died. Ask your question, how much time do you have left? How much time do you have left? When you start thinking about that we don't know. We don't know Bobby took all the greatness and all of the talent and all of his abilities to his grave with him. Stop wasting valuable time knowing that if we begin to live our lives as if each day we're our last allies will take all. Take on a whole new meaning. Most of us don't use the stuff that we have brought into the universe.
