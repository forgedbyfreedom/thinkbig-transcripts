The mind is the battleground. It is the place where the greatest conflict is. There are more people in this room having trouble in their mind than there are people having trouble in their finances. The struggle is in your mind. This is why we have people who go to bad tired and wake up tired. It is the day to ask that you wake up still time. The reason you wake up tired is that you got sleep but you didn't get rest. Your mind has been in trouble all night long. You've been listening to your sleep. I've never walked up in your bed. What's with the bed at all? Talk to me like you really don't fight because your mind has not rested. Your body went to sleep but your mind is still tired of it all for you. Your mind is the battleground. The tension about it telling the universe after your mind. Out to worry, you didn't have to stress you didn't have to break it down. Out to make you quit. Out to make you think that you can't get up. Out to make you feel up on your dreams. The war fairy is in your mind. It's not in your checkbook. It's not in your savings account. It's not on your job. The fight that you got to fight is in your mind. And if you whip it in your hands, you get whip it in your checkbook. You can whip it all, get it soft. You can whip it out of your head. Shut up, let's get out of front. Tell what you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beaten on your craft. Make a choice, right? You just decide what is going to be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do. Just decide. And you deserve your hand. I'm here who says you can't. I'm going to do it right. But first, I've got to start. Before anybody else in the world believes it's because you have to believe it. Because you have to have a plan to be going to destroy your plan. Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.
