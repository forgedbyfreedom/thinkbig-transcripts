Mike Tyson is only 16 years old. I feel I was born the fight because I have no other interest in anything else. Anybody the fighter and their own right, your fighter, I'm a fighter. But everybody don't get up every morning and run. Everybody don't go to the gym every morning. Nobody don't have enough discipline to wait in the locker room for two hours or three hours. Then go in the ring and do what they've been taught all year than the gym. That's what separates the champion on the media or the fighter. I don't believe in town. Well some people have town that's good, it helps me have town. As long as you have a lot of determination and willpower, that's all you need. And you really have to have the will to win. Everyone says that we shall win, we shall win, we shall win, we shall win. The people, the hundreds of people that wish they were my shoes, don't know the tent of it. It's the one on the sacrifice. That's the plan. We want them to hate to do it like you've made. And they're always testing this. For us and yourself, so about them. We're going to be the best of the best. So, success is the general goal of both sacrifice. Every man must believe in himself. You must have the confidence and you must go mad at what the situation is. You must face the problems.
