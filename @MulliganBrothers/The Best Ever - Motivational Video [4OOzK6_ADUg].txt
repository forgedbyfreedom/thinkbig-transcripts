I keep my eyes on the cross. You want to be always pushing beyond what you're comfortable with. Don't wait to be asked because nobody's going to ask you. And don't wait for the perfect conditions because they'll never be perfect. Did nobody get in there and put the gloves on for you. If nobody got in there on that road and run miles and miles for me, nobody took the broken ribs. Nobody took the bloody nose. I did it all. I've dedicated myself to my craft and I bust my hands. There's never personal for me. There's always business. And you just have to take the plan. I never overlook no one. I train for every fighter the same way. I push myself. I believe in my skills and I believe in my talent. There's always a way if you're committed. Just gotta keep changing your brunt. You got fighters. Then maybe faster than me. You got fighters. You may hit already. But you don't have no fighting that can make adjustments like me. You don't have fighters that can be on my level mentally. There's never personal for me. There's always business. You get to where you're trying to get to. I stand focus. Stand on a parallel path. My thing is this. I keep my eyes on a prize. I never focus on things outside of me. My focus is the guy that's in front of me. I always had a dream. And my dream was to be the best. No matter when I have this. When it comes down to boxing, I'm the best at this. Right now, if you believe you're the best in the world. I'll tell them they're best in the world. I'll tell them they're best in the world.
