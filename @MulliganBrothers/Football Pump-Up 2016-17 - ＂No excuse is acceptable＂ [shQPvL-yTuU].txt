Great moments. Our born and great opportunity. And that's what you have here. That's what you've earned here tonight. One game. If we played them ten times, they might win 9. Not this game. Tonight, tonight, we stay with them. And we shut them down because we can. The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams that want to do things. Now that you have naturally, skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beaten on your craft. People that are hungry are unstoppable, Mr. Brown. People that are hungry, no excuse is acceptable. Go out and face to music young men. And don't forget, stay hungry. Are you willing to keep working on it? You will and are willing to realize that you have not done your best stuff yet that you can better your best. Just everything you've got to be. Not because of the soap. The only thing that I see that is distinctly different about me is I'm not afraid to die in my trip. You might have more talent than me. You might be smarter than me. There's two things. You're getting off first. You are going to die. It's really that simple. It's about winning 101 battles. Taste and fight!
