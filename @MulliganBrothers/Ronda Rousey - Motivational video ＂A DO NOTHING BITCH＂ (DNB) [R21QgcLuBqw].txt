And my family, we were always told that we were meant to be something extraordinary. I have this one term for the kind of woman that my mother raised me to not be and I call it a do nothing bitch or I call it a D&B a lot of the time. I kind of take that just like just tries to be pretty and be taking care of by somebody else. I'm scared to death a failure and I'm so scared to lose a way more than any of these other girls and it's the kind of thing that keeps me up a night and it wakes me up in the morning. People like to say that my body looks masculine or something like that. I'm just like listen. Just because my body was developed for purpose I've been fucking millionaires doesn't mean it's masculine. I think it's definitely badass as fuck because there's not a single muscle on my body isn't for a purpose because I'm not a do nothing bitch.
