People die every day, Frankie. My pen floor was washing dishes. You know what the last thought is? I never got my shot. You're she dies today. You know what the last thought will be? I think I did alright. I don't need to cover this black as the picture-poded bulb. I think whatever the odd there may be from my uncomfortable soul. And the fellow collective circumstance, I have not cried aloud. I've never been to the place where I was born. I've never been to the place where I was born. I've never been to the place where I was born. I've never been to the place where I was born. I've not cried aloud. And that the blood of the things of fate, My head is bloody, but unbouled. Beyond this place of wrath and tears, The wounds but the shadow of the shade. Yet the minutes of the years find as it shelf I need, Unfraid. Someone asked me once and you were about to do it. What would you do if you weren't an actor? If you didn't make it as an actor. I have no idea. I would act somewhere. Maybe I'd be driving the can. Maybe I'm working somebody's yard. Whatever I'm doing, I will act. Because I'll die if I don't. You do it because you have to do it. If you spend 20 years waiting tables at night if you were right, you're righting. And it's the same thing with any discipline. Payles, pay. I don't care what else they have to do to put food on their table or pay the man. They're paying. And I think that's the same way all around. Right as right, paying as paying. Act as act. Matters not how straight the gate and how punishments charge the scroll. I am the master of my beat. I am the captain of my soul.
