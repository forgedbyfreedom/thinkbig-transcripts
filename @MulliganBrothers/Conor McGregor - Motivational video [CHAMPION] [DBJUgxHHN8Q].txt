I'm an upcoming fighter and without a doubt you will see me on the UFC and the Indian near future without a doubt. I'm a professional MMA fighter with a record of four and one. Just believe in yourself, believe that you're better than everyone else. Believe in yourself and be cocking and be confident in them. Believe in humble, train hard. Again keep a living, keep training, keep trying to learn every day. For me, what's unhealthy is living in one healthy life. To me, what's unhealthy is getting up. I go through the same day every day I like, nine to five and then office are in there. Remember that that's unhealthy. That beats your mind. I don't work. I look what I do and that's what I'm doing what I love. My dream is to be number one pretty much my girl is number one MMA. I want to have a better way of building, I want that lightweight build. That's my goal. It will happen and I'll let you know when it happens. On the full computer! I'm going to be a good one. In a minute, two things are planned from all from these past seven months. Number one is the hard work pays off. Number two is that dreams come true. That's what's happening. I will be where I want to be. I'm 100% confident that I will make it to the top. I have the skills, I have the dedication. It will happen. I'll let you know when it happens. For precision beats power and time and beat speed. I knew he would overextend and I knew I'd catch him. If you can see it here, and you have the courage and of the speak it, it will happen. I see these shots, I see these sequences, and I don't shy away from them. A lot of the times people believe in certain things but they keep themself. You truly believe in it. If you become vulgar with it, you are creating that law of attraction and it will become reality. It just goes without a hard work and dedication. Really those pay off.
