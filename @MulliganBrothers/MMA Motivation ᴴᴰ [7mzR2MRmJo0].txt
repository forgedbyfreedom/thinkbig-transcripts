Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our life, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There was nothing enlightened about shrinkings in that. Other people won't feel insecure around you. People all in to shine as children. It's not just as some of us is in heaven.points, windows, windows, windows, windows, doors.O Ruffers will fly on the streets. Who flyed without fault to serve the kingdom in dawn. Our 2008 sound transformations on their mind. It's a more important promise. What would you get by today? We get one opportunity in life. One chance in life to do whatever you're going to do. To lay your families in order to make whatever more you want to make. Whatever legacy you're going to leave, leave your legacy. And it's found to ever. When the law says come a dad would do us. But effort, nobody can judge every. Because effort is between you and you. Everything I've got to do with nobody else. Because everyday is a new day. Every moment is a no-mo. So now you've got to go on and show me the other different creatures. Now that I've lost five minutes ago. Because I'm pissed off for grace. Because I'm doing pissed off for greatness. That means you're okay with being with me. And no man in your case will be in dispaces.
