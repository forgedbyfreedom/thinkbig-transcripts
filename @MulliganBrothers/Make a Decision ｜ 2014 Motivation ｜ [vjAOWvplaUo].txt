You are running out of time. The clock is ticking. The lens of people just sitting out of their body. Your life is miserable right now. You are unhappy right now. You wish you could get a new life. You do whatever it took to get a new life. You don't tell your don't cause money because the kid didn't have money when I did it. You know what I did to get where I am right now. I made a decision. You want some different listen to me all you got to do is make a decision. I said, you don't know I was telling you how. You keep telling yourself you got time and watch what happened now. You got to get what I'm telling you. Being average is dangerous. I mean this fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. Your playing small does not serve the world. There was nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. Don't be all you got to do is make a decision. That's it. I want to be the greatest of all time. That's my motivation. Fear is not real. You are running out of time. You are going to go through the battle and you are going to go through the war. You want to get the right to stop you. If you are right to listen to your gun, you don't know what is right to say now. If you are going to be the only way you want to be a doge, you want to do. You want to run into your own time. When you like that lion, if I want to ride, you don't ride, if I want to ride, they don't eat. Sponsored, never retreat. Sponsored never surrender. Break this of the army. I'm not new in forations. I'm the guy you took care of. You are my father. I'm not going to come to your high school and tell you you can make it happen. Break this of the army. You better act like that. That lion gets up and cares the shape and everyone runs like a dream. Eat everything is bad. Does everyone's in the wild? Lion has to show the jackals. Yes. You got to find something with him and that's got to push you and that's got to elevate you. And that's got to drive you and that's got to move you and when you find out what you're right here and your why got to be pretty new. When you find your why, you don't hit you anymore. When you find your why, you find a way to make it happen. I want to be the greatest of all time. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to do anything. So it's the call of action. Get off the phone, get off the video. Whatever you're doing, get off whatever you're doing. Whatever you're having watching is computer. Get off of it and do a good thing. Make a decision. I want you to make a couple of decisions for me. I want you to make a decision at a year from now. Besides, if you don't make the sake, write it down and see the papers. Speak it out. This is where I'm going to be a year from now. Make a decision. Still me all you gotta do is make a decision. That's it.
