You are the star of your show. You are the director. You're writing the script. Stop giving up. Don't let your dreams be dreams. You should get the point or anyone else would quit. If you want something out of life, if you want to change yourself, if you want to cross something, if there's some goal that you want to reach, that is really not easy as some people will make us feel. You should get the point or anyone else. That living a dream, changing your behaviors, overcoming negative habits, it's challenging. It's hard. The word of the characteristics of the qualities of people that are hungry, what will it take for me to get some of the things that I want? And being hungry for those things, you've got to stand up inside yourself sometimes and say, Shut up! You can't do this. You don't have everything it takes us shut up! You've got to stand up to that voice. You are the star of your show. You are the director. You're writing the script. And you will determine whether your life is a smash off his hip or flop. You determine that. You've got to sell yourself every day on your abilities, on what you're doing, on the goal that you want to reach. You've got to sell yourself every day, every day, every day. It will manifest itself in what you're doing, whatever we have right now, whatever we're demonstrating in our lives, is result of what we believe subconsciously that we deserve. You have got to convince yourself every day. You can learn all the techniques in the world if you don't believe in yourself. It won't happen for you. And as you convince you, as you sell yourself every day, every day, every day. You will begin to see a difference in the things that you're doing. Selling yourself on your ability to perform in your heart, to achieve a certain objective, telling yourself every day, here I go again. And I've got what it takes. This is my day, and nothing out here is going to stop me. It's a long way in front of me. What would you get for today? It takes courage to act, part of being hungry when you've been defeated. It takes courage to start over again. We get one out of the two in their life, once you have your life to do it, you're going to lay your families and make whatever you want, or whatever legacy you're going to leave, leave your legs. It's far too young. You've got to stand up inside yourself sometimes and say, Shutter, this is my day, and nothing out here is going to stop me. Stop wasting valuable time. Knowing that if we begin to live our lives, as if each day we're our last, our lives will take off. Take on a whole new, new expression. Knowing each moment that we are blessed with. You are the star of your show. You are the director. You are writing the script. You are the star of your show.
