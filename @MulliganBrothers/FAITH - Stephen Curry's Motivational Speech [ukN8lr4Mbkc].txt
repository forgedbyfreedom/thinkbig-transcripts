That's all about faith passion. Obviously the drive with the guys that I've been around and the guys that surround me every single day. But a part of that is having the will to succeed. You know, knowing that you put the work in and have the confidence to let it show. When I tell people is just be the best version of yourself and anything that you do. You don't have to live anybody else's story. Sometimes people make it seem like you have to have certain prerequisites or crazy life story in order to be successful in this world. But the truth is you really don't. It doesn't matter where you come from, but what you have or don't have what you lack, what you have too much of, but all you need to have is faith in God and undying passion for what you do. And what you choose to do in this life. And a relentless drive and the will to do whatever it takes to be successful. And whatever you put your mind to, make sure you live in the moment and work your butt off every single day. And I hope I inspire people all around the world to just be themselves, be humble and be grateful for all the blessings in your life. And I'm truly honored to be here every year, every year this year. Thank you very much. I was always the smallest kid of my team. When it comes to basketball, I was always the smallest kid of my team. You know, everything happens for reason. There's a story to everything. And if you take time to realize what your dream is, and what you really want in life and the matter what it is, what it supports, what it's, you know, the fields. You have to realize that there's always work to do. And you want to be the hardest working person and whatever you do. And you put yourself in position to be successful. And you have to have a passion about what you do. And basketball is mine. And that's what's carried me to this point. And I'm really proud of you.
