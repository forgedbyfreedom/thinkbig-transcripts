I have not allowed my disability to stop me doing most things. At the age of 21, I was told I had an irrevocable disease that would kill me in two or three years. My model is there or no boundaries. So remember to look at the stars and not down at your feet. Here's a guy who cannot walk, who cannot speak, who cannot move independently. And yet somehow he still found a way. I feel a sense of achievement that I have managed to make these contributions despite having a OS. In my life, I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed, it has probably given me more times than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe and we are making good progress. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.
