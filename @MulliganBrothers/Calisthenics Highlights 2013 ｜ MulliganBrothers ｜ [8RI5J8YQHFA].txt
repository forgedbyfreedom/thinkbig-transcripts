Let me tell you something. It's a more rewarding place. What would you get by today? Forget everything else. Forget everything else. Forget that was any sunlight left. What would you spend today? Thank you. When my mind's sleeping now. Did you bring me some stones to drink? Strain up pulses with them close outside. I'm sad for when my belly will light up. When my little belly speaks to my bears. There beneath my bed. And I wish I had a wish. And you whispered to the rest. And then I'm a skirt since I'm something. And I'm going to go. And I'm going to close the other cross. All of it close. Let me tell you something. When my little body is rising in. My balance here and I can't believe. I'm the only one who's dying. If you want to stay in peace. Only one who will believe. Only one who will believe. When my little body is rising in. When my little body is rising in. My little body is rising in. My little legs are turning away. If you want to stay in peace. And I'm going to close the other cross. All of it close. All of it close. All of it close. All of it close. And I'm going to close the other cross. I'm going to close it, but your hearts are too old. But I might see it all might be the наш. Won't you love, tonight? 본래 reborn like star protected fromDon't let thething appear, hold me around. We'll meet again in the Mantle. And he can be mine.
