I believe desire and will to win is everything. I don't know why I'm like I am but my but's always burning. There's always something say art, dad, gummature is supposed to go far. Art, dad gummature is supposed to be somebody you're supposed to make a difference with your lie. What is the 500,000 dollar-year person do? The 50,000 dollar-year person doesn't do. You're looking outside instead of those two individuals everything seems to be the same. They both are the same sex, they both are the same age, they have the same training, the same positions, the same contract, the same friends, men of theirs, they both are successful, they work hard, they're good family people, make tough commitments. But what's the difference? What is the 500,000 dollar-year person do? The 50,000 dollar-year person doesn't do. He pays the price a little bit more. He works hard a little bit more. He's loyal to the cut in a little bit more. He leaves a little bit more. He makes money a little bit more. He says money a little bit more. If you want to win in the United States, you got to be tough. And you can't quit. It's folks if you want to win in business, you got to be a leader. Leadership is everything. You show me anything in the United States that win. I'll show you a leader at work. I thought at one time in my life you had to be smart to win. And I found two things out about smart people. I think it's almost impossible for a smart person to win in business in America today. Because I find smart people spend their whole lifetime figuring things out. They always trying to figure out an easier way in a quicker way. And another thing I found out about smart people is they just don't get around to do anything. They say something like art, we have everybody said, Well, he can't do it. And somebody like that can't do it. But he does it. See folks I want you to know almost everybody in America almost doesn't up to win. They almost get there. They almost go over the hump. They almost have it going. They almost in everything they do. Almost is a way of life to almost everybody in America. But the winners do it. What do they do? They do whatever it takes to get the job done. They do it. And do it. And do it. And do it. And do it. And do it. Until the job gets done. And then they talk about how great it is to be somebody they're proud of. If you want to become somebody, do it. If you want to go and finish for yourself, do it. If you want to become financial independent, do it. I hear too much talking these United States. Everybody can talk a good game. We need people in America who can do it. They've got to go all over this country with AOEs and I have people say, are you? You can't all mean wonderful. Just do it. All right, I can't hear. This is my last stop. I'm going to win now. Super duper. Just do it. All right. If I could just have one good month and get to ball going, I know I could make it big. Super. Just do it. All right. If I could just pay all this dead, I could really go. Great. Just do it. All right. If I could just say on the house. Do it. All right. But how's the day selling? Do it anyway. All right. I'm not making any money. What can I do? You just do it. Let's do what all you do it and do it and do it. All right. Get down on the windows contest. Super duper. Just do it. All right. I'm over the hunt now. Watch my smoke. Grains. Just do it. All right. I want to make it so bad. I'm tasting what I do. You just do it. All right. I'm over the hunt. Do it. All right. All right.
