So this stuff you got to understand about training is not just the body that that works. There's an integration of fine, spirit and body at play. There's a threshold that you have the cross in order to access the power of the mind and the spirit in your training. When you cross that threshold, you're like breaking through a fortress, with in that fortress, there are tools of unknown founders that instantly turn you into a brand new person. The type of person, everyone who knows just facts, can appreciate it's found in one place. There's a single opportunity in your workout to access this game to move through and transcend yourself. It's balancing the life of breath. It's called a transcendent breath. Everything that you've done up to this point leads to this single sweet spot. It is here that you grow strong. It is here that championed your form. It is here that you become the strongest person yourself. Everything else is just a warm-up. You can't be in the flesh when you approach that transcendent breath. That last breath that your body doesn't want to do, but your mind and your spirit are already done. When you cross that threshold, not only is your body growth stronger because you did that last breath, transcendent your form again. You become a brand new person.
