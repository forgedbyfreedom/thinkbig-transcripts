How about you everybody in here? Has story? Something that you did not pick. Now this is going to be a little difficult, so stay with me. You are born into a fight! That you didn't even get to choose! You're calling must eclipse your circumstance. Or you will go back to being who you were. Whenever what is in front of you becomes more important than what was behind you, you will always get away. The struggle of it your mind! What would you spend today? Stay here about. Leave your legacy! You will be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one. It is not about how well you fight! It is about what you are fighting for!
