Yeah loves you. Yourタ fash Fear is not real. The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future. It is a product of our imagination, causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist. Danger is very real, but fear is a choice. You're all telling ourselves the story. And that A-Montiation. Who's once cut from his high school team? $25,000 to get this thing off the whole gaming fire grant. When I was a Michigan State, two of my pro-ratch, I didn't get a ton of had no budget. But I didn't need a budget. I had a dream. I didn't really know how to presently, never pay. You can say it to me. In case we're going to help your poor craft, but it's been so soon for us to presently, never pay. And I've never quit. I've never done it but why? So there was a hard dream in the first place to take care of the kids from the D. It was my dream. It was my dream. I was expecting to do, I don't expect people to believe in my dream. Like I believe in my dream. And the problem is coming up. It's too long for my own support. Your dream is your life. It'll join you, dominate it, just for it. Like two athletes ever had. I don't know when you were dying. It's your dream. If you want to have it, you should've brought up a mission. Have it. If you want to have it, rise and rise. If you want to have it, you'll have to do what I do. And that's good up to see your clock. You're not sure. If you're going to have it, then you're going to have it. If you're going to have it, you're going to have it. Get your butt up and fire. So you can get to be destroyed by six. That means you'll have to speak to the chief and you won't have that glash. We've got all the energy in the world. Because it's my dad. Just my mum and tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow. Ain't no spare thing that's tomorrow. He'll be back today.
