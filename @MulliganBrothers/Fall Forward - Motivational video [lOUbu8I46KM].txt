If I'm going to fall, I don't want to fall back on anything except my faith. I want to fall forward. I figured at least this way I'll see what I'm going to hit. I'm going to fall forward. Most people allow their fear of failure, 80% allow their fear of failure, not the way they're in their emergency scene. When you're willing to fail again and again and again, you make up your mind to become no matter what person. Then that will then give birth to a part of yourself, which you don't know right now. By putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation, sometimes life will force you to become courageous. Reggie Jackson took out 2600 times and he's created the most in the history of Facebook, but you don't hear about the strikeouts. People remember about home rounds. Full full weight. Thomas Edison conducted 1,000 failed experiments. Because the 1,000 in first was the light bulb. Full full. I didn't quit. I didn't fall back. I walked out of there to prepare for the next audition. And the next audition and the next audition. I prayed. I prayed. And I prayed. But I continued to fail. And failed. To get something you never had. You have to do something you never did. You will fail at some point in your life. Accept it. You will lose. You will embarrass yourself. You will suck at something. You've got to take risks. And I'm sure you'll probably have heard that before.
