Many people have this idea, I want to achieve something great or be somebody great and they neglect the step that leads to greatness, they don't honour this step at this moment because they have this idea of some future moment where they are going to be great. Put your head down and work with pride on whatever is in front of you, you never know where you might end up. Just be aware the next worthy pursuit will probably appear in your periphery. Your life is a journey, you know you want to go from here to there, whether you're going to get there, we don't know maybe on the way you branch out to somewhere else but at least you have a certain direction, it's good to have some direction in your life. But while you are traveling, if the destination takes up most of your attention and you're continuously focusing on your your misalternation, you really can't enjoy the journey anymore. This way your life is the journey, the arriving is relatively rare. The rest is the journey and if you can't enjoy the journey which means this tap you're taking at this moment is really the most important thing. Because that's ultimately your whole life consists of the tap you're taking at this moment that is never anything else. Our eyes are not viewers, they're also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time. Fear is writing that script. With alignment, with where you are right now to be totally where you are and whatever you are doing now to be totally enjoying it. No matter what it is, to be true to life by being true to this moment. So confidently in the direction of your dreams and live the life that you've imagined.
