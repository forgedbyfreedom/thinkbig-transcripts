We can easily say congrats to the cake but quite honestly that's getting a bit boring. This is LeBron James we're talking about the best basketball player on a planet. It's just plain and simple. 277 and 8. This is what this man averaged this year. This is after winning the MVP last year. After winning 3 previous league MVP he's just been absolutely dominant on the Miami and you know something else too. He deserves even more credit consideration. For the role of cancer cry. You're free to cover one win. Yes! And you're a ball, James! You have to believe it. You have to believe it has a bit of role. But then the big win is the point when a 1.27 straight football body you think that is. It would happen if the big win is the LeBron James. Instead of favor to repeat this world championship, LeBron James thinks that is the biggest win because no LeBron James. It doesn't matter what you're doing this place. It doesn't matter what players you look at. But then you're having the rain, holding the car, and LeBron James really doesn't matter. We can talk about the total macro. Anybody who stands to you, it was LeBron James. The only success is for the only wish you man amiss. And if it was not, we'd love to know who that person was. I hope I could pull it straight. I wouldn't like the speed of sound. We can keep on the ground. Can't stay in one place. Keep moving like a bridge. Like a bridge. We can keep on the ground. Can't stay in one place. I think this is the way to sound together. Keep moving like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge. Like a bridge.
