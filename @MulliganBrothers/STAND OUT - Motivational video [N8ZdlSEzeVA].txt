I think I should be no fear. I just should be no fear. I think that's just always remember being pummeled by fear early on. I feel like I could have just got rid of that fear earlier. This might have been a little bit easier. I just don't give a fuck, that's gonna the best thing that did. My future light is just working. It's that great job. Everybody else does. The time is now. The time is now to express and for people to believe in themselves. The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world shun people for being great, for being a bright color, for standing out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. I refuse to follow those rules that society has set up in the way that they control people with low self-esteem. It's crazy that we live in a world that if you're super positive and super creative, then it's scary. So what does it tell you about the mentality of most people? You don't have to know how to make it. If you truly love cinema. With all your heart and with enough passion, you can't help but make it good movie. I always feel like I could do anything. That's the main thing people have controlled by. Thoughts, their perception of themselves. They're slow down by their perception of themselves. If you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything. I always thought I could do everything. You got nervous that somebody else was right. It was talking to you. Who made it a position of power like their opinion somehow was right or better than you. You can never stop the thing like, you know, it's just different. You just think differently like doing that's okay, but I'm not wrong. You can get filled with such fear and it's really easy to get to just get your heart broke and sort of beat me. Make sure what you do is the product of your own conclusion. Just don't give a fuck. That's kind of the best thing to do.
