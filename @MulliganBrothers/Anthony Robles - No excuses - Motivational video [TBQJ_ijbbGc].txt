Every soul who comes to earth with the leg or two of her, must wrestle his opponents knowing. It's not what it is. It's what can be that measures work. Make it hard, just make it possible. And through pain, I'm not complaining. My spirit is unconquered. Fearless I will face each foe, for I know I am capable. I don't care what's probable. Through blood, sweat, and tears, I am unstoppable. When I was born, my birth daddy immediately failed. I was born a fun leg and my mom could have walked away, just giving me up for adoption. But she didn't. She taught me to never let what I can do, interfere with what I can do. She didn't protect me from pain and fun, because she knew what would make me stronger. We all wrestle with their own challenges. We all wrestle with their own obstacles. There's always something waiting around the corner that's going to challenge us. But what I like to say is that you can't let the challenge become an excuse. You can't let the challenge pull you down and continue to the math. You have to fight through it and figure out a way to get it done and become unstoppable. You can win my mom got sick at the beginning of my sophomore in college and my step dad walked out on the family. We lost our home and I wanted to quit wrestling to get a job to help pay the bills. My mom refused to let any of us give up. And here I am today National Champion.
