I'm not done by any stretch in the imagination. My handle is a lot of the champion. I will not shy away from it. I will not make excuses to it. I lost in there. It was errors. But errors can be fixed if you face your head on and fixed them. That's it. I will celebrate this like like you should celebrate all adversity because it makes you It makes you grow and it makes you stronger. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. This is something that will make me stronger. We can eat a run from adversity or we can face adversity head on and conquer it. That's what I planted here. I will face it. I will take it on the chin. And I will carry on. I learned. I truly believe we are all equal as human beings. If we are obsessed with something and we truly pursue our passion. Everything we have, regardless of anything else. If you are obsessed, we'll cut, put in the time you will succeed. And that is philosophy that I carry my coaches carry and this is hard work. This is an obsession. Nothing can be hard work. I took a chance. It didn't pay off. I'll be back. I will. I will be where I want to be. I'm 100% confident that I will make it to the top. I have the skills. I have the dedication. It will happen. I'll let you know when it happens. I'm an open company for it. And without a doubt, you will see me on the UFC and the near future. Without a doubt. When the history books are in, I show up. If we are obsessed with something and we truly pursue our passion. With everything we have, regardless of anything else. If you are obsessed, book hard, put in the time. You will succeed. And that is philosophy that I carry. My coach is carry and this is hard work. This is an obsession. Nothing can be hard work.
