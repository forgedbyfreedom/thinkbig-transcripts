What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the universe? The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on earth, the atoms that make up the human body are traceable to the crucible that cooked, right elements into heavy elements in their core, under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars, the high mass ones among them, went unstable in their later years. They collapsed and then exploded, scattering, they're enriched guts across the galaxy. Guests made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas clouds that condense collapse form the next generation of solar systems, stars with orbiting planets and those planets now have the ingredients for life itself. Don't have a less somebody tell you, you can't do so. So that when I look up at the microscope and I know that yes we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in place. When I reflect on that fact, I look up. I think that's a great idea. I've got a dream, a lot of the tech. Many people feel small because they're small and the universe is big, but I feel big. Because my atoms come from those stars. There's a level of connectivity. That's really what you want in life. You want to feel connected. You want to feel relevant. You want to feel like you're a participant. You're going on with activities and events. That's precisely what we are just by being alone. I love living. I think that's infectious. There's something that you can't see. You want to take a leap of faith. What we're becoming all that. Feel the wind, we're glad.
