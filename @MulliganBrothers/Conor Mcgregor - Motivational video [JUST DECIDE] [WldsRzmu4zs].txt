Being realistic is the most commonly travel road to mediocrity. Why would you be realistic? I'm an open coming footer and without a doubt you will see me on the UFC in the near future, without a doubt. What's the point of being realistic? Something that truly exists in all of us. It's very simple. This is what I believe and I'm willing to die for it. Every hero you guys had was called an idiot, crazy, a loser. You must break society status quo. It's a choice. You just decide what is going to be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do it. Just decide. I will be where I want to be. I'm 100% confident that I will make it to the top. I have the skills, I have the dedication. It will happen when I let you know when it happens. The first step before anybody else in the world believes it is you have to believe it. Never say never. Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion. Passing, passing is free. Nobody can charge you for passing. Nobody can tell you what passion looks like. Because that's all about you. Effort, effort is isolate. The reason why effort is isolated, because nobody can dictate. Effort is 100% in the mind. No coach, no play up, nobody else can make you want to the wall. Nobody else can make you finish the tap. Nobody else can do it. If only you're finally figured out how to win real battles, it's kind of the fundamentals. That's what wins championships. That's what wins battles. Because you don't know what time feels like. Make a choice. You just decide what is going to be, who you're going to be, how you're going to do it. Let's decide. And then from that point, the universe is going to get out your way.
