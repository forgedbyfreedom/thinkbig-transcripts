There was a day that I became wealthy. I'll tell you a day I know that day I was rich. I was broke. I was pissed. I was angry everybody else but who myself? I had a friend that I loaned money to when I had girl enough and I knew we needed it. I gave him $1200 and I'm here not able to eat. I'm down to like $25-2600 and I'm saying to him, call him and he's not returning to my call and I just need some money. He's ignoring me. I didn't ignore him and I'm pissed. I'm frustrated. In this of all this, I'm also pragmatic. I got 25 and changed called $2600. What the hell am I going to do? I don't have any plans for economics. I got over at that's crazy. I'm living with a little tiny apartment from the square feet in this California. I should have been freaking out. How the fuck am I going to eat? But I didn't. I feel like something inside of me has finally got past scarcity. The finally realized there's something inside of us more than our limits. Especially when it's been called money that I had let terrorize me. I got home and the mailman came that day and I had no idea I was going to have my next meal. And that's what it comes. And it's from the guy I loaned the money to. And written notes saying, I've been avoiding you. It's wrong. I'm so sorry. You were there when I needed you. Here's what I owe you, plus a little bit more. And the 1200 was there. That's another 100 for the time that I had to take care of. And I cried. And then I decided, what does this mean? I thought this means that whenever you give, it's always going to come back so you don't have to ever think about that again. Just give. I don't know if that's coincidence. But I decided to believe that day was a blessing when I became rich. And I can tell you honestly, I've had tough days in my life economically, emotionally like all of us. But I've never gone back to that. It's scarcity I never will. The secret to living is giving. Do it when you don't have it. And I promise you, scarcity will lead your life.
