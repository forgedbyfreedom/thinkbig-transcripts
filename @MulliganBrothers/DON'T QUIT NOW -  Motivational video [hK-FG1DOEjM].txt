Now we have to start all over. You almost feel like an outsider. The coaches are sympathetic, but they still have to coach, and you're not there. It's a dark place. Probably the darkest it's ever been. You're saddened down and out. And you ask yourself why did this have to happen. It's in the moment that you find out who you really are and what you really are. Most of us go to life without breaks on. Holding back, not giving all that we have, not sharing all of ourselves. Most of us go to our graves, still holding all. Rather than releasing it, because of past experiences, past defeats, past pain. We look back where we didn't work out this. It probably won't work out now. It denied we were exposed for what we all right now. It means that what I did didn't work tonight. And I got the subway what I do from who I am. I feel like we all have two battles. Two enemies going on. One with the man across the river. The second is with the man inside of you. I think once you control the one inside of you, you want to cross from your really doesn't matter. I think that's what we're all trying to do. You aren't handed anything. You earn everything every single day, over and over again. You have to prove it. Get down. You've been using off the ground, just your hands and feet. There you go. A little bit left. I'm going to get that. You're going to get that for you. Yeah. Keep coming. There you go.
