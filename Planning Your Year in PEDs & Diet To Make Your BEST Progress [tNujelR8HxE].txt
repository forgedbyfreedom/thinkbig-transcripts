And this is something that I've shut to a lot of people with that used to be called hard gainers that needed all this food And it's like you didn't need all this food. It's just that you wasn't digesting half of it And your body was just inflamed and you were super insulin resistant because you just rushed your weight gain That's all it is So your body essentially should be responsive and then allergy like to get for all this is like when you sell a count fire Right if you keep throwing small little logs on that fire the fire keeps getting bigger Yeah, if you was to sell a fire and feel just the one big fucking love in the fire and guess what happens? Just get a smother it out just a small bit out What's up guys? Welcome back to Think Big Body Building Media I'm Scott McNaly and of course we are back again with your favorite drummer Could but challenge. Yeah, what's going on man? Back welcome back I can promise that I will most likely not be able to hold myself back from tapping the table I've even had a comment about you tapping the table. I apologize in advance Yes, that's just the you might not happen. I know I never know you have to watch that episode of find out I tell you your passionate you know you get into it. You can't help it I know we had a bunch of list of questions. We'll see if we get to those and you guys are always welcome to comment with questions And hey, we appreciate all the feedback. We got so much feedback on that last episode Cuba it was really cool. We connected to a lot of people We did get a few questions off the back of that plus comments questions all that stuff helps to boost us up Your likes are huge so if you'd like this show Please hit the like button and if you're new here We'd love to have you long for everything We did we got several podcast each week and by the way in the description I take Cuba too because you're doing a bunch of awesome stuff on your channel man all the time So I got to give you a huge shout-out on everything you're doing super inspirational quick clips long videos You got it all over there, man Appreciate it. I'm not yeah, I can't put the like it so it's going so what's up today? I got this note from you It was basically you know talking on what's up and you would said basically like planning your year out how to make Your long progress and and basically have it forming a bodybuilding and setting up a timeline Yeah, do you ever find that you can't struggle with having a sense of direction I'll never judge it times where people send a few lost what a building oh Yeah, so yeah, especially after a show if they're 16 weeks out man they've got it figured out but outside of that The biggest reason why I Trulubilly people feel lost is the news that sense of direction So if you do not have a well prepared or a well-planned timeline for your competitive season and your year You will feel lost because you have no sense of direction you have no kill clear goals So essentially What keeps most people deliver? It's having that gold right for good right? Yeah, when you are 16 weeks out you will always work harder When you are six weeks out you will always work harder Now think about this right you can break down your year into blocks and weeks where you almost periodize your entire year into phases That you have pre-planned and now this doesn't necessarily mean that you will stick to these phases exactly But it's much easier to actually follow our plan and be motivated and driven if you have a road Map and a clear sense of direction because when you have a clear sense of direction road map that is working towards a certain goal That might be 20, 30, 40 weeks away It's much easier to stay consistent and driven It's too of that goal if you just say to yourself Right, I'm going to compete for weeks. Yes, well if you don't know what you are going to do in that time frame You are going to get lost in the process because you don't know what sense of direction to take I'm supposed to be gaining all that time do I need to pull back? Do I need to do a hell of a is what do I need to do now to get the most out of the So where will we start Scott? I think first would be an athlete's assessment with Assessing what the athletes needs are for the time from the headset So let's use Scott an example right Scott come in an example on up. Yeah, I'd be happy to man Yeah, ready to go all right. Let's do it Right, so what we can do is Essentially say right Scott is going to be competing in Shall we say 8 pull 20 26 Sounds good so that gives us that gives us a little less than a year than right about Jesus a 40 or 40 more weeks exactly yeah So that is a long that us Time isn't it you do a lot with that or you could do a lot of nothing with that until 16 weeks out To a lot of nothing with absolutely so The first thing we need to do set that goal there, right and then while I do it there's reverse engineer Exactly what we are going to do in terms of the process to take you there Yeah, so if we are aiming to have you ready for 19 for April 2026 Roughly knowing your background. Let's give you an example that I'm going to work in with you for next 40 more Right, yeah, that will give me an idea of how long you will need to get your shape for ideally I'm going to give you 20 weeks to get in shape because I know that you can get in shape pretty easily right Pretty pretty really Absolutely yeah, pretty pretty easily but the goal is to make sure that will bring you big We give you enough time to be able to manage fatigue. We can be enough time to be able to then peak and ideally What my goal is for you is to make sure you are ready up two weeks out Okay, is that fair enough? Yeah, absolutely I feel I'll spare it off right so essentially what we do is this I would set the goal of Having you ready for 2019 for April then I would get the timeline up and what I would do is then reverse engineer the prep from that timeline date So 20 prep reversing that back and what I actually do and I don't you probably don't use it What you might do at my point sure or I actually have timeline set on my Google sheets Okay, and that is a timeline that I do set that Give you Basically four time frames with the goals and a breakdown of it so clients can actually see that clearly and they could go into any time and and view it And that way They can actually see exactly what they are working towards and what essentially needs to happen Within the process yeah So that's something that I like to definitely work with on half set And look the time as that sets are often to change or so essentially if my 40 weeks last for you Scott 20 week prep that leaves now 21 weeks of progress right? Yep Let's say we have just completely an eight week diaphase So you are leaning off now to have a runaway for a 16 is a growing Right, which would be a great place to be at right as you're trying to gain more muscle you know into the show Yeah, so right now we've got 16 weeks to go yeah, so breaking this down 16 to grow in followed by a six week prep phase That's 22 weeks already into a 19 week prep 19 to 20 weeks That's your timeline set Now When you have that timeline set you can then set different goals and structures in that 16 week push-up So in that 16 week push-up let's say Scott we need to gain 20 pounds of tissue If we gain more than 20 pounds you are going to be sloppy and that will then pause at a less than optimal show say optimal right a lot of people like optimal these days Yeah, and then we can say in our language If you gain more than 20 pounds Scott you're going to be too fat to getting shape and great in a condition that we actually need right Yeah, goal is to have your blutes peeled inside out and I mean all the weight into your also right and to do that To do that you want hard blinks you want peeled lose guess well you can have to start pretty lean You're not gonna be able to stop fat yeah, that's a fact So essentially We are going to set framework for that 16 week push-up And we are going to give you a goal for the rate of gain that we want to achieve over the 16 weeks Yeah, so I've agreed We've got 20 week try Sorry, we've got 20 pounds divided by 16 weeks that gives us 1.25 1.25 1 pound And 2.5 per week on average right right What are we going to do now Scott to achieve that rate of gain? We're going to get on three grams of sauce first of all and Listen that is that is where the next conversation happens is How much drugs do we need for you to come up 20 pounds over these 60 weeks? Yeah, roughly Without gassing the death or way in in your risk to the world ratio Yeah and keeping in mind like you said too We're right at the back end of a prep by the time we finish this, you know Absolutely, so we'll all have six weeks of health days before So essentially what I'd like to do is this I'm going to use the six week window to escalate the drugs to be pink those stuff We're going to use them in half the 10 weeks Okay, so let's give you number for you Scott and other you like testing the cube right We are going to start with 500 tests. I'll give you a cuter to gain with I'll take it then and then I'm going to go right We'll run that for first few weeks two weeks two weeks two little sponsors like that guess well And extra hundred test extra really cute will not for a couple more weeks And then we'll titrate up on the fix six weeks period or two let's give you a cap Your peak del synch of 1000 and 500 milligrams per week. Okay interesting Then we will hold that for ten weeks Assess the blood work at the end of the push-up and then the blood recovery assessment will then you as a guideline of what we need to do for the health phase and pre-preface To then get you ready for the contest season I think that's great. I do have a question for you that why use the six weeks at the beginning to Titrate the doses up Versus just starting with peak doses Do things Initially initially when you are lean and I think when you are drug start to come up You simply don't need as much to see a good response. Yeah, so it's like me saying Right, which transition to a push-up phase now now Scott right from a deficit Why are we only adding 500 calories instead of adding 1000 calories? Yeah, yeah because you don't need it It's exactly the same thing you don't need it you do I do when you do need it It's interesting you say this Cuba because you know years ago Well years ago we used to front load everything and I think a lot of that had to do with Cycles were a very short period of time and we all came off did PCT and recovered So we had to be in and out in eight to ten weeks I think that was a big reason for the front loading But after that my thought had always been Let's get up to those peak doses as some especially with long-esters because they're gonna take a long time to build anyway That said I'm starting to see I'm more in alignment with what you are saying now Where I might start a guy out with say the heat we're gonna do 600 tests 600 EQ We might start with three and three and get what we can out of that for a while because he's not gonna have to worry about coming off to recover We could extend the life of that cycle and continue getting more maybe six eight weeks and that's the reason I asked you because I thought you might have been along that same My frame, but we don't really talk about that a lot on the channel so I like to you brought that up Why I personally did and yeah, I have found where personal experience for myself and clients Especially some of the clients that I have worked recently a few pros that used to have the approach of right my coach said This is a cycle and that's what we were on for 20 weeks. Yep, and it was it was actually going from like 400 make up to two and a half grams Shray away yeah, and it's like what they would know it is Progress is excellent for the first 10 weeks. Yeah, and then after 10 week window Because they also rush the food up and they're selling flamed They're not just inflamed from the drugs, but they're also inflamed from way too much food way too quickly getting body fat too high too quickly And they guess what after 10 week window nothing happens the body is just unresponsive and then what do you do then? Do you add more food? Jai more drugs? Well, what is that left to odd you've used all of the tools up already? You painted yourself in a corner at that point And you're putting body fat on at a rapid rate if you were right food up about the gate now I'm with you 100% I mean I've always done that with contest preps, but it's only been in the last two About three years so I started looking at that in off-season as well information Jai starts her and this is all Basically coming back real from the experience that I've had With experience of different cycles and doing different methods, right? And I've done it every single way possible now both myself and clients So you get to see a pattern right with yeah, what is the most? What things what what can I do Scott right? To get the absolute most progress And for me that is a patient escalation in drugs Working up to our peak doses over six days week window maybe yeah, and then holding up peak dose for another 10 to 12, 30, 40 weeks based of how I feel in a good work I guess what's got if I went to my peak dose of straight away that cycle probably would have been cut short by eight nine weeks yeah, yeah now knowing what we know about muscle growth and how slowly actually happens You cannot force muscle growth It's a slow process. It's a process of adaptation. It takes time. It takes consistency and it takes a slow steady surplus with enough gear to see progression You cannot force muscle on with food or steroids you try and force muscle on of steroids you're just getting flamed You try and force muscle on with food you just get fat It's a strategy that you have to take where you layer one over the other over time And then guess what is the most important thing then that fuels fuels the muscle growth when you get your nutrition gear on point What's that the training of course so in that 16 week windows go we would be working on setting Training performance goals training performance parameters across your main lifts I want to see your lifts progressing if you're a little not progressing Whatever you decide or you execution whatever you phone clips would have you you're recovery Wherever you evolve you were made to the lower the volume down when made to change the training split Made to change the frequency you would have you the set of constantly to make sure the needle is moving up Your body weight has to be coming up consistently you have to be getting Progressive the stronger in the gym even moving more load or overall doing a degree of more stimulus achieved in various different ways It has to happen Scott if none of these things are moving forward you are not adding muscle tissue So therefore Utilizing a timeline like this not only gives you a good guideline for your actual gear for your planning and preparation But it gives you a good guideline of what you need to do for a performance standpoint So if I knew you only had 16 weeks right to get there what I would pull the work in is I would post split that into three different training blocks Right I would have Probably five weeks of going all out Three days rest and repeat that three times that would take us up to 16 weeks And the way I would periodize is yes we implement rest as of when we need it But essentially Scott if you work hard enough train hard enough life sometimes gets in the way You will need to allocate some of these extra rest days in now and then when they are need this sure so Essentially I do like to have that as a precaution Imagine for most people that wanted this and train actually train hard enough. It's needed Now If I was to create that guideline for you and if I was to Put that into practice when you're checking in with me you're looking at your timeline You're seeing the weeks go by everything or week and then guess what it's only getting closer and close to me that that showday is Luminant room it so 458 period will literally go like this because you set all these Slow term goals, but also short term goals that your constantly working towards Constantly reviewing in constantly excessive and I think that's a huge one Just to make sure that not only you stay motivated but you stay driven and more importantly The the many thing that most people struggle with is accountability I think most people struggle with having that accountability in place and I think that's a huge one I think that really is a huge one now Scott is anywhere can I can share my screen Yeah, there actually is if you look down at the bottom where you can hit leave conversation and all that There's a button that says share I've hidden some of the some of the juicy stuff for myself All right because that's that's not for everyone to see Anyway, I'd like to show you my timeline All right, and I'll let's show some my notes for my entire offseason how I break things down for myself And how I break things down for clients so hope for that gives you an idea You can see everything clearly, you know, yeah, oh yeah 24 June 2024 that was my recovery phase maintenance Recovery phase is simply post shell phase I only did four weeks Scott because my blood work actually improved in prep and I didn't gas myself to death Which then I didn't really need that long to recover and get everything back improving okay, I finished up two thirty And I started my push up at two thirty eights I 240 so I only gained ten pounds in that recovery phase Which was just enough to regain some body fat and then have me feeling good now Look at the rate of gain now and look at the changes when you're trisha Can you see now the rate of gain isn't exactly a pound in a half per week Some weeks it's less some weeks it's more some week it's holding and some weeks it's coming down because Some of the body weight increases will be down to fluctuations in water from additions of compounds and again escalations of certain compounds that may actually have an impact on Underwaterway itself, but when you look at the body weight average and when you look at the push-up itself Which lasted and again Super patient right look at a time from here we started up 240 under push-up and it's pretty much 30 weeks in 32 week push-up done start that 240 finish it like to wait You go back after your d-loads, too don't you yeah, yeah a little bit a little bit a little bit so Every time I do load again big big shift up and as you can see that that's with no changing nutrition like that was the last change in nutrition here and it helped Okay, so In terms of changes from nutrition as you can see the hasn't really been that many changes. It's been nice and steady And I actually like to take smaller increases as of when they are needed and generally It's 250 calories at a time or even 200 calories at a time just to get me moving forward so as you can see The surplus that is required To gain muscle tissue is not very big Yeah So when you're taking consideration of what you actually need to influence muscle growth It's always always a small consistent surplus all the time It's not a case of just throwing a ton of calories in and expecting a huge return now Recovery phase completed That was like a bit of a bit of a bridge pulse push it face Where I enter kind of hold away and dropped a lot of it away as you normally wish and did some stem cells in Columbia at that time as well So my body was super fresh and then as you can see calories just means now it's got right And this is where we are right now a 30th of a June prep So check this out one calorie adjustment to kick start the prep Second calorie adjustment to get things moving Not much for third calorie adjustment Third calorie adjustment now And that has been in place since 20 at some pretty much end of April Yeah, I haven't made a haven't made a few changes since and the body weight is still coming down and I'm still getting later Love it man This is the merit and this is the benefit of not only a well timed timeline But also a well executed timeline where you are not getting too fat you are eating to your needs And you are doing only what's enough to get the rat response Yeah, yeah, I love it In the child you're if you're increasing 250 calories it is a 250 260 pound body builder that may be even less for a guy who's you know I like heavyweight guy who's gonna be 190 on stage it might be 32 grams of carbs, you know 40 comes a call start should get you move it if you're a smaller guy 34 grams of carbs that's all you need each and the huge point there is Scott is I Made small changes and I saw an immediate response of the back of those changes If you are making changes in enough season guys and girls and Your body is not responding It might be numerous things it's either you are not accurate when you're food You are either over eating or under eating or having way too much uncontrolled off-dland meals Where that's shoes and your body weight consists of every week so your actual surplus is much higher than you think it is Yeah, but also If you're interested in the ability shot because you're going too much right too quickly you are overgashing yourself and you are a little bit too stressed your body just won't respond So sometimes you need to re-eraluate yourself if you need And this is something that I've I've shocked a lot of people with that used to be called hard gainers that needed all this food and it's like You didn't need all this food it's just that you wasn't that adjusting half of it and your body was just inflamed and you were super Insolent resistant because you just rushed your weight gain that's all it is So your body essentially should be responsive and then allergy like to get for all this is like When you sell per campfire right if you keep throwing small little logs on that fire the fire keeps getting bigger Yeah, if you was to sell per fire and for all just the one big fucking love in the fire and guess what happens? Just get a smothery out just a little bit out the same principle applies with both Your contest preparation and your offseason I cannot stress the importance of having the self control To only do what's required when you are trying to gain muscle There will come a time where you need more volume the will come a time we need more drugs There will come a time we need more food. Well guess what's got you don't need to do it all at once It needs to be happened at the right time guess what Your progress thought you might need a bit of a call is now But if you had made that change before you actually need it you are using your tools at prematurely the same thing applies When you are in contest prep Yes, you could be doing more Yes, you could be eating less Is it required at this moment time for you to keep progressive? No, yeah, it isn't yeah, that's a great that's the the big thing and I know that people get excited I think you figured that out after you've been in it for a while with the prep side of things You know you can't start with two hours of cardio and no carbs because where you're going to go from there you painted yourself in a corner Mate I'm gonna use myself as a example here not not to not to kind of like beat too fucking Oring but I haven't made a food change in like what 10 weeks now Scott yeah, I love that now I promise you It requires a lot of self control for me to not just be like fuck this I am not hungry. I don't feel like I'm on prep Yeah, now in weeks out I should be feeling like I'm on prep but like well why do I need to do that now when I'm clearly getting gifted progress? Yeah, I am I may as well just keep riding the wave of progression and guess what? It will come a time where I'm going to feel a pitch But now is not the time now is the time to just Keep focusing the process stay calm don't make any rush of decisions And the biggest mistake as he people make is they want to have novelty Yeah people struggle to just stay patient and struggle to just focus on the process and they almost require that change when Essentially sometimes the best thing can do is not change a thing and I mean listen It's not easy to keep checking in every week and be like well I don't need to make any changes. I'm getting leaner Food stays the same step say the same drugs stay the same we don't need to be doing anything else Stay on the course that is it. You don't need more you don't need less That's all you have to do and sometimes I mean it's the hardest thing to do ever Or I promise you I if you can harness that and if you can harness that self control It's simply going to be the most valuable thing that you can ever ever do it really will be So you know too kuba that also goes for the coaches you know because I feel like there is a pressure as a coach Some things to when I feel like you need to do something different you need to do and I'll catch myself I'm like sometimes if I don't have the check the check-ins I take the longest with are Sometimes the check-ins where there's nothing to change because if there's nothing to change I'm asking myself well what am I is there anything I'm missing here maybe I should dig a little bit deeper and I find myself spending more time Whereas if I see the change instantly I'm like oh, let's do this go But it's those changes what those check-ins where you don't need changes that they can hang you up It can it can be I think a trap to make yourself feel self important to be like oh, let's do this Let's change this you know no Versus seven weeks eight weeks on the same diet and you know Sometimes they have to have the confidence to say like in an explain Sometimes you have to show the pictures even and say this is what you look like before This is what you look like now this is why we're not changing anything You know because there is a pressure I think from the athlete to make the coach want to do things and then there's a pressure from the coach to to feel self important Absolutely and and you know what this is where some I think sometimes You've got to remind yourself that People are paying you To get them the most pro-resppossible people Not paying you to entertain them in a fashion yeah and people are not paying you to be a cheerleader People are paying you to bring the best out of them Sometimes I think when you explain it in such fashion to clients I think then they're appreciated But that is all for timelines. I'm not gonna keep repeating that and be the old drug I think it's time to move on to next topic before people that start to Start to gouges as out of it like right guys. Let's go move on right The one thing that I want to touch on is it is just a little bit on on the habit creation right because a lot of people are I mean glp1 dry it's right the use of glp1s now is it's crazy ever's using yeah Now one thing that I want them dig into and mention is this You tell us in a glp1 is not going to make hope for your lack of discipline If you are already that the person that gives in at any moment a glp1 is not going to change your Shit or habits around nutrition around your lifestyle Before you consider taking any glp1s Please please work on dialing in Your habits Controlling your eating and making sure that you are not taking a glp1 just to Set aside some of the mistakes that you are making would be data process Because I think some I think a lot of people are using them for that purpose and look I'll be the first one say it when it comes to different processes and when it comes to Everything body of the coaching I am a she-lo-oper-minded. I am not against the use of glp1s In most cases in some cases I do think they can't have the place will I need to use it? No will 95% 99% of my client see to use it No Will I use it was some clients that I know will benefit from it? Yes These clients going to benefit from it as a crutch no Right where it's applicable is Guys and girls that naturally have a much higher appetite the guys and girls that are not Vinging the guys and girls that are not having adherence issues It's simply the guys and girls that I know are suffering suffering So much more than others the guys and girls that have to dig so much deeper to get the fat loss that's required The guys and girls that simply cannot sleep all night because they are staying up with hunger all night But guess what they are still not picking up them fucking cookies and eating Yeah, so I heard you guys Any drug that is out there now you can use it. Yes I need drugs out there now can't be beneficial Well, it's only beneficial if you are using it It's a compliment The work you are already putting in yeah Yeah, I can't argue with that man. I think there are additional benefits to the newer ones I think that with some agglutide the main thing we're seeing is just that blunting of the appetite When we get into a trisappetite and then even better with reticutide There are additional health benefits that will improve fat loss that will with the Improved energy levels with the glucogon release so I do think there's the stuff to that But I am still I'm with you a hundred percent because if you are using that It's the only thing that's holding you together, you know You're never gonna be able to Successfully do what you want to do if you're relying on it no question I will say this though, too. I do think that if you were somebody who say had an issue right If you you could use it as a crutch in a larger program I'm gonna be honest man there's some people that I tell like you really need like to go to a counselor You know that like you need a counselor to to work on your relationship both food You know and in that case maybe there's something that could work in there, you know, but on its own just as a bandaid Yeah, I'm with you a hundred percent man Listen I agree a hundred percent. I mean look these things are a great for a reason right but at the same time I do think that It's The only thing I fear People just using it as just like a scapegoat right it's like oh I'm hungry I can't control myself So I'm just going to use that to completely negate the home though. It's like Well, why do you do this in first place like the the beauty? I feel like the beauty of bodybuilding Is in the part where it's fucking hard not everyone can do it Yeah, that is why that is why I love it so much it's like I Think to myself like I'm not going to be ever the best bodybuilder right on stage But I pride myself in being like one of the best bodybuilders off stage because I know I can do what 99 percent of people are not capable of doing and like I get kick off that I feel like that's the beauty of bodybuilding and that's why I fell in love with bodybuilding because it is so hard and it keeps your Our soul much and I feel like The satisfaction that you get from bodybuilding also comes from that hurt and that pain The self-channel action in you know, I think you have the challenge and then she happens that it brings and then overcoming that challenge That's the beauty of it man. So guys don't take away that beauty because I promise you That is what will make you feel good and that is what gives you the success Yeah, now What what have you found in terms of just common practice with the GLPs and what would you tell the listeners to do more so look out for when it comes to Well, of course the implementation of GLPs and considerations around the GLPs as well And would you ever speak to a client before actually implementing your GLPs and maybe have the conversation with them that look? Yes, we can implement it but This is what I would like to point of practice before you consider GLP and then we can have so what need to And then write to use the GLPs that makes sense Yeah, that that that that someone someone someone almost is like earned the right to use the GLP or Would it not work well of yourself because for me I have made it very clear to clients is like Nothing's ever off the table. I am a very open minded coach. I am always happy to listen But you need to earn the right for the GLPs come into play Yeah, yeah, I'll say this so I I One thing to keep in mind is that if somebody is using it for a crutch I've found myself experimenting with bread a true tide it's much more difficult to load on breada Is it it's harder eat a lot of food? I even when I've done Like a chill on Fridays I can't get the same volume of food in and what we're finding is Getting off of it a couple weeks out in Andrew and I and skip have talked about that on blood sweat and gear Discontinuing a couple weeks out is going to be important to be able to get a full load in a lot of cases and when that happens that hunger is all gonna come back and if you can't deal with that You're gonna mess things up because if you have a cheap meal that you weren't supposed to it 12 weeks out That's one thing but if you go hard need to large pizzas at you know two weeks out you you might affect your final look So definitely need a handle on it. I'd say everybody I'm working with that uses it just about everybody Is either in a position where they've died it with me before and then we it we never used semis But now that right as out we've said okay, well, let's try a micro dose and that's another aspect too. I think that the devil's in the dose so Right a true tide between you know it's being tested between 4 8 and 12 milligrams so if we start at say a micro dose of 500 micro grams twice a week We're still way under we may work up to like two milligrams to get some additional benefit from it But we're not like you know just crashing the appetite out you know we're seeing if we can And then other cases might be somebody who already has blood sugar issues, you know I think that you can It is kind of a cheat code for Restoring insulin sensitivity for somebody if it does have issues a guy. I'm setting up a diet on right now He I As we're talking I find out he has a really hard time getting in shape and I'm looking at his blood sugar fasted blood sugar numbers and they're Higher than they should be although they're not out of range and so always Jesus I come in together You don't see yeah, I don't I don't think he had it on his labs. We're gonna look at that though And we're gonna do some more testing but so and then as I'm digging further I ask him I was like so do you have any family history of diabetes and it turns out he says yeah A lot of my family's diabetic including my mom so I'm already thinking to myself like this is a guy who's gonna need some glucose disposal He might be a good candidate so it's an individual Individual situation, you know now We ran in back to timelines in that recording phase now six week later before the show the real face That is a time where I and again that's something from you as well that you mentioned to me When drugs come down that would be an ideal time to potentially trial something like RETA and S of you To improve your insulin sensitivity when you are going for that period of time where Anna Bollocks are coming down off the back of a longer off season 100 percent I can probably understand running some SLU and RETA together in that time frame would set someone up perfectly for a prep Because one thing that I always know is and you'll notice that yourself When you take clients run off season and let's say someone's and that's gonna be just me pulling numbers out of the house Yeah, that's gonna be someone finishing on two grams of gear right two grams total finishing the cycle and the finished eating some for like five thousand cows per day Yeah They will probably feel like they have an appetite at that point Yeah, this after first week on lower antibiotics I Nine times out of ten the feedback that I get from them after about ten days they like a Homery broke before I'm your meal and stronger sometimes too. You notice that and stronger the homeless high That would be a perfect time for a little bit of RETA And SLU to see if you can actually prime the body ready for fat loss Improved insulin sensitivity Increase of these molecules and improve mice and concentrate to a degree yeah, yeah, I think that would be great I want to something I want to something that yeah, I think you really can fast-trick it I've seen people Bring their fasted insulin levels down dramatically, you know over the course of four weeks So I mean I I really do think you could do something with that especially now with RETA and even Tris appetite versus Some of the good I think some of Glutite is really reserved for just appetite control and I've seen it as far as Combination of the both using say a Small dose of semia for the appetite control along with a dose of RETA, you know Another micro dose of RETA combining the one in the three Because you don't get as much appetite control from RETA on its own it's it's it's I'd say minimal now the other thing though You said are what are the things I'd consider you decide effects number one being Digestion are you able to still push the food through your system skip said, you know and he's an aging bodybuilder as we get older We get more distension and he was like I'm noticing I get more I'm noticing I get more distension than I used to Says it's not more Sure I'm looking back on my last prep and some days of eating and you said a struggle to load Two days out two days out Loading 8,283 calories 200 four six-year-old protein 1600 one thousand six-year-old and 74 and I'm the carbs six to seven fat and guess what tell these what I still wasn't full by the day yeah So I could put it I could have ease like more with that distension, you know if you if you're dealing with that and in constipation It's all about really trained to jack up everything you can with digestion digestive enzymes possibly HCL batin and magnesium It was a Yeah, yeah, yeah, I use this product that has both of those in it Super enzymes it's a it's a low dose of batin along with enzymes and pepsin and then It's magnesium citrate to if needed, you know She must put digestive pharma pro from Trambojia per year actually has full digestive enzymes panel and Betaine HCL as well. It's it's actually it's actually real really good Scott like what's the code on that? Who about that you know the troll make you know the 10 all right? I like that shirt You know what you know what it's legit. I'm gonna have to send you on the try. It's I'd love to try it It's actually it's actually it's actually it's saying how good it is When it comes to digestion How do you know that? That's a good one because I said question of someone asking me if they should be taken digestive enzymes if the digestion is completely fine And I'm not sure we ought to take his on it, but We are not designed to be digestive through a bunch of protein per day Right So with that in mind I think anyone that isn't using digestive enzymes I think they're stupid not to I mean if you're eating two meals a day, yeah, you probably don't need them. I guess yeah if you're eating four five six meals per day awkward of three and a half or thousand calories awkward of three and a hundred grams of protein per day Carbs and fats and tap your stomach and stomach acid is not actually designed to be eaten that much food so in my opinion You should more than like the be using some sort of digestive aid on a daily basis If you're food is high I think Prevention is bad in the cure, right? Yeah, hey how many times do you use a digestive enzyme a day and I ask because I find sometimes there are people that do get it. They're just just excuse me. I chest of enzyme And then they tell me oh, yeah, I take that and I said well, won't you take it? They say I take it with my multi in the morning So they take it one time in the first thing in the you know, they're not using it with food Yeah, I'll take it just before I eat How many times every every meal? Four four times per day, they're just events. I'm okay. So I take my GDAs with meal one two three Five I don't take them across work at meal and I don't take them in your five Then I take magnesium on me here's with everything on meal. Yep I take that's all of 14 of 1500 grams of elemental magnesium Which has a hefty dose, but guess what my sleep's incredible. I feel I feel amazing on it manages super high That just is amazing So I generally take digestive enzymes better meal and I take amigas with them. You'll and I do take magnesium with our meals without a single meal as well Okay, okay cool figured I just get that out there It's a good point actually. I think a lot of people a lot of people that can take your food It's like well, you actually supposed to take it with food all the fall food. Yeah Hey, do you want to knock through some listener questions real quick while uh small over here? Or did you have any people who are covered? I said mom, I think uh I think with with covered all the points that were had on the agenda for today All right because we did get a bunch of them from the last one and as I mentioned before you guys you're welcome to comment with blessings in and let us know What do you think about the program? You know what what would you like to hear us talk about next? Here is one of the questions. It says Cuba mentions in the podcast Ensuring that you get a sensitive E2 test Where is he getting this done in the UK? I have checked with Dave about a year or two ago and Eval isn't sensitive E2 It's just standard Yeah, you can get it. It's just custom of extra custom. I'm gonna take a lot time. Okay, okay So you can get it done. It's just it will just cost you a little bit more But look it's not an necessity but if you are taking tremble and or or decker It will show up in your estrogen in an a standard in a standard estrogen test So I see so many people panic thinking of God crazy higher strudin. It's like No, you haven't you're either taking MPP or you take a tremble and that's showing up with estrogen and In reality what happens then it's guys That's not having natural health and stuff and just oh yeah, really like close to estrogen like a Have no energy and flat but joints are so unlike well no one to make because the estrogen was already probably What's in so you've just completely crushed any bit of it you had Yeah Here is a good one and I'm curious to hear what you have to say about this in fact I think this could be a topic for a future podcast or like a complete topic for the whole show He says yeah, this is in reference to the last episode where we talked about Doing everything you can to maintain gains between cycle and Getting yourself into the best position you can be he said yeah, though it's okay If you've got a spare 800 quid or more to spend on drugs every month during a cost-eleving crisis But who the fuck actually has the money to compete in bodybuilding? What a dick What a dick sorry Scott, well that's like no, are you? I'm not sure you know what you know what that is a comment for someone extremely bitter like extremely bitter Guess what made people spend so much more on video games never mind Not too loading if you don't have an extra 800 pound of money to spend on your hobbies Guess what make you need to work fucking harder you need to get get second job Like what mate when when when I was 18 years old when I was 18 years old Because my more than dad had no money. I had to work three jobs to be able to sustain myself Yeah, and work towards my goals so genuine people come out with bullshit out that it's like Mate, I have seen people come from fucking nothing to have him In men's wealth. I saw my more in dad work for five pound an hour 12 13 hour shifts to get somewhere Guess what mate if you want something bad enough you'll make it happen. I want it to bodybuild I came for a poor background My more dad didn't have money to fund me. Guess what I had to do? I had to get another fucking job to fund myself How I'm a general all this life again, and I know it let's just go back to be sensible now Yeah Why does it have to do with a drugs like why can you not maintain your gains without a bowl load of drugs? Well, that's that's I'm maybe what he's getting it because the podcast we put out We're talking about these are the things you can these are the things you can do supplement wise and then we got into like the SLU growth and stuff like that So yeah, shall we? I should do an episode or what can do that's not drugs to sustain the gains I think even man not only that, but like how can we do bodybuilding on the cheap because at the end of the day All of us need to think about you know affordability, you know, it's like we don't None of us should be you know spending everything we have we have responsibilities we got family people out there have families and kids So they know they're doing what they can you know So I'm thinking maybe it we can take the negative comment and spin it into something that would be really helpful to people I didn't know that a budget yeah, I love it man. Let's freaking do that I love it I got it right here man, I fact I had a burden on my phone already Make what I'm making out Scott yeah, we'll do that bodybuilding a budget and you know what I How to I had to bodybuilding a budget and I will I can go into depth on how I bodybuild it for like 40 pound a week Yeah, yeah, I got laid off during my first prep Cuba I was making not a lot Put it this way too like even when I got the job working for the pop company man They they screwed us like I did not make good money until I started coaching You know I quit my world in photography and came home and took a job and just was like looking for direction But man I I remember I remember making I think it was like God, I'm gonna say $800 every two weeks No, and that's like including I had to pay rent I had a car to deal with you know I had to pay for gas and yeah, I mean there's a lot man $400 a week and that's like before taxes So like and then when I got laid off in my first prep I was pretty much doing that on my own man like I couldn't afford supplements, you know I had a very minimal gear My food was like oh and you know we can get into it. You know on that episode, but like I was shopping around It wasn't the same meat every time you know you had to use what you could find find the deals, right? Absolutely, but you could do it if you want to make it happen you can do it, right? You can definitely do it mate. You can definitely do it. I mean this and I did it And I can go into depth on I didn't you will Scott as well and I think people find a lot of value in it Just the only thing I'll practice this with is it's not gonna be the most enjoyable way to do things But it did the job. Yeah, yeah, okay. It did the job this one is kind of got a few points to it He says what's your pure brand of BCA? So my follow-up question that he didn't ask is Cuba do you use BCA is I Do not I just use yeah, I use or even that I use mps max which has kkc Hydrology which is a three digested It's a petal problem. You know you know what I is Yeah, it's it's probably the best quality Probably you can take him especially Around the workout window if you want something that I just super quick the only problem is it does come into higher price stack So if I was to have like a tier it would always be App to pro slash and ps max casino draw say yep, and then it would be EA's BCA's I wouldn't really use them scum not an I would you I've always said that you have EA or BCA is in your EA but your BCA is are gonna give you all the building blocks, you know That was John. Yeah, yeah Yeah, you want your essential amino is not not just the brand-changing I was because just doesn't really make sense to how the product but isn't really a complete When you can have something that is complete. So there's JP having EA I assume he does Yeah, he does yeah, yeah, it's got some it's got a few different versions as well as got EA with hydration as well Okay, so yeah, he's all this that's all true nutrition does to they have EA plus and then they have the raw Just EA powder which taste like garbage, but if you want to do it cheap, it's it's definitely a way to go when it's only like 25 bucks for a pound Like you're gonna be drinking shakes that tastes like crap, you know, but they're gonna Okay, got maybe a couple more here What do you recommend to help with water retention when pushing carbs already taking Tell me certain and hydro chlorothyside which helps stress. I know a guy Stop taking it with dioretics you're around or like can you tell your genetics to manage this is right first Right, that's just new right yeah if you need to take your ethics to manage your water attention You need to assess the various stack design you're taking too much drugs or you are simply too far You need to diet. It's not water. It's fat. It's coming to show both I can tell you now I can take up to a thousand million artists and 12 or 13 I use a growth and I will not hold much water Because I'm not fat the muscle Exactly, the more body fat you carry the water you will store If you are already taking time to start and I very much doubt you are taking crazy crazy cycles That are going to lead to you holding that much water so essentially my friend You need to diet before you put yourself in serious serious health risk taking that side just Year round dude Come on please stop that if you want please message me personally or message Scott direct And it can give you like further Guidelines to do so you do not you know record yourself please do Yeah, yeah, I do know a guy who I met him at the gym He was one of those people sometimes you see guys at the gym that just had the craziest body parts He had the biggest traps I'd ever seen in my life like average body builder in general But it is traps were enormous he wasn't he wasn't like Jimmy and I'm up or anything either But so we're talking and he says yeah, I usually do just you know the offseason like two Sustan on a week and then in the summer I like to run trend he's like and then all summer I use diuretic to help stay drier, you know and Like man you got it we got to change that and literally like within a month He goes to police academy Does the physical and his kidney numbers were off like way off? So we see a specialist and finds out he's on failure and has to go on dialysis And he had to do with running diuretics long term dehydrating himself, you know I needlessly All you could have done you could have just stayed Lena. That's it. Yeah, yeah All right one more here pro tip for cruising at 750 test It's a good question Do not cruise at 750 test that is not cruise my friend that is a cycle That is what I would put the start my cycle not cruise What is an average pro cruise look like it let's talk big guy Big guys right I would post a bit between 400 up to 600 milligrams ish Yeah, give a take on give a take on the milligrams I I have seen some guys cruising in 750 But I'm very rarely see it just being test however yeah, sorry I have seen more commonly guys do like 700 tests just as a cruise after a show or Personally I just want to go that high I go a little bit lower Yeah, and we're talking big guys right so we're talking we're talking guys that like compete and I like 240 250 260 yeah, so that guy is so that Most of us yeah, so the guys that I I can you know example like I've got a guy that that'll compete 260 stage I've got another one that will compete like 240 found on stage Yeah, he'll inside out So that means right Tonight so eight tonight you have season here and they generally cruise One of them cruises around 400 milligrams of one cruise and around 500 or 550 Yeah, and that is a I make sure a lot of it's a stash drone and a tiny bit of master Oh, pretty much yeah I wouldn't ever just I wouldn't recommend just cruising in 750 test because unless you are Post shell when you are extremely lean but if you are cruising after an off season push it plays and you body fat is somewhat higher then unfortunately The amount of normalization you have is just going to be very hard to control in 750 test or less you are a very low aroma tizer which fine you can do it But even then it's like the whole point of cruising is to bring that low down and to a degree give you body a bit of a break So essentially what I would prefer to do Scott personally is Probably the lower that's a stash drone a little bit make sure you take it daily if you like test just on test But maybe do 400 five-minute five hundred meters of test alone and instead just one quick you grow for the stage and that will give you the fullness and the recovery That is probably needed to sustain you All right, oh we did have a We have more growth hormone year round because we were talking about that last episode about using it to basically bridge between cycles Keep fullness keep strength, keep your your progress So what do you think about that? Do you meant is that something you would go up and down with or something you take breaks with? I don't take breaks will go from it. Yeah, I'll be honest. I don't I don't see the My growth hormone dose changes and I do Logric in cases Especially if growth hormone uses quite high Yeah, I personally do not see the need to come out of growth hormone. The only time people need to come off growth hormone really Is down to finances if someone is financially stable and they have high goals Why would you come off growth hormone when it's relatively relative to the scientific free? I mean the only times where you are putting yourself up more risk of growth hormone is if you are using very very high doses on a long period of time But essentially if you are using let's say for I use I mean It's relative to safe. I don't see the need to be coming off growth in my personal opinion I'm not sure what you're standing so I mean, but I personally prefer to leverage growth Over antibiotics because I just have seen much better results to it agree With much less detriment on a hot health lipid health. I'm just general health Even to health to be honest. So I could see I was not saying I could see all that I would say the only my only position would be to consider is What's your blood sugar doing? Some people I find are going to be more sensitive to that and and start running high blood sugar numbers Uncontrollably and then we have to manage that with insulin and then there's periods where it's like oh, we just don't want to have insulin in the plant You know see I don't really have issues with that anymore because I don't really lack people get to far out of shape Okay for a Florida tech. Have you problematic and if it is a problem and Mostly it's likely not growth hormone. It's just that they just need to diet and then okay for weeks in free for weeks in and It's all backing check so I would never if someone's already insulin is this thing I would never try to use insulin to try and combat resistance because then you are just making an Insolusive worse you're not fixing it because you're already too far gone You are at that point now where in services gone and you are trying to I and I personally don't actually like to use The faster blusher was adds much as a guideline for that because I have some guys that are always training high Test of load work and the HBC was is low HBC is low So that is a true gauge really for where you are with with the instance sensitivity because as someone is what factors that can actually influence your faster bluther Yeah, because I go but I don't really pay that much attention to it anymore I prefer to actually focus on the work but I still do use it Yeah, however My stance on on that in general is I wouldn't use insulin in that case. I would just Put someone out there Implement some cardio if they need it. You're someone's very sad and treat Probably even take a deal out at some times instance. This is kind of driven from just high inflammation and fatigue Yes, so I would follow review all these things possibly out further review the lifestyle and see what's driving it This is because nine times out of ten but I Have seen It's more so people think it's causation of correlation people think it's wrong for much rather than it or it's either the lifestyle They are eating too much getting too far or Sometimes even not training hard enough or just being simply under a COVID as well. Okay Yeah, I haven't seen like for I you do it as much, but when it gets higher I've seen situations where We've just taken a break because that's been the case, but it's not for everybody You know, I mean it is not something I've seen across the board Especially when guys get older is where I start to see that That was all we had man. We had a bunch of good stuff here today If you enjoyed the podcast and you enjoyed Cuba's drumming is Let us know if you're going to do it but I do apologize, but I'm just having my night time drink now. Are you just having my yeah? I'm just having a melatonin. Okay 60 milligrams let's go. Oh, you hit that melatonin hard, huh? Yeah, I do like the melatonin board. You know what I have since Dante made up post I've traveled I've traveled it myself And maybe it's actually actually works and guess what what Dante says It generally does work guys. He's not a It's not a beginner in this stuff. I'll be honest. So I have been doing 60 milligrams just as a Standard dose and I don't feel groggy Okay, literally jump out of bed or key is not having it right before bed I don't feel like I don't feel that melatonin actually looks best when you have it Right before bed. I take it around 90 minutes before sleep. So okay I'm actually actually I'm going to sleep in about an hour Okay, so I am a little bit a little bit a little bit later unusual But I'll probably asleep in that 90 minutes. So I do sleep the time in his It's still pretty decent and then I've got my Dream sleep from Tray by JP, all right, which is Magnetism I'll trip to find five HCP and some of the cooling greens I should look at them as well I like that and then I've got a joint formula in there as well That will do me nicely for the evening.
